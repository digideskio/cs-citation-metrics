              <Para>Urban regions are very important in relation to air quality and climate change because they represent the main areas of anthropogenic emissions and a high proportion of the population lives in urbanized regions and is therefore exposed to the resulting air pollution. The concentration gradient between an urban region and its surrounding rural area is mainly caused by different emission density and composition, different land use, as well as by meteorological effects. In this study PM10 measurement data from the AirBase database for the years 2003–2008 are selected in order to determine the gradient between urban and rural background concentrations. To analyse whether a chemistry transport model (CTM) is able to reproduce the observed gradient and to investigate the chemical composition of PM10 in urban and rural regions, simulation runs were performed with the CTM LOTOS-EUROS [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00043">3</CitationRef>] for 2003–2008 on a 0.5° × 0.25° lon-lat grid covering Europe (LE_eu) with ECMWF input meteorology. A second run for the year 2008 on a 0.25° × 0.125° lon-lat grid covering The Netherlands and Germany (LE_zoom) was performed to investigate the impact of different horizontal grid resolutions on the modeled PM10 concentrations in urban and rural regions.</Para>
              <Para>The air pollution situation in future is expected to change because meteorological conditions are influenced by climate change and the emission intensity is reduced when emission reductions plans are carried out. The effect of meteorological conditions differs for each pollutant (e.g. ozone and PM) and because PM consists of several components with different physical and chemical properties, the effect of meteorology on the individual component varies as well. As a consequence the impact of a changing climate on air pollution levels and the PM composition might differ between an urban and the surrounding rural region and therefore also the concentration gradient might change. In this study a one-way coupled model system consisting of the regional climate model RACMO2 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00044">4</CitationRef>] and LOTOS-EUROS is used to investigate the effect of climate change on PM concentrations and composition. Different sets of simulations were produced, for which the output of the GCMs ECHAM5 and MIROC with SRES-A1B for the time period 1970–2060 as well as ERA-interim data for the time period 1989–2009 were dynamically downscaled on a 0.5° × 0.25° grid using RACMO. LOTOS-EUROS runs were then forced with the resulting outputs (LE_ERA, LE_ECHAM, LE_MIROC). Anthropogenic emissions (MACC2005) were kept constant for these runs to focus on the impact of meteorology.</Para>
              <Para>The main focus in this study is on the urban Ruhr area which is located in the west of Germany and characterized by a dense cluster of cities, industries and road networks, surrounded by a rural area with mainly forest and agriculture. For the Ruhr area, four rural stations and four urban stations were selected in this study.</Para>

              <Para>The two different horizontal grid resolutions had only a small effect on the modeled PM10 concentrations and the gradient between urban and rural regions. Therefore the LE_eu run and the LE_RACMO simulation runs are used to determine a concentration gradient.</Para>
              <Para>For the Ruhr area lowest concentrations but large differences between the stations are found in the surrounding rural area, whereas the concentrations at stations in the urban area are highest and very similar for the average of the years 2003–2008 (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00041">4.1</InternalRef>, left). The average over every urban and over every rural stations results in a concentration gradient of 7.3 μg/m<Superscript>3</Superscript> (34.8 %). The model underestimates the averaged PM10 concentrations but the variability of concentration between the stations is still reproduced (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00041">4.1</InternalRef>, left). This also holds for the gradient, which is underestimated when considering the absolute difference due to the underestimation of PM10. But if the gradient is expressed as a percentage the difference between model results and observation is only small. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00041">

But simulated concentrations were different for the run using ECHAM and the one using MIROC boundary conditions and both runs differed significantly from the present-day simulations with ERA-interim forcing with small implications for the gradient (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00041">4.1</InternalRef>, right).</Para>

The differences are smaller than differences between LE_ERA and LE_ECHAM, LE_MIROC respectively.

              <Para>Observations of PM10 showed a concentration gradient between an urban and the surrounding rural region, which was reproduced by the model. LOTOS-EUROS indicated that the gradient was mainly due to higher concentrations of the primary components and elemental carbon in the urban region. The model underestimated the absolute concentrations and the gradient, due to the lack of a good description of the formation of secondary organic aerosol and dust emissions, and potentially other processes and species. The finding that the grid resolution hardly affects the gradient allows the conclusion that the RACMO – LOTOS-EUROS runs can be used to investigate the impact of climate change on the concentration gradient from urban areas to rural regions. On average the effect of the future climate runs on PM10 is only small, therefore emission changes could be more important than climate change for air pollution in future. Previous studies showed considerable biases in the climate model results [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00041">1</CitationRef>] and that the CTM underestimates the variability of PM with meteorology [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00042">2</CitationRef>]. Therefore uncertainties in the model system for both the climate model and the CTM have to be considered when interpreting the model results.</Para>

              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: The formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) is not included in the model version used for this study. Due to the dependency of the formation of SOA on meteorological parameters, SOA is important to consider when discussing the impact of climate change on air quality. And because the precursors of SOA have different emission sources (anthropogenic, biogenic) which are also depending on the location (urban or rural region), SOA might also contribute to the concentration gradient.</SimplePara>

                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: The model under-estimated measurements of PM10. Can this be partly attributed to the water content contained in measurements of particulate matter?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: The analytical results from the chemical speciation of measured PM10 mass always show a certain percentage of unexplained mass. This unknown part is anticipated to be to a high fraction water. This water content in the measurements of PM is not taken into account in the model and contributes therefore to the underestimation of PM10. But several other important components of PM10 are not yet included in the model as for example SOA and windblown dust, furthermore emissions are uncertain just as the description of some processes in the model. This also contributes significantly to the underestimate of PM10.</SimplePara>
