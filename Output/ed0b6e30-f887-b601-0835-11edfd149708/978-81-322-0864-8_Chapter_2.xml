          <Para TextBreak="No">The unwanted plants that grow in the wetland are termed as aquatic weeds. They generally grow in the fields and compete with crops for water, soil nutrients, light and space, and crop yields are reduced. They also harbour insect pests and microorganisms. Weeds belong to the class Angiospermae (flowering plants) which have two subclasses: Monocotyledoneae (monocots) and Dicotyledoneae (dicots).

A number of chemicals are used for controlling some submerged aquatic weeds by dissolving or emulsifying them in water in canals, ditches, ponds and lakes. Some chemicals in use are aqualin, aromatic solvents, chlorinated benzenes, copper sulphate, endothall, Fenac, sodium arsenite and 2,4-D. Unwanted aquatic plants are the number one pond maintenance problem. With the arrival of warm temperatures, they annoy pond owners and create problems throughout the summer and fall. Depending on the species and abundance of these weeds, it is often necessary to control them. Aside from the aesthetic value of a well-kept pond, an over abundance of weeds can create a hazard for aquatic life, offensive odours, breeding grounds for mosquitoes and a hindrance to water sports. There are three basic ways of controlling aquatic weeds. Mechanical, biological and chemical aquatic weeds are those unabated plants which grow and complete their life cycle in water and cause harm to aquatic environment directly and to related eco-environment relatively. Water is one of most important natural resource and in fact basis of all life forms on this planet. Therefore, appropriate management of water from source to its utilisation is necessary to sustain the normal function of life. It is one important part of natural resource management. Quarantines are legislative tools that may be used to mitigate the effect of weeds. Quarantine is defined as the restriction imposed by duly constituted authorities, whereby the production, movement or existence of plants, plant products, animals, animal products, any other article or material or the normal activity of persons are brought under regulation in order that introduction or spread of a pest may be prevented or restricted. If a pest has already been introduced and established in a small area, a quarantine is necessary so that it may be controlled or eradicated or dissemination stopped in newer areas, thereby reducing the losses that would otherwise occur through damage done by pest.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">The unwanted plants that grow in the wetland are termed as aquatic weeds. They generally grow in the fields and compete with crops for water, soil nutrients, light and space, and crop yields are reduced. They also harbour insect pests and microorganism. The inhibitors or poisonous substances released into soil by certain weeds are harmful to the plants, human beings and livestocks. They block the drainage and impede the flow of water in canals and water-transport channels, and their growth in the rivers makes navigation very difficult. The water pollution is increased by the dense growth of the weeds in water because they deoxygenate the water and kill the fish.</Para>

        <Section1 ID="Sec2">
          <Heading>Natural Powers of Weeds</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Weed seeds are likely to germinate earlier, their seedlings grow faster, they flower earlier and form seeds in profusion and maturation is earlier than the crop they infest. Nature has bestowed these qualities on weeds so that there seeds are collected unwarily along with the produce of the crop at harvest and get distributed to other places where the produce may be taken. They have the remarkable capacity to germinate under varied conditions, but very characteristically, they are season-bound and the peak period of germination always takes place in certain seasons in regular succession year after year. Another characteristic of the weed seeds is the possession by them of the phenomenon of dormancy which is an intrinsic physiological power of the seed to resist germination even under favourable conditions, and also the seeds do not lose their viability for years even under adverse conditions.</Para>
        </Section1>
        <Section1 ID="Sec3">
          <Heading>Types of Weeds</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Weeds belong to the class Angiospermae (flowering plants) which have two subclasses: Monocotyledoneae (monocots) and Dicotyledoneae (dicots). On the basis of the habitats, they are divided into terrestrial and aquatic categories, and on the basis of the duration of life, they are divided into annuals, biennials and perennials. Annuals live and produce their seeds in a single growing season. Biennials need two growing seasons; in one season, they pass through their vegetative or rosette stage, followed by reproductive stage in the next season. The multiplication of both the annuals and the biennials is through seed. Perennials live indefinitely and are propagated not only through seeds but often vegetatively through underground structures, such as rhizomes, stolons, bulbs and tubers. Perennials are of two types: the simple and the creeping. The former multiply only through seeds. They have no normal means of spreading vegetatively. However, if they are injured or cut, the severed portion produces new plants. Creeping perennials are spread by creeping roots, creeping above-ground stems and creeping underground stems. Some weeds propagate themselves by means of tubers which are modified rhizomes adapted for the storage of food.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Aquatic weeds are classified into three types, namely, submerged, emersed and floating. Submerged aquatics are anchored to the bottom of the habitats, for example, a ditch, can grow entirely beneath the surface of the water. Emersed ones have their roots beneath the surface of the water, but the leaves and stems are above the waterline. Floating weeds or surfaced aquatics either float freely on the water or float only in a limited area. There is still another group of weed known as the parasitic weeds. These are of two kinds: the total parasite and the partial parasites. These weeds parasitize certain host plants, which they directly attack, and deprive them of water, nutrients and assimilates.</Para>

            <Heading>Crop–Weed Competition</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In nonirrigated areas, the competition between weeds and crops is largely for water. The transpiration coefficients for <Emphasis Type="Italic">kunda (Ischaemum pilosum), hariyali (Cynodon dactylon)</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Tephrosia purpurea</Emphasis> are 556, 813 and 1,108, respectively, whereas this coefficient is only 430 for <Emphasis Type="Italic">jowar (Sorghum vulgare).</Emphasis> A saving of 750–1,250 ton of water per hectare of soil, forming a 1-m-deep column, is possible by keeping the soil free from weeds. In irrigated tracts, the competition is severe for nutrients. The unchecked growth of weeds, in a wheat fields measuring 1 ha, removes about 20 kg of nitrogen, reducing the grain yield by about 12 quintals. The mineral requirements of weeds are high. Wild mustard <Emphasis Type="Italic">(Brassica sinensis)</Emphasis> requires twice as much nitrogen, twice as much phosphorus, four times as much potash and four times as much water as a cultivated oat plant. Weeds in a fallow land deplete the soils of both moisture and nutrients. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Pohli (Carthamus oxyacantha)</Emphasis> removes about 60 kg of nitrogen from 1 ha.</Para>

          <Section2 ID="Sec6">
            <Heading>The Identification of Weeds</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Both the nature of the weeds and that of the crops which they infest influence the action of the weedicides. For example, the same types of weeds occur in maize and cotton which are <Emphasis Type="Italic">kharif</Emphasis> crops. 2,4-D can be used for killing the weeds in maize, but this weedicide should never be used on cotton which is highly sensitive to it. The successful application of chemicals to smother the weeds in growing crops is determined by the knowledge one has regarding the biology of both the crops and the weeds. The degree of success from the adoption of physical methods of weed removal is determined largely by the knowledge one has of the peak periods when the seeds of weeds are formed and of the nature or duration of their dormancy.</Para>
          </Section2>
          <Section2 ID="Sec7">
            <Heading>Preventive Measures</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Nature has provided weeds with a number of devices that help them to be disseminated widely. The agencies that facilitate the dispersal of weed seeds far and wide are water, wind and animals, including man. The troubles that weeds create in crops, soil and water are summed up in the adage ‘one year of seedling is seven years of weeding’. To avoid such a situation, a wise step is to follow the principle ‘prevention is better than cure’.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">As weed seeds are so readily dispersed by natural agencies and by the farmer himself, it is important to prevent weeds, whether in crops, on borders or bunds, in fences or in irrigation channels, from flowering and setting seed. Preventive methods consist in sowing crop seeds not contaminated with weed seeds, using manure and irrigation water not laden with them and the enforcement of weed control laws and seed-certification measures.</Para>
          </Section2>
          <Section2 ID="Sec8">
            <Heading>Control Methods</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Measures against weeds comprise mechanical (cultivation and moving), cultural or cropping, biological and chemical means. Each of these methods has certain merits, and a prudent farmer can make use of one means or a combination of them to control weeds efficiently and economically.</Para>
            <Section3 ID="Sec9">
              <Heading>Mechanical Methods</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Hand-pulling or hand-weeding, hoeing, tilling, mowing, burning, flooding, smothering, etc. are examples of physical methods of weed control, involving the use of physical energy through implements, either manual, bullock-drawn or power-operated. Hand-weeding is the most efficient method, but it is back-breaking, time-consuming and costly. With the gradual industrialization of our country, coupled with the raising of standards of living and literacy, manual labour is becoming scarce. Tillage is a practical and economical method of controlling annual weeds. The plough, the harrow and the cultivator are implements in use to eradicate weeds.</Para>
            </Section3>
            <Section3 ID="Sec10">
              <Heading>Cultural or Cropping Methods</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Weeds under many conditions are better competitors than crop plants for light, water, nutrients and soil space. However, farming practices are capable of changing the condition in such a way as to enable the crop plants to compete with weeds successfully or to reduce their interference to the minimum and thus preventing them from acting as impediments to increased crop production. Seeds with good germination will give the crop a vigorous and close stand and thus enable it to steal a march on the weeds. Varieties which are well adapted to a region will obviously compete better with the weeds than varieties poorly adapted to it. The plant breeder has to evolve quick-growing and short-duration varieties of crop plants with a large leaf area and good branching, and the agronomist has to work out the proper seed rate, depth, time and method of sowing and applying the most effective methods of irrigation and fertilisers and adopt a proper system of rotation. Some crops can compete better with weeds than others. For instance, crops like Sudan grass, sorghum and cowpea are good competitors, while crops, such as linseed, groundnut and lentil, are poor competitors. The raising of highly competitive crops is useful in reducing weed infestations. One disadvantage from which many smother crops suffer is that their seedlings grow slowly. If these crops are grown for seed, some measures have necessarily to be taken to control weeds in the early growth of these crops. However, if they are meant for fodder, the thick sowing resulting in dense growth smothers the weeds.</Para>
            </Section3>
            <Section3 ID="Sec11">
              <Heading>Chemical Methods</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The controlling of weeds in the growing crops with weedicides increases their yields and ensures the efficient use of irrigation, fertilisers and plant-protection measures, such as the spraying of insecticides and fungicides. The removal of weeds from the growing crops facilitates easy harvesting and gives a high-quality produce without admixture with weed seeds. Chemical weed control can be adopted quite in time and in situations and under conditions which make manual or mechanical weeding difficult. A great advantage of this method lies in killing weeds in the crop row or in the immediate vicinity of crop plants. The chemical method is easier, less time-consuming and less costly than weeding by hired labourers.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Formulation refers to the way in which the basic weed-killing chemicals are prepared for practical use. Herbicides are formulated to be applied as solutions in water or oil, emulsions, wettable powders, granules and dusts.</Para>

              <Heading>Solutions of Water or Oils</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The salts of most herbicides are soluble in water. They are dissolved in convenient amounts of water and then sprayed. A few examples are sodium and amine salts of 2, 4-d, 2 and 4,5-T; MCPA; amine salts of DNBP; sodium salts of pentachlorophenol, TCA and dalapon. The ‘parent acid’ formulations of some of these are soluble in oil (DNBP, PCP). They are often used to increase the toxicity of oil sprays or to fortify the oil.</Para>

              <Heading>Emulsions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">An emulsion is one liquid dispersed in another liquid, each maintaining its original identity. The two liquids are prevented from reacting with each other by the addition of an emulsifying agent. Ester formulations of 2,4-D are oil-like and form emulsions. Emulsions are milky.</Para>

              <Heading>Wettable Powder</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">It is a type of formulation in which a herbicide is absorbed generally on an inert carrier, together with an added surface-acting agent, and finely ground so that it will form a suspension when agitated with water. Simazine, atrazine, monuron, diuron and neburon are wettable powders.</Para>

              <Heading>Granular Herbicides</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In these formulations, the herbicide is absorbed or, mixed with or impregnated into a generally inert carrier in such a way that the final product consists of granular particles. Many carriers are used, for example, clay, sand vermiculite and finely ground plant parts. Granular materials can be spread by hand or with mechanical spreaders. These materials have advantages over sprays, because water is not needed for application, costlier spraying equipment is dispensed with and the granules fall off the leaves of valuable plants without causing injury. Another advantage is that as the active weed-killing principle in these formulations is gradually released, they suppress the growth of weeds for long.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">The quantity of the toxic ingredients, to which the weed-killing property of a chemical is due, is different in different formulations of herbicides. The active ingredient is that part of a chemical formulation which is directly responsible for the herbicidal effects. In some herbicides, the entire molecule may be the active unit. If the chemical is 99% pure, it is considered to have 99% active ingredient. The strength of the wettable powders is expressed in terms of the active ingredient (a.i.). In others, the herbicidal activity is calculated on an acid-equivalent basis. The acid equivalent (a.e.) refers to that part of a formulation which can be theoretically attributed to the acid. In these cases, the acid equivalent is given as the active ingredient. Examples are 2, 4-D, MCPA, MCPB, 2,4-DB, CMPP and picloram.</Para>

            <Heading>Damages Caused by Aquatic Weeds</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Aquatic weeds are those unabated plants which grow and complete their life cycle in water and cause harm to aquatic environment directly and to related eco-environment relatively. Water is one of most important natural resource and in fact basis of all life forms on this planet. Therefore, appropriate management of water from source to its utilisation is necessary to sustain the normal function of life. It is one important part of natural resource management. The presence of excessive aquatic vegetation influences the management of water in natural waterways, man-made canals and reservoirs which amounts to millions of kilometres/square kilometres of such waterbodies around the world. The area under small tanks and ponds is equally important due to the establishment of many small irrigation schemes and watershed management projects all over the world. For example, India has 1.9 m ha underwater in reservoirs and 1.2 m ha under irrigation canals. The area under village ponds and tanks is nearly 2.2 m ha. Aquatic weeds often reduce the effectiveness of waterbodies for fish production. Aquatic weeds can assimilate large quantities of nutrients from the water reducing their availability for planktonic algae. They may also cause reduction in oxygen levels and present gaseous exchange with water resulting in adverse fish production. Although excessive weed growth may provide protective cover in water for small fish growth, it may also interfere with fish harvesting. Dense growth of aquatic weeds may provide ideal habitat for the development of mosquitoes causing malaria, encephalitis and filariasis. These weeds may also serve as vectors for disease-causing organisms and can greatly reduce the aesthetic value of waterbodies from a recreational point of view. Aquatic weeds have been found to severely reduce the flow capacity of irrigation canals, thereby reducing the availability of water to the farmers field. Aquatic weeds may also damage pumps and turbines in super thermal power stations and hydroelectric power stations influencing electric production and increasing the cost of maintenance of power stations. Many aquatic plants are desirable since they may play temporarily a beneficial role in reducing agricultural, domestic and industrial pollution. Many aquatic weeds may play a useful role of providing continuous supply of phytoplanktons and help fish production.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Aquatic weeds (emergent, floating and submerged) interfere with the static and flow of water system. They cause tremendous loss of water from waterbodies like lakes and dams through evapotranspiration. In flowing water system, aquatic weeds impede the flow of water in irrigation canals and drainage channels, thereby increasing evaporation damage structures in canals and dams, clog gates, siphons, valves, bridge piers, pump, etc. Impediment in flow of water may result in localised floods in neighbouring areas. India has the largest canal network in the world where the velocity of flowing water is reduced by about 30–40% due to the presence of aquatic weeds. Floating and deep-rooted submerged weeds interfere with navigation. Water hyacinth and Alligator weed grow profusely and create dense mats which prevent the movement of boats and at times even large ships. Village ponds and tanks get infested with floating and submerged weeds which results in reducing the capacity of the water storage and therefore effecting efficient irrigation. Therefore, considering the losses caused, it is essential to keep aquatic weeds under control in waterbodies, flow water systems, ponds and tanks so that these systems can be utilised to best of their efficiency.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Mechanical methods are being practised at present as use of chemicals is very much restricted due to the difficulty in control on water use for different purposes. Use of bioagents for weed control is under experimental dissemination and needs further research and refinement in technology for control of aquatic weeds. Within the next two decades, bioagents will be one of the major methods of controlling aquatic weeds, especially the floating ones. Research is also necessary for studying the various factors influencing the aquatic environment and the resultant vegetation. Researchers are envisaging to establish an integrated approach to aquatic weed control using a mix of mechanical and biocidal techniques to control aquatic weeds under specific situations.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">These weeds grow in shallow waters and situations existing near the waterbodies where water recedes and rises with the seasons or regular releases from a large waterbody or reservoir. Most of such situations are of permanent in nature where minimum and maximum water levels are consistent. Such situations include banks of canals, rivers, periphery of waterbodies which are mostly in earthen dams and partly in masonry dams, drainage ditches and water ponds near villages. These weeds may be called semiaquatic but more appropriately referred to as emergent aquatic weeds. Some examples of the emergent weeds are given below:<Table Float="No" ID="Taba">

            <Para TextBreak="No">These are plants which grow and complete their life cycle in water. They vary in size from single cell (algae) and may grow up to large vascular plants. In case of drying of waterbodies, most of them give their seeds and other vegetative reproductive organs in base ground lands. These weeds are observed in the surface of the large, deep and shallow depths of waterbodies; deep continuous flowing canals and continuously flowing rivers, large ponds, tanks, etc. Some of the weeds in this ecosystem freely float and move long distances, while some of them do float on the water surface but anchor down to soil at the bottom of the waterbody. These weed species make loss of water through evapotranspiration in addition to impediment caused in flow of water. Therefore, these weeds can be classified in two subgroups, namely, (a) free-floating and (b) rooted floating weeds. Examples of common weeds under each subgroup are given below:<Table Float="No" ID="Tabc">

            <Para TextBreak="No">Weed species belonging to this group germinate/sprout, grow and reproduce beneath the water surface. Their roots and reproductive organs remain in the soil at the bottom of the waterbody. These weeds damage the maximum, because they are not visible on the surface and impede the flow of water varying upon the degree of their intensity and growth. Most of these weeds are found in shallow and medium deep waterbodies and continuous flowing canals and drainage ditches. The ecosystem provides situations which allows the growth of algae, filamentous algae and higher algae in shallow water situations and under deep water situations, and thus, submerged weeds may be further categorised as (a) shallow water submerged weeds and (b) deep water submerged weeds. Commonly occurring weeds in these categories are as follows:<Table Float="No" ID="Tabd">

            <Heading>Algae</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The fresh and saline water exposed to sunlight provide ideal ecological environment to algal growth. Majority of them are purely aquatic in nature and adapt to live in ponds, lakes, streams, swimming pools and oceans. Freshwater algae are grouped as planktonic and filamentous in nature. Planktonic algae may colour the water as green, yellow, red and black. They may physically look as scums or water bloom. Physiologically they use solar energy to convert it into food, use CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> from water during photosynthesis (in day) and produce oxygen as by-product. During dark hours, they release CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> through respiration and consume O<Subscript>2</Subscript>. Some of the algae maintain balance in natural aquatic environments as they produce O<Subscript>2</Subscript> and provide food for most of the fish and other aquatic animals. Although under normal conditions algae are beneficial, their overpopulation may be undesirable for domestic and commercial water uses. Excessive phytoplanktonic booms may result to zooplanktonic developments which deplete oxygen and lead to eutrophication which may prove destructive to fish and other aquatic wildlife. Dense growth of planktonic algae will create shade, thus reducing light to the bottom of waterbody, and this may prevent germination of seeds, growth of rooted submerged weeds and may result in destabilisation of aquatic environment occurs. Generally, they do not disturb irrigation systems but may spoil the places of recreation value like swimming due to bad odours and scum created on water surface. Some of them may prove toxic to fish, birds and domestic animals. The filamentous algae consist of thread-like structures or filaments made of single cells attached end to end. They do not have roots, stems, etc. and grow in cool and warm waters. They cause immense nuisance in irrigation system. The important genera include <Emphasis Type="Italic">Chara, Nitella, Spirogyra, Hydrodictyon, Cladophora and Pithophora.</Emphasis> The filamentous and planktonic algae produce undesirable odours and spoil the taste of drinking water, interfere with domestic and industrial usage and clog the filters of the water treatment plants. They also provide a coating to cooling towers and condensers. The filamentous algae clog the weirs and lining of the canals thereby interfere with the irrigation system. It may also adversely influence the fish production.</Para>

These plants are structurally different from meso or xerophytes. They have less-developed protective and conductive tissues. They have extensive arrangement for buoyancy and aeration, particularly in ground tissue of petiole and leaf mesophyll and cortex of stem and root.</Para>

              <Heading>Emergent Weeds</Heading>

          <Heading>Effect of Aquatic Weeds on Environment</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Aquatic weeds create number of environmental problems. They create situations which are ideal for mosquito growth. The mosquitoes are sheltered and protected from their predators by aquatic weed roots and leafy growth and are responsible for the spread of malaria, yellow fever, river blindness and encephalitis. Snails are able to multiply, playing a crucial role in the life cycle of blood and liver flukes (parasitic worms) as they shelter and find sustenance among the root zones. Schistosomiasis and fascioliasis diseases spread as the floating weed carries the snails to new locations. People living close to these areas complain of mosquito problems. Fish production is greatly affected by the presence of floating and submerged aquatic weeds. Isolated weed beds may be tolerated, providing shelter and shade for fish, but when the growth becomes thick and covers entire waterbody, it can be lethal for fish growth. Fish may suffocate from a lack of oxygen and may cause death. When floating and submerged aquatic weeds become extremely dense, many fish species are unable to exist in such environments and vanish. For example, fishes production in Harike lake in Punjab is decreasing and is a matter of concern to all. The decomposition of huge amounts of biological mass creates condition where CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> and carbon monoxide are produced and released to the atmosphere. The decomposition period is much less than decomposition of other vegetation on land. The decomposition creates emissions of foul smells which are unpleasant to public convenience. Mosquitoes and other parasites grow in these situations and affect the life of those living in close proximity.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Waterbodies which are places of recreational and aesthetic use are badly affected by unwanted growth of aquatic weeds. The decomposition of weed material consists of siliceous material and other insoluble salts which settle on the bottom of the waterbody. Dense weed growth slows the flow of water in rivers, canals and drainage ditches allowing silt to settle out and be deposited on the bed of the waterbody. This increase in silt deposition raises the bed level and finally affects the life of lakes, dams, tanks, etc. and requires expenditure to be increased for frequent desilting through dredging. Aquatic weeds also affect quality of water. These weeds cause taste and odour problems and also increase biological oxygen demand because of organic loading. They increase the organic matter content of water which may affect the strength of the concrete structures when used as curing and mixing water. It is due to the organic matter that combines with cement to reduce bond strength and may cause large amount of air entrained in concrete.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Aquatic weeds impede the free flow of water which may contribute to increased seepage and may cause rises in water tables in the adjoining areas. It may lead to water logging. This may also create saline or alkaline conditions in the soil and also give rise to many other land weeds. Submerged and floating weeds propagate at a tremendous rate. The surface floating weeds get interwoven and form dense mats that move downstream. Often these moving mats pack up against bridges and structures creating enormous pressure that sometimes results in serious damage being caused. An example of this sort of damage was observed on Kasur Nala near Taran Taaran in India. Over time if left unchecked, the weed mats become so dense that people and animals can walk on them, although at the risk of injury or drowning.</Para>

This does not only improve availability but also the conveyance efficiency. Irrigation and drainage systems provide favourable conditions for the growth of aquatic weeds which interfere with the storage and delivery systems of irrigation water and maintenance of canals, drains, barrages, lakes, ponds, etc. These systems often get choked with the weeds and cause environmental pollution. On low-lying areas, adjoining irrigation and drainage channels, soil salinity and alkalinity problems do arise.

Quarantine is defined as the restriction imposed by duly constituted authorities, whereby the production, movement or existence of plants, plant products, animals, animal products, any other article or material or the normal activity of persons is brought under regulation in order that introduction or spread of a pest may be prevented or restricted. If a pest has already been introduced and established in a small area, a quarantine is necessary so that it may be controlled or eradicated or dissemination stopped in newer areas, thereby reducing the losses that would otherwise occur through damage done by pest. The success of preventive weed management programmes varies with weed species, its biology, means of dissemination and the amount of effort needed to be applied. Preventive weed programmes usually require community action through enactment and enforcement of appropriate laws and regulations.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In India, irrigation canals appear to be a potential source for spreading water hyacinth. Recently preventive weed management approach has been reviewed. When prevention and eradication fail to give desired results under aquatic environment, the only alternative left is to keep aquatic weeds under manageable limits so that water-use efficiency with respect of water storage in reservoirs and transportation through canals is not reduced. Management of aquatic weeds in water reservoirs, canals, drainage systems, ponds, etc. consists of following systems approach of aquatic weed management, that is, following prevention, eradication and control techniques based on the habitat and type of weed flora present in a given situation. These situations may result in serious reduction in water flow in irrigation and drainage systems which may result in flooding, salinity and alkalinity.

It may also involve any physical power which may directly or indirectly inhibit the growth and development of aquatic weeds. This could be done manually by hand, using hand tools or machine power. It may also consist of altering the environment or creating conditions/situations which may inhibit or do not permit growth and development of weeds. The advantages of mechanical methods include utilisation of available manpower resources, environmental friendly and target specific, yield immediate results, nonselective (under specific situations) and provide fewer chances of permitting ecological shifts in aquatic flora. Mechanical methods often reduce massive nutrient load of eutropic waterbodies, helping indirectly in diminishing the future weed population. Harvested weeds may have various utilities such as feed, manure and energy source, and most importantly, mechanical methods can be exercised in any localised area of waterbodies.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The limitations include limited effectiveness as in some cases aquatic weeds regrow up from their rootstocks, rhizomes.

A dredger is a machine equipped with a forked bucket which can be opened and closed on command. The machine could operate from the ground or from a boat in water. Dredging is done in large waterbodies, canals and drains. It is a common method of cleaning ditches but slow, time-consuming and is a costly operation. Small lakes, water reservoirs, etc. get silted if area surrounding them is under cultivation or surrounded by erodible lands with poor afforestation.

Mowing is effective on tall growing plants. Repeated mowing not only prevents seed production of emergent weeds but may also starve the underground parts which store carbohydrate reserves and provide energy to vegetative reproductive organs. The best time to mow is when carbohydrate reserves are low. For many species, it is when the active growth phase is over and the time of flowering initiation starts. Repeated mowing hastens carbohydrate depletion and slows death of plants. Generally, this practice effectively controls emergent weeds on canals, water reservoirs, banks, etc. Where gradient in ditches is smooth and not too steep, the underwater cutters can be used to control emergent and submerged weeds. The effect of mowing is short lived. The operation needs to be done frequently to exhaust carbohydrate resources. Therefore, this process does not give any effective control on long-term basis. Pasturing is the economical and effective way in controlling marginal grasses, weeds, etc. A good legume grass mixture if properly managed and grazed will give a lawn-like appearance. A good sod shall also protect banks of canals, drains and dams against erosion.

Control is achieved by either dehydration of the vegetation or by exposure to low temperatures. In tanks, fish ponds and canals, emptying the water periodically to kill the weeds susceptible to desiccation is practised. To kill submersed weeds in the canals of Bhakra canal system in Haryana (India) and in Chambal command area (India) in Rajasthan, exposure to sun is given by draining the water, and this practice prevents regrowth for nearly 6 months. Cutting of the aerial shots of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Typha</Emphasis> spp. at flowering stage and keeping the stubble submerged under the water for 4 weeks controlled <Emphasis Type="Italic">Typha</Emphasis>. Under such cases, there may be disadvantages in lowering the water level as it may induce production of vegetative propagules or sexual reproduction. Therefore, in such cases, weeds should be removed quickly and the sediments should be dried completely. Planting of trees on the banks of canals may create shade to reduce light intensity hence checking the weed growth. Light intensity can also be checked by adding dyes to the water. This type of control is more effective in static water such as ponds or tanks where dye remains suspended for a longer time. Drying or water-level manipulation is generally practised in flowing water system like irrigation canals and drainage ditches. During the process, the water is removed and the base of the tanks, canals, etc. is made dry by exposing the land to sun and air. This totally changes the eco-environment, which is very adverse to the eco-environment required for growth and development of submerged weeds. Frequent drying and wetting for several days may control the growth of roots and propagules in the bottom soil. This method is not effective for control of emergent weeds.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Light is an essential component of the photosynthetic process, which is necessary for the growth and development of aquatic plants, especially submersed aquatic weeds. Growth of submerged aquatic plants in small tanks and ponds can be checked by reducing light penetration. Use of fibre glass screen is popular in some countries. Colouring chemicals have also been tried for intercepting solar radiation reaching the water. Ponds that are adequately fertilised develop millions of tiny plants which give the water a cloudy appearance (bloom). If this water is nearly 75 cm deep, submerged aquatic weeds have almost no chance to grow. A light-coloured object should not be visible at around 50 cm below the surface. This practice should be followed where there is little loss of water from the pond. Some object to it as unclean water but that is not the case. The bloom induced by fertiliser application is not considered as bad for health. The proper construction of a tank is very important for controlling pondweeds. Many rooted aquatic plants do not establish in deep water. Therefore, tanks should generally be deeper than 1 m. The slope at the bank should not be more than 2 m, that is, the angle of slope should be steep, that is, around 3:1, and this will help in reducing the area where infestations of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Typha, rushes</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">sedges</Emphasis> could establish. This may be dangerous for access, but flatter separate slopes can be provided at one or two location in the pond for general access.</Para>

              <Heading>Breaking of Anchorage</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Submerged aquatic weeds can only survive if there is optimum sunlight. In shallow water, optimum light may penetrate to the bed level allowing plants to anchor and take root at the base of the distributary, water course, shallow pond, etc. In case of canals, barrages and tanks with deeper water levels, the light may not reach the bed level. Under such situation, weeds may form anchorage on the inside banks of the irrigation system. In an experiment conducted at Nirwan Branch near Patiala (India), a canal was heavily infested with submerged weeds. Divers cleared the bed of weed. Thereafter, a plough was lowered in the canal along with wooden floats which were connected with a tractor and pulled upstream of canal. However, no weed could be brought out from the bed. It is important to check where the weeds are anchored and growing from so that they can be successfully managed. Alternatively, side walls may be covered with coloured polyethylene to exclude all light penetration and facilitate early decomposition of the plant materials.</Para>

            <Heading>Biological Control of Weeds</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Biological management of aquatic weeds is a broad term for the exploitation of living organisms or their products to reduce or prevent the growth and reproduction of weeds. The organisms that are used for biological control are diverse, for example, insects, pathogens, nematodes, parasitic and competing plants. Biological control involves the deliberate use of organisms such as insects or fungi to control weeds.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Biological control is more complex than chemical control because it requires (a) long-term planning, (b) multiple tactics and (c) manipulation of cropping system to interact with the environment and has attempted to work out the total releases made against weeds by biological agents. It was found that after 13 releases of agents for classical control of weeds in the first decade of this century, the number of releases per decade increased nearly exponentially.</Para>

Biological control is considered to be one of the most safest approaches. Any plant-feeding organism may be used to control aquatic weeds provided; it does not harm plants of economic value or create undesirable imbalances in the plant community. Some of the natural enemies have been considered for control of submersed, floating and emergent weeds.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Weeds can be controlled by pathogens like fungi, bacteria, virus and virus-like agents. Among the class of pathogens, fungi have been used to a larger extent than bacterial, viral and nematode pathogens. In some cases, it has been possible to isolate, culture, formulate and disseminate fungal propagules as mycoherbicides. Several books and reviews detail the history, development prospects and technical aspects of the use of plant pathogens. Pathogens may have many advantages like (1) most pathogens of plants are fungi, (2) they are destructive, (3) they are widely prevalent, (4) most of them can be easily mass cultured and (5) they can be integrated into organised pest management systems. Most specificity is the fundamental feature. Pathogens with broad host range are unsuitable simply because they may attack the cultivated plants. Formulations of fungi applied as inundative inoculum in a manner similar to that of chemical herbicides have been termed ‘mycoherbicides’. It involves mass culturing, standardisation, formulation and application of fungi inoculum to weeds.</Para>

It is reported that <Emphasis Type="Italic">T. zilli</Emphasis> in the cooling ponds of a power station in Moscow and found it to be a great consumer of weed <Emphasis Type="Italic">Vallisneria</Emphasis>, but this fish cannot survive below 55°F. The Russians who consider fish as more valuable and more permanent agent for weed control than mechanical or chemical are using the grass carp <Emphasis Type="Italic">Ctenopharyngodon idella</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Hypophthalmichthys molitrix</Emphasis>. The former is said to be the more effective species. It feeds on a wide range of aquatic weeds such as <Emphasis Type="Italic">Potamogeton</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Lemna, Ceratophyllum, Elodea, Hydrocharis</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Vallisneria</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Myriophyllum</Emphasis>. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">C. idella</Emphasis> fish has been employed for weed control in China, Hungary and Japan and has shown promise in other regions. It feeds on a range of submerged and floating weeds but prefers plants having soft tissues. Its rate of growth and development varies with the source of food.

White amur is a poor breeder in the warm water; therefore, for weed control purposes, it is bred artificially and released in the water when fingerlings are 100 g each. About 1,500 fingerlings must be released per hectare area of water.

              <Para TextBreak="No">Water hyacinth (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Eichhornia crassipes</Emphasis>) remains the world’s most important aquatic weed. It is spreading at an alarming rate in Africa and Papua New Guinea and is a major problem in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Successful biological control can significantly reduce this weed cover in 3–10 years after establishment of an agent and has achieved excellent control in number of countries. The use of curculionid <Emphasis Type="Italic">Neochetina bruchi</Emphasis> for controlling water hyacinth was investigated in Karnataka (India) in 1984. Between February and July, a total of seven releases consisting of 1,700 beetles was made into a 20-ha tank fully infested with water hyacinth. Releases were then confirmed to an area of about 1 ha, and observations on establishment and dispersal of the beetle were made at 2-month interval. By March 1985, upto five adults were present per plant in the release area, and the insects had started dispersing to other parts of the tank. The beetle was present throughout the tank by Sept. 1985. By September 1987, about 90% control of water hyacinth had been achieved, and the remaining plants were stunted with reduced vigour. The curculionid coexists with <Emphasis Type="Italic">N. eichhorniae</Emphasis> which was also released in India from USA for biological control of this weed.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Over 7,500 adults of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Neohydronomus affinis</Emphasis> were released in Florida between April 1987 and July 1988 for biological control of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Pistia stratiotes</Emphasis>.

At some sites, <Emphasis Type="Italic">N. affinis</Emphasis> infested plants exhibited symptoms typical of plants in other countries where <Emphasis Type="Italic">N. affinis</Emphasis> has been used successfully to control this weed. The potential of North American aquatic weevil <Emphasis Type="Italic">Euhrychiopsis lecontei</Emphasis> to serve as a bioagent for an exotic weed <Emphasis Type="Italic">Myriophyllum spicatum</Emphasis> which is currently found throughout USA and Southern provinces of Canada was evaluated. This weevil was found on <Emphasis Type="Italic">M. spicatum</Emphasis> in lakes where population of the exotic weed has declined. In both lakes, there was 50% less <Emphasis Type="Italic">M. spicatum</Emphasis> biomass in enclosures with weevils than in enclosures without weevils. The results suggest that the North American insect may be suitable control agent for this introduced aquatic weed.</Para>
