              <Para TextBreak="No">Mental health problems and disorders constitute an escalating challenge in the workplace. Another chapter in this handbook by Dewa and colleagues has also addressed this important topic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2001a), mental health disorders comprise 40 % of the leading causes of disability worldwide, and they account for 10.5 % of the total global burden of disease. About 450 million people, most of them of working age, are affected by at least one mental health disorder. Importantly, mental health disorders are projected to account for 15 % of the disability burden internationally by the year 2020. Depression alone is projected to account for the second highest burden of disease, following only cardiovascular disease (Scott &amp; Dickey, 2003; WHO, 2001b). Furthermore, mental health disabilities are becoming increasingly common in the workplace. According to the Canadian Community Health Survey, in 2002, approximately one in every five individuals over the age of 15 experienced psychological symptoms over the course of the year, including depression, anxiety disorders, and alcohol or drug dependence (CCHS; Statistics Canada, 2003). Estimates exist that approximately 10 % of the working population has at least one mental health disorder (Dewa, Lin, Kooehoorn, &amp; Goldner, 2007). Given these numbers, it is not surprising that the societal costs of mental health disorders are so high. In North America, the annual societal costs are estimated at $83.1 billion (Greenberg et al., 2003) and, in the European Union, at EU$320 billion (Andlin-Sobocki, Jonsson, Wittchen, &amp; Olesen 2005). Between 30 and 60 % of the costs are losses associated with reduced productivity. In Canada, this cost has been estimated to be C$17.7 billion annually (Lim, Jacobs, Ohinmaa, Schopflocher, &amp; Dewa, 2008). Absenteeism (to be discussed later in this chapter) related to mental health problems accounts for about 7 % of the total payroll (Watson Wyatt Worldwide, 2000). Stephens and Joubert (2001) suggested that the costs to Canadian employers in lost productivity arising from presenteeism (i.e., less than optimal job performance) and absenteeism due to mental health problems are in the billions of dollars each year. Overall, mental health problems have a multifold impact on work, including diminished productivity, absenteeism, presenteeism and short-term disability, increased unemployment rates, early retirement, as well as decreased productivity related to spillover effects on coworkers and supervisors (Dewa &amp; McDaid, 2010). It therefore seems there are significant economic, social and humanitarian reasons to implement workplace initiatives which will reduce the incidence of mental health distress in the workplace, as well as to facilitate the rehabilitation of those employees affected by mental health disabilities (Dewa &amp; McDaid, 2010).</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Mental health problems and disorders constitute an escalating challenge in the workplace. Another chapter in this handbook by Dewa and colleagues has also addressed this important topic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002095">2001a</CitationRef>), mental health disorders comprise 40% of the leading causes of disability worldwide, and they account for 10.5% of the total global burden of disease. About 450 million people, most of them of working age, are affected by at least one mental health disorder. Importantly, mental health disorders are projected to account for 15% of the disability burden internationally by the year 2020. Depression alone is projected to account for the second highest burden of disease, following only cardiovascular disease (Scott &amp; Dickey, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002074">2003</CitationRef>; WHO, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002096">2001b</CitationRef>). Furthermore, mental health disabilities are becoming increasingly common in the workplace. According to the Canadian Community Health Survey, in 2002, approximately one in every five ­individuals over the age of 15 experienced psychological symptoms over the course of the year, including depression, anxiety disorders, and alcohol or drug dependence (CCHS; Statistics Canada, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002081">2003</CitationRef>). Estimates exist that approximately 10% of the working population has at least one mental health disorder (Dewa, Lin, Kooehoorn, &amp; Goldner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002026">2007</CitationRef>). Given these numbers, it is not surprising that the societal costs of mental health disorders are so high. In North America, the annual societal costs are estimated at $83.1 billion (Greenberg et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002035">2003</CitationRef>) and, in the European Union, at EU$320 billion (Andlin-Sobocki, Jonsson, Wittchen, &amp; Olesen <CitationRef CitationID="CR00203">2005</CitationRef>). Between 30 and 60% of the costs are losses associated with reduced productivity. In Canada, this cost has been estimated to be C$17.7 billion annually (Lim, Jacobs, Ohinmaa, Schopflocher, &amp; Dewa, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002051">2008</CitationRef>). Absenteeism (to be discussed later in this chapter) related to mental health problems accounts for about 7% of the total payroll (Watson Wyatt Worldwide, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002091">2000</CitationRef>). Stephens and Joubert (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002082">2001</CitationRef>) suggested that the costs to Canadian employers in lost productivity arising from presenteeism (i.e., less than optimal job performance) and absenteeism due to mental health problems are in the billions of dollars each year. Overall, mental health problems have a multifold impact on work, including diminished productivity, absenteeism, presenteeism and short-term disability, increased unemployment rates, early retirement, as well as decreased productivity related to spillover effects on coworkers and supervisors (Dewa &amp; McDaid, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002027">2010</CitationRef>). It therefore seems there are significant economic, social and humanitarian reasons to implement workplace initiatives which will reduce the incidence of mental health distress in the workplace, as well as to facilitate the rehabilitation of those employees affected by mental health disabilities (Dewa &amp; McDaid, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002027">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">However, Goldner and colleagues (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002034">2004</CitationRef>) reported that there is limited research to guide disability management practices for mental health disorders. Furthermore, despite an emerging consensus on the importance of integration of clinical treatment and vocational rehabilitation, the current literature is still fragmented, focused on selected diagnoses, and weak at identifying functional limitations cross-diagnostically. While there is an accumulated evidentiary support for employment interventions for individuals with severe mental illness, there is less of an evidence base for individuals with more common mental health problems, including anxiety and mood disorders. A recent survey conducted by Schultz and colleagues (Schultz, Milner, Hanson, &amp; Winter, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002071">2010</CitationRef>) investigated the attitudes of Canadian employers towards workers with mental health disorders. The results indicated that over 50% of the 80 Canadian employers surveyed (mid-size to large companies) had significant concerns about workers with mental health disability. The most significant concerns included mental instability (83.1%), bizarre behaviors (80.7%), inability to tolerate work pressure and stress (79.5%), becoming violent (75.9%), and being unable to tolerate working conditions (74.7%). Clearly, the improved societal attitudes and increased acceptance of workers with physical disabilities are not paralleled by workplace inclusion of individuals with mental health disorders. Social stigmatization continues to be a more salient barrier to employment than actual disability (Baldwin &amp; Marcus, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00206">2010</CitationRef>; Corrigan, Larson, &amp; Kuwabara, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002020">2007</CitationRef>; Goldner et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002034">2004</CitationRef>; Haslan, Atkinson, Brown, &amp; Haslan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002040">2005</CitationRef>)</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Of particular concern in this present chapter is the lack of an overarching conceptual model and a satisfactory evidentiary basis for best practices to support work accommodation and retention of individuals with mental health disorders. Work accommodations are defined as efforts to modify any element of a job so that it can be accomplished by a qualified person with a disability. This intervention can include accommodation aspects of the hiring process, the actual performance of the job, or the individual’s ability to enjoy the full benefits of the job (US Equal Opportunity Commission, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002087">2002</CitationRef>). The goal of this chapter is to provide readers with an understanding of current models and interventions, in both research and practice, regarding work accommodation in mental health, and to address the unresolved issues and barriers to the integration and transfer of this knowledge to practice. This chapter also reviews and integrates the themes presented in the literature, as well as highlights future research, policy, and practice directions.</Para>

            <Section1 ID="Sec00202">
              <Heading>Towards an Integrative Conceptual Framework for Work Accommodation in Mental Health</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">There is a gap between the predominance of medical and treatment-focused models for persons with mental health problems and the reality of the workplace environment. Medical models, while useful for optimizing treatment and controlling symptoms, are not useful as a framework for maximizing work capacity or job accommodations in the workplace (Schultz, Stowell, Feuerstein, &amp; Gatchel, 2007). A system-based, social model of mental health disability, with service and research emphases on function and functional accommodations, would seem more suitable (Gates &amp; Akabas, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002031">2010</CitationRef>), especially in combination with the biopsychosocial model integrating clinical and occupational ­interventions. The mismatch between the worker with mental health problems and the workplace organization is likely at the core of poor employment outcomes of persons with mental health disorders (Akabas, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00201">1994</CitationRef>; Bond, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002010">2004</CitationRef>; Gates &amp; Akabas, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002031">2010</CitationRef>; Spataro, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002079">2005</CitationRef>; Stone &amp; Colella, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002083">1996</CitationRef>). Workplace policies and practices often do not match the needs of qualified workers with mental health problems. Occupational stress, now inherent in the workplace, tends to compound functional problems individuals with mental health disorders might have with specific task and interpersonally related aspects of the work environment. As Gates and Akabas aptly emphasize, “Inclusion into the workplace is not just a function of reducing the extent to which individual characteristics and symptoms interfere with workplace policies and practices, but also a function of organizational responsiveness to these individuals as expressed through the attitudes and behaviors of management, supervisors and coworkers.” (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002031">2010</CitationRef>, p. 375). Therefore, work accommodation needs to be understood as a strategy for inclusion and social process. It involves dynamic multiparty interactions in the workplace leading, in the context of organizational readiness, to an improved match between the job and relationship requirements in the workplace on the one hand, and individual skills and needs on the other.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Currently, no guidelines for job accommodations and employment retention for persons with ­mental health disabilities have been published, despite the mounting research worldwide on similar interventions for individuals with physical and pain-related disabilities. Yet, societal, professional and economic concerns are escalating over the low rates of employment of persons with mental health disabilities, decreased productivity, “presenteeism,” premature job terminations, and lower rates of job retention. These factors, together with what some refer to as a spiraling “mental health disability epidemic” in the workplace (Dewa &amp; McDaid, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002027">2010</CitationRef>; Lerner et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002050">2010</CitationRef>), indicate a problem of significant magnitude. Research evidence to date shows a high, and increasing, prevalence of mental health disorders, accompanied by a strongly negative economic impact for society, the workplace, health care and compensation systems, and for persons with mental health disorders themselves (Baldwin &amp; Marcus, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00206">2010</CitationRef>; Dewa &amp; McDaid, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002027">2010</CitationRef>; Gnam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002033">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">To compound the problem, health care for persons with mental health disorders, despite recent advances in psychiatric vocational rehabilitation, still bears the burden of the medical model that separates mind and body and focuses on psychopathology rather than on preserved strengths and functional capacity (Schultz, Crook, Fraser, &amp; Joy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002067">2000</CitationRef>; Schultz &amp; Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002069">2005</CitationRef>; Schultz, Stowell, Feuerstein, &amp; Gatchel, 2007). Such models are ill-equipped to provide occupationally relevant and effective interventions that facilitate long term employment. The growing movement towards mental health systems based on a recovery vision may hold the promise of shifting the paradigm of mental health services from one based largely on pathology, to one that focuses on realizing potential. Recovery has gained strength internationally as an orientation to care that focuses on enabling people to move beyond the limits that are associated with mental illness, and to enjoy meaningful and valued lives in the community. A recovery-oriented vision could lead to a growing awareness of participation in work as an important outcome, along with the development of strengths-based approaches to ­support this outcome. (Mental Health Commission of Canada, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002060">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The provision of appropriate work accommodations, with the goal of enhancing employment retention for individuals with mental health disorders and preventing work disability, is challenging for many reasons. The complex and episodic nature of mental health disorders can be exacerbated by a wide range of stressors inherent in daily life and work environments. When planning workplace interventions in mental health, the specific nature of organizational, task-related and interpersonal stressors needs to be clearly identified, with a view to evolving strategies to reducing stressors and their impact, and to developing personal illness and impairment management strategies in response to these stressors. Furthermore, societal stigma and employers’ negative attitudes and fears often lead to a lack of awareness and preparation for employees with mental health disorders (Baldwin &amp; Marcus, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00206">2010</CitationRef>; Schultz, Milner, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002071">2010</CitationRef>). In an attempt to avoid stigma, individuals with mental health disorders often try to conceal their problems, resulting in adverse consequences for the workplace. The following workplace consequences of unidentified and unaddressed mental health problems in the workplace were enumerated by Harnois and Gabriel (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002039">2000</CitationRef>): absenteeism (increase in overall sickness absence, particularly frequent short periods of absence); poor health, depression, stress, and burnout; physical conditions including high blood pressure, heart disease, ulcers, sleeping disorders, skin rashes, headache, neck- and backache, and low resistance to infections; changes in work performance, also known as presenteeism (reduction in productivity and output, increase in error rates, increased amount of accidents, poor decision-making, and deterioration in planning and control of work); staff attitude and behavior problems (loss of motivation and commitment, burnout, staff working increasingly long hours but for diminishing returns, poor timekeeping, labor turnover); and difficulties with relationships at work (tension and conflicts between colleagues, poor relationships with clients, increase in disciplinary problems).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The development of strategies to address these barriers and limitations that individuals with mental health disorders face once employed are important given the high estimates of unemployment among these workers. Figures for the United States show that between 75 and 85% of people with severe mental illness are unemployed while, in the United Kingdom, estimates range from 61 to 73% (Crowther, Marshall, Bond, &amp; Huxley, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002022">2001a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002023">2001b</CitationRef>). Individuals with less severe disorders still experience a 26% unemployment rate (New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002063">2003</CitationRef>). Depression alone, although underdiagnosed, has been estimated to have a prevalence of approximately 10% among employees (Berndt et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00207">1998</CitationRef>). A growing body of research literature into the effectiveness of work accommodations and employment retention initiatives attests to the need for accommodations. Compounding the challenge of the ­provision of job accommodations in the workplace is the absence of an integrative conceptual model of employment interventions in mental health, and the paucity of solid research evidence informing workplace policies and disability prevention practices for employees with mental health disorders.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A recent series of studies on work accommodation in mental health (Schultz, Duplassie, Hanson, &amp; Winter, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002068">2010</CitationRef>; Schultz, Milner, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002071">2010</CitationRef>; Schultz, Winter, &amp; Wald, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002073">2010</CitationRef>) proposed a broader ecological, person-environment conceptualization of work accommodations.

              <Para TextBreak="No">Work accommodations and interventions for persons with mental health disorders show promise for improving employment outcomes. To be maximally effective, these interventions should be offered in an integrated and multi-systemic manner, as well being consistent with the biopsychosocial model of occupational disability, which postulates the integration of vocational and clinical services and emphasizes the worker’s strengths and abilities rather than psychopathology and diagnosis (Goldner et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002034">2004</CitationRef>; Loisel et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002052">2001</CitationRef>; Schultz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002066">2008</CitationRef>; Schultz et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002072">2007</CitationRef>). Interventions and accommodations for persons with mental health disorders can be conceptualized at the following three system levels: macrosystem interventions, focusing on society, culture, legislation, and policies; employer-level (mesosystem) interventions; and employee-level (microsystem) interventions. The current chapter focuses on macrosystem and mesosystem interventions, as they best inform organizational policy and practice.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00204">
                <Heading>Macrosystem Interventions</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Macrosystem interventions can be defined as large scale interventions that aim to change societal attitudes at large, generally involving legislative, policy, cultural, or systemic changes in both the public and private sectors. Barriers to the employment of persons with mental health disorders best addressed at the macrosystem level include the negative societal attitudes, stigma, fears and lack of knowledge. Negative attitudes, fears and lack of knowledge permeate society and, consequently, inform the expectations held by employers, coworkers, disability compensation and management systems, and society at large. As well, social stigma, thought by some to be more disabling than the primary mental health condition, itself, is a major barrier in the workplace for persons with mental health disorders (Baldwin &amp; Marcus, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00206">2010</CitationRef>; Haslan et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002040">2005</CitationRef>: Wang, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002089">2010</CitationRef>). Indeed, it has been suggested that interventions directed at reducing stigma need to understand how negative attitudes and discrimination operate within specific life domains, such as employment. A recent study by Krupa and colleagues (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002048">2010</CitationRef>), for example, suggested that a range of assumptions about people with mental illness (e.g., competence dangerousness, the legitimacy of mental illness, the impact of work on mental health and work as charity), is particularly salient in the work context, and that the impact of these assumptions depends on the positions of key people holding these assumptions. While ­society-wide public awareness campaigns utilizing a social marketing approach could benefit this field (Schultz, Krupa &amp; Rogers, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002070">2010</CitationRef>), focusing efforts in particular social contexts such as employment may prove particularly fruitful. For example, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Opening Minds Initiative</Emphasis> of the Mental Health Commission of Canada has included the workforce as one of the key foci for anti-stigma initiatives. A key element of this initiative is to include the promising practice of contact-based education (Couture &amp; Penn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002021">2003</CitationRef>), which involves developing opportunities for key stakeholders in the workforce to have meaningful and positive exchanges with people who have lived the experience of mental illness (Mental Health Commission of Canada, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002061">2011</CitationRef>). Another important macrosystem intervention involves <Emphasis Type="Italic">legislative and public policy support</Emphasis> for parity for persons with mental health conditions in health care, insurance, compensation and rehabilitation systems, as well as fairness in employment practices (Baldwin &amp; Marcus, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00206">2010</CitationRef>; Black, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00209">2008</CitationRef>; Center, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002017">2010</CitationRef>; Commission of European Communities, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002019">2008</CitationRef>; Department of Work and Pensions and Department of Health, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002025">2008</CitationRef>; Gallie, Schultz, &amp; Winter, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002030">2010</CitationRef>; Standing Senate Committee, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002080">2006</CitationRef>; World Health Organization, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002094">2005</CitationRef>). In addition, studies of public policy have suggested that policy documents are weakened by inconsistent representations of mental illness, vague descriptions of the functional implications of mental illness, and few concrete and positive examples of work accommodations (Cockburn et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002018">2006</CitationRef>). Developing meaningful legislation and policy related to employment equity and workplace accommodation, as well as processes for promoting employer buy-in, is essential. Stuart (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002084">2006</CitationRef>) noted that research suggests that employer compliance with legislation has been problematic, as demonstrated by the high number of complaints submitted for charges of discrimination based on the <Emphasis Type="Italic">U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act</Emphasis>.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In order to prevent occupational disability in general, a <Emphasis Type="Italic">multisystem interaction</Emphasis>, involving the integration of clinical and vocational rehabilitation services, is essential. There is strong and growing ­evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of integrated clinical and occupational interventions, using a bio­psychosocial model in the field of musculoskeletal pain (Schultz &amp; Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002069">2005</CitationRef>; Schultz, Krupa, &amp; Rogers, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002070">2010</CitationRef>; Schultz et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002072">2007</CitationRef>). Integration of mental health and vocational services has been found effective in enhancing employment retention of persons with mental health disorders (Arthur, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00205">2000</CitationRef>; Berndt et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00207">1998</CitationRef>; Bishop, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00208">2004</CitationRef>; Holzberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002041">2001</CitationRef>; Johnstone, Vessell, Bounds, Hoskins, &amp; Sherman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002042">2003</CitationRef>; Macias, DeCarlo, Wang, Frey, &amp; Barreira, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002057">2001</CitationRef>; Means, Stewart, &amp; Dowler, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002059">1997</CitationRef>; Scheid, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002065">1998</CitationRef>; Sherbourne et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002077">2001</CitationRef>; Smith et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002078">2002</CitationRef>). However, practical implementation of this approach in the workplace has been lagging behind. Moreover, the high profile <Emphasis Type="Italic">Canadian Global Business and Economic Roundtable on Mental Health</Emphasis> (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002032">2005</CitationRef>) highlighted the importance of addressing the occupational stress experienced by employees in workplaces, and the accompanying need to support their intellectual and emotional capacities and thereby meet growing business demands for innovation and global competition. The idea of developing a psychologically safe and healthy workplace has gained traction as the legal basis for protecting employee mental health (Shain, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002076">2009</CitationRef>). Efforts have been directed at identifying key psychosocial risk factors and creating associated tools for workplaces (Shain, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002076">2009</CitationRef>). The Guarding Minds@Work strategy is one such example (<ExternalRef>
                    <RefSource>www.guardingmindsatworks.ca</RefSource>
                    <RefTarget Address="http://www.guardingmindsatworks.ca" TargetType="URL"/>
                  </ExternalRef>). <Emphasis Type="Italic">Guarding Minds</Emphasis> provides employers with strategies and tools to identify and address 12 psychosocial risk factors. Indeed, organizational infrastructure to facilitate communication among various mental health stakeholders is much needed. Involving the health care system, compensation system, employer, union and the worker in reciprocal multisystem interactions, with a common goal of promoting job retention, is essential to effect lasting paradigm changes in attitudes, organizational structure, policy and practices.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Mesosystem interventions can be defined as workplace organization-based interventions focusing on the extent to which the workplace itself can be constructed to facilitate job retention and health. An optimal environment for work accommodations and retention interventions is found in a ­workplace culture that embraces the following: opportunities for control and decision-making; the full utilization of worker capacities and skills; the opportunity for a variety of workplace activities; employee involvement; reasonable and well-integrated job demands; clear and predictable work expectations and conditions; interpersonal contacts; valued social positions in the workplace; and productivity connected to gains and rewards. These all seem to be associated with greater psychosocial benefits for employees (Kirsh &amp; Gewurtz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002043">2010</CitationRef>; Krupa, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002045">2007</CitationRef>; Vézina, Bourbonnais, Brisson, &amp; Trudel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002088">2004</CitationRef>; Warr, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002090">1987</CitationRef>). It should also be noted that employer-level interventions can be divided into Level and Level II interventions. Those interventions focusing on <Emphasis Type="Italic">primary prevention</Emphasis> of occupational disability and disease, and the promotion of health and wellness in the workplace, comprise Level I interventions. Those focusing on <Emphasis Type="Italic">secondary prevention</Emphasis> of occupational disability, including early detection, identification, and intervention with mental health problems in the workplace to prevent or reduce emerging disability, comprise Level II interventions.</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">The cost of a job accommodation provision is a necessary consideration for employers. Thus, it is important to have specific policies regarding the payment and costs of providing these accommodations. While the research in this area is scant, it suggests that costs to employers may not be large out-of-pocket expenses; rather, accommodations in mental health often rely on creative and flexible solutions (MacDonald-Wilson, Rogers, Massaro, Lyass, &amp; Crean, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002055">2002</CitationRef>). Examples include: ­extending additional paid and unpaid leave during a hospitalization or other absence; allowing additional time for workers to reach performance milestones; extending probationary periods; allowing an employee to make phone calls during the day to personal and professional supports; providing a private space in which to make such phone calls; providing a private space to rest or talk to supportive coworkers; allowing an employee to work at home; and allowing workers to consume fluids at their workstation (e.g., due to medication side effects; as cited by Bruyere, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002014">2000</CitationRef>). The costs of such accommodations may be relatively low, but research in this area is needed. For example, a recent study of employers’ experiences of intermittent work capacity in the context of episodic health conditions, such as those associated with mental illness, suggested that providing coverage, (particularly when absences are not anticipated, there is little warning of the absence, or where there are expectations related to return-to-work) can pose significant organizational challenges for workplaces, that may translate into increased costs if ineffectively managed (Lysaght, Krupa, &amp; Gregory, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002053">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>

Ideally, this training would be combined with awareness raising, stigma reduction, and developing the best organizational conditions for a mentally healthy workplace (Gallie et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002030">2010</CitationRef>). Several training and educational programs have recently been developed in response to the need to: address stigma in the workplace; promote early identification of mental illness and early access to treatment; and develop the capacity of the workplace to effectively support people who experience mental illness in the workplace (see for example, Canadian Mental Health Association, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002016">2008</CitationRef>; Canadian Mental Health Association, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002015">2011</CitationRef>).

There are two well-developed and disseminated organizational frameworks for meeting the employment needs of people with mental health disorders. The first, for those already work-attached, is disability management. The second framework is supported employment approaches, generally used for those with more severe mental health disabilities, and those who have had histories of no, or little, labor market attachment for a significant duration of time. Job-employee matching, a human resource strategy designed to enhance employment retention in mental health, could be incorporated into either of these frameworks.</Para>

Typically, such programs involve a single management plan designed to ensure implementation of key disability management practices (Westmorland &amp; Buys, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002092">2002</CitationRef>). By balancing both economic and productivity needs with the sustained health and well-being of the workforce, these approaches can support labor and management relationships (Scully, Habeck, &amp; Leahy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002075">1999</CitationRef>). While promising, this approach is restricted to those already in the workforce. Other noted limitations to disability management programs are the potential lack of sensitivity to the complexity of interactions between an individual’s mental health and organizational practices, as well as employers’ inadequate preparation for dealing with employees with mental health disabilities, and privacy and confidentiality risks.</Para>

The focus is on rapid job placement with “wrap around supports” rather than long periods of training and preparation prior to employment (Anthony &amp; Blanch, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00204">1989</CitationRef>). The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Individual Placement and Support Model</Emphasis> (IPS) is an example of supported employment. The goal of this program is to help individuals with severe mental illness rapidly enter into competitive jobs in the community.

                  <Para TextBreak="No">Negatively held attitudes and fears, often arising from a lack of education, knowledge and awareness among employers, coworkers and individuals with mental health disorders, can act as barriers to implementing job accommodations in the workplace. Not only are many employers lacking in understanding about mental health symptoms and their impact on work performance, they are also minimally aware of accommodation needs of employees with mental health conditions and what accommodation options exist (Schultz, Milner, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002071">2010</CitationRef>). It is imperative to recognize organizational, policy and resource-related challenges that exist at the employer level. Systemic and contextual factors that limit employers’ willingness and ability to implement such initiatives are behind most barriers to job accommodations. Research suggests that size of company and type of industry are key factors in whether employers provide job accommodations (Schultz, Milner, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002071">2010</CitationRef>). Due to greater financial and structural resources, larger companies (as compared to small and mid-size companies) have the ability to offer such services and, as a result, more often have established policies regarding hiring persons with mental health disabilities and offering job accommodations. Furthermore, the use of job accommodations tends to be predicted by the existence of a company policy about hiring individuals with disabilities. Findings from Schultz and colleagues (Schultz, Duplassie, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002068">2010</CitationRef>; Schultz, Milner, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002071">2010</CitationRef>) indicate that systemic limitations faced by employers are key barriers to provision of these services, even more critical than holding positive attitudes and a willingness to hire persons with mental health disorders.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">An employer’s sole reliance on a narrow understanding of the disability management model is also of concern. Under this model, the necessity of coordination of services with direct intervention with the employee may be lost. Likewise, recognition of the clinical and psychosocial complexities of the workplace may not be sufficient. Similarly, excessive reliance on traditional external Employee Assistance Programs for counseling is problematic due to the absence of occupational interventions with attention to system-related factors (Gallie et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002030">2010</CitationRef>). Often of concern is the fact that effective relationship-based accommodations, including natural supports in the workplace (e.g., using coworkers), are often under-utilized by employers. Recent research has suggested that workplace support from coworkers, supervisors and others on the job is associated with the existence of positive relations between workers, and the sense that the worker requiring accommodations is committed to the goals of the workplace (Lysaght et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002053">2011</CitationRef>). Where there is existing unresolved conflict between workers, support for accommodation and job retention is compromised (Williams-Whitt &amp; Taras, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002093">2010</CitationRef>). Employers also seem least aware of job accommodations for persons with mental health disorders that require flexibility in redesigning or reorganizing work processes (e.g., working from home, job sharing, establishing distraction-free work space and the appropriate use of work scheduling and breaks; Schultz, Winter, &amp; Wald, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002073">2010</CitationRef>). Workplaces that have strong leadership to support inclusive work practices, and communication structures that promote information sharing about workplace accommodations and local problem solving, offer an organizational culture of practice that enables flexibility in the design of work processes that balance the accommodation needs of workers with the ­productivity goals of the employer (Krupa &amp; Lysaght, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002049">2011</CitationRef>)</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Research to validate various interventions and accommodations in mental health is in its early stages, and emphasis should be placed on those interventions and accommodations that have the best ­evidentiary support to date. Nonetheless, a range of useful “best practices” have emerged from a research literature synthesis (Schultz, Winter, &amp; Wald, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002073">2010</CitationRef>), expert interviews (Schultz, Duplassie, et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR002068">2010</CitationRef>), and an employer survey (Schultz, Milner, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002071">2010</CitationRef>). The following interventions and accommodations have been suggested by the research to be useful in ameliorating the social, ­emotional or cognitive limitations associated with mental health conditions:

              <Para TextBreak="No">The design, implementation and evaluation of job accommodations and interventions for persons with mental health problems are more complex and multidimensional than the development of analogous interventions and job accommodations for persons with physical limitations. Such interventions are evolving from legislative, policy, attitudinal, employer and disability stakeholder perspectives, as well as from a research perspective. Despite the compilation of a seemingly comprehensive list of job accommodations by the US Department of Labor Job Accommodation Network (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002086">2007</CitationRef>), research and evidentiary support for most accommodations is just emerging. Even though there is considerable stigma surrounding mental health conditions, employers’ awareness of job accommodations depends less on their attitudes and more on the size of the company, the existence of written policies in regards to accommodations, and prior experience in hiring a person with mental health disability (Schultz, Milner, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002071">2010</CitationRef>). Solutions to the problem of poor awareness and under-utilization of job accommodations are multi-systemic and multi-layered, involving the need for a significant paradigm shift, among the key stakeholders, in conceptualizing and accommodating mental health problems in the workplace.</Para>

Moreover, multivariate and multilevel analysis models are underutilized. In addition, the effectiveness of accommodations is likely dependent on the type and stability of functional work limitations, timing of interventions, consistency of application, a variety of employer-related and coworker-related support factors, as well as task demands and worker control over the work tasks. Such conditions and factors demand difficult, labor-intensive, and costly-to-execute research designs.

A new research paradigm for mental health disabilities in the workplace, integrating multisystem research with combined clinical and occupational approaches, is needed. Only by integrating the efforts of researchers, policy-makers, health-care practitioners, employers, educators, disability compensation systems, and persons with mental health disorders can the challenge of mental health in the workplace be addressed.</Para>
