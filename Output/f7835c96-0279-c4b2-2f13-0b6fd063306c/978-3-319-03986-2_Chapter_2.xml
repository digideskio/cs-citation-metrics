This chapter proceeds to discuss the features of a disease and the specific realities of illness by showing the difference between the two concepts. Disease and illness categories (acute, chronic, accidents/injuries, and mental disease/illness) are discussed. The chapter concludes with a strong emphasis on the cultural beliefs regarding illness causation among lay populations, especially in the African context. The natural, supernatural, mystical, and hereditary/genetic causations are discussed based on cultural realities but are sometimes divergent from biomedical models of disease causation.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">There has not been an absolute consensus on the definitions of health, disease, and illness, even though these concepts are central not only in medicine but also in the health social sciences<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Social sciences</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> (e.g., medical sociology, health psychology and medical demography). These are parts of the conceptual tools in various medical-related fields. A definition of each concept is imperative because they constitute parts of the analytical tools in medical sociology. The lack of consensus often prevents uniformity of interpretations and generates more polemics. One wonders why there has not been consensus, despite the long history of medicine. The concepts are multidimensional, complex, and often elusive. For instance, Larson (<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">1999</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Larson, J.S.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> observed that disagreements about the meaning of health are common because health is imbued with political, medical, social, economic, and spiritual components. It is subject to various conceptualisation and interpretations. While all the concepts have their foundations in medicine, a biomedical perspective of health or disease may not be comprehensive enough. However, a fusion of the various perspectives often presents a complex definition like the WHO’s definition of health<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Health</Primary>
              <Secondary>definition</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm>. This is why the debate on the definition of health is still ongoing. That the debate continues is not a problem as refinement of definition could lead to a better conceptualisation.</Para>

          <Heading>How Should Health be Defined?</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The concept of health presents a form of ambiguity because it is multidimensional, complex, and sometimes elusive. Notwithstanding, various scholars, apart from the definition given by the WHO, have defined the concept. Although it is not the first definition of health, the WHO’s definition will still be the starting point because it is relatively old and has been central to the debate on the meaning of health. WHO (<CitationRef CitationID="CR40">1948</CitationRef>) defined health as<Emphasis Type="Italic"> a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease and infirmity</Emphasis>. The definition is holistic, and it presents three major interrelated components of health (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">2.1</InternalRef>).</Para>

This is often used to infer a soundness of the body. Most often, disease represents a malfunction of a part of the body system or an intrusion of harmful organisms such as a virus or parasite. This may cause a breakdown of the individual affected. This physiological aspect is the most important biomedical criterion in the determination of health. For someone to be healthy, his/her biological components must be in order. A major diagnosis procedure involves a determination of what could be wrong with any component of the body or detection of any intrusion of any anti-body by tracing the pathways of the disease from underlying causes to pathology in the human body system and examination of any emerging of symptoms. Determining this may involve a series of laboratory tests or clinical examinations. One may be certified as healthy if there is no detection of any biological hitch.</Para>

              <Primary>Awofeso, N.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> observed that the definition is inflexible and unrealistic. He claimed that the inclusion of the word “complete” in the definition makes it unlikely for anyone to be healthy for a reasonable period of time. Godlee (<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Godlee, F.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> also noted that the definition is absolute and therefore unachievable for most people in the world. The definition presents an absolute ideal situation by combining the three aspects of human life. It is often difficult, if not impossible, to gain complete contentment in all the aspects. It is observed that since health is a goal, not only of the health care system but also individual and the society at large, it is ideal for a body like WHO to present a realistic definition that can be operationalised and achievable (Godlee <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Godlee, F.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In addition, Saracci (<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">1997</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Saracci, R.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> also submitted that the WHO’s definition of health is problematic and it should be reconsidered. Saracci observed that the definition equates health with happiness—that a disruption of happiness could be regarded as a health problem. He further argued that the WHO’s definition reflects that health is boundless. More so, Huber et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2011</CitationRef>, p. 2)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Huber, M.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> opined that the WHO’s definition is problematic because it impliedly declares people with chronic diseases and disabilities definitively ill. The definition further minimises “the role of the human capacity to cope autonomously with life’s ever changing physical, emotional, and social challenges and to function with fulfilment and a feeling of wellbeing with a chronic disease or disability” (Huber et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2011</CitationRef>, p. 2)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Huber, M.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Despite several decades of criticisms, the WHO has not reviewed the definition. The idea of a definition is to present a holistic view that is meaningful not only for individuals but also as a (definitive) tool in scientific investigation. The idea is not to advance an operational perfection that is unchangeable. Perhaps, there is yet a review because there has not been a more holistic and measurable alternative definition of health. The question is simple: are other definitions of “health” more operational?</Para>

        <Section1 ID="Sec3">
          <Heading>A New Definition of Health?</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Several other scholars have proposed other definitions of health<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Health</Primary>
              <Secondary>definition</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm>, which can be used in light of changing global health circumstances. Some of these definitions will be critically examined; however, the essence of examining other definitions is not to defend the WHO’s definition or to render such alternative definitions as immaterial. After some strictures of WHO’s definition of health by Saracci (<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">1997</CitationRef>, p. 1410)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Saracci, R.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, he proposed a definition of health as “a condition of wellbeing, free of disease or infirmity, and a basic and universal human right.” Impliedly, this definition also defined those who are living positively with chronic disease as unhealthy. It presents a health as a basic right, which is also problematic. In most parts of the world, health is a commodity with an insurance premium, a price-tag, or it requires a pool from the public tax. This also seems like a theoretical proposition that is not operational. It does not really account for the multidimensionality of health. Therefore, it may not be considered a holistic and viable alternative to the WHO definition.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Bircher (<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2005</CitationRef>, p. 1)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Bircher, J.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, on the other hand, defines health as “a dynamic state of well-being characterised by a physical and mental potential, which satisfies the demands of life commensurate with age, culture, and personal responsibility.” While this is stylishly holistic, it is contentious due to the use of other concepts (e.g., age and culture) without unified definitions. For instance, culture is complex, dynamic, and relative. This may imply that the definition of health<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Health</Primary>
              <Secondary>definition</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm> will also be relative and probably depend on the circumstances or societies. Additionally, does the definition refer to biological age or social construction of age? This is part of the complicatedness as the concepts used are not specific.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In an attempt to proffer a more acceptable perspective in the face of the continuous debate, Larson (<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">1999</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Larson, J.S.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> proposed that health should be conceived using multiple models: medical, the WHO, wellness, and environmental models. A combination of these models will be more holistic beyond the use of only the WHO model or other definitions. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">2.1</InternalRef> presents the models of defining health. One major problem with model-based definition is that there could be more models than expected. The model-approach does not present a whole definition. Later, every profession will likely present a model of health beyond common understanding, and this will generate more issues. The major strength of this approach is that it emphases the multifactorial context of the concept of health.</Para>

              <Primary>Parsons, T.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. This is more a sociological approach to health—a conceptualisation of health as a social element. Health in this sociological sense is more inclined towards human capacity to fulfil their obligations, participate in social activities (including work), and fulfil role expectations in the society in the face of structural limitations. This conception is connected with both physiological and mental models of health in the sense that the source of a social incapacitation could be from a biological or mental limitation. The social model does not debunk the biomedical model. The model is complementary to the medical model and signifies a perspective that is central in medical sociology<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm> defined health as <Emphasis Type="Italic">the ability to adapt and self-manage in the face of social, physical, and emotional challenges</Emphasis>. This definition was initially proposed in 2008 (see Jadad and O’Grady <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2008</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Primary>O’Grady, L.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. The definition seems to be receiving some considerations, especially because of the use of “adaptation.” While the WHO’s definition stresses on <Emphasis Type="Italic">a complete state</Emphasis>, this definition proposes <Emphasis Type="Italic">adaptive capacity</Emphasis>. Lancet Editorial (<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">2009</CitationRef>, p. 781) commented, “Health is an elusive as well as a motivating idea. By replacing perfection with adaptation, we get closer to a more compassionate, comforting, and creative programme for medicine—one to which we can all contribute.” The major strength of this definition is that it takes account of the shift in health challenges in the twenty-first century. Unlike the period before World War II when acute diseases were more prevalent than chronic diseases, now the latter constitutes a greater burden. Chronic diseases require behavioural adjustments in terms of self-care or management (see Sects. <InternalRef RefID="Sec8">2.6.2</InternalRef> and <ExternalRef>
              <RefSource>8.3</RefSource>

). This is why the idea of adaptation seems to be more current than that of “a complete state.”</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">With a critical stance, the definition by Huber et al. is also problematic. First, adaptation does not mean the absence of diseases or infirmity. Adaptation may signify a number of limitations such food or activity restrictions or behavioural constraints. Second, it may also mean continuous treatment or dependence on medication. In the case of a chronic disease, adaptation does not nullify the self-awareness of (undesirable) state of health. The shortcomings of the definition also create opportunities for more deliberations.</Para>

              <Primary>Blaxter, M.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is the lay concept of health. This implies how different individuals define health, which explains the relativity of the concept. The lay concept of health is essentially subjective because it is based on people’s own assessment and judgment of whether they are healthy or not. Blaxter (<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">1990</CitationRef>, p. 40)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Blaxter, M.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> observed that the most “usual way of measuring self-perceived illness, as distinct from the presence or absence of disease, is by means of symptom lists.” To the lay population, absence of symptoms means health. From this perspective, Blaxter (<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">1990</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Blaxter, M.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> identified the three “states” of health: freedom from illness, ability to function, and fitness. In this regards, health is also perceived as energy and vitality in terms of fitness for functions: physical, social and normative activities<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm> argued that health could be defined, constructed, experienced, acted out, and it is also dynamic. Definitions of health are often for operational use like the previous definitions that have been considered. Construction of health stems from the lay perspective or individual’s appraisal of state of health, which can be good or bad. Such construction also includes what a particular society qualifies as “health.” For instance, labelling<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Labelling</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> reactivity (people’s reaction to a particular condition) might influence designation or conceptualisation of health or illness in a particular society (see sect. <ExternalRef>

for labeling theory). Experiential knowledge of health is phenomenological—derived from feeling of wellness or otherwise, which emanate from the presence or absence of personal discomfort and pain. In terms of “enactment” of health, the central consideration includes what people do to maintain their health. Health is also a dynamic attribute because it fluctuates across biographical, historical and contextual milieus. The state of health varies across lifespan, and is influenced by a number of factors including personal (e.g., lifestyle) and structural factors (e.g., access to health care) (see Chapter four). The conceptualisation of disease will be the focus of next section.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Health has been conceived in a biomedical model as the absence of disease while the holistic definition from the WHO signifies that health is not a mere absence of disease. Whichever form the definition takes, the question now is “what constitutes a disease?” One major issue is that disease is often conceived from a biomedical point of view. It can also have behavioural manifestations, especially with regard to human functionality. The definition of health<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Health</Primary>
              <Secondary>definition</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm> is complex, so also is the definition of a disease. If the lack of health can be defined as not a mere absence of a disease or infirmity, this signifies that there are a number of germ- and non-germ-related (medical) conditions that can signify the presence of a disease. This, however, also makes the definition of a disease complex because of variations in its conceptions. Mainly, Boorse (<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">1975</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">1977</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Boorse, C.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> was engrossed in a practical and philosophical discussion of what health and disease may entail. He defined disease as a type of internal state which impairs health (i.e., reduces one or more functional ability below typical efficiency). One major criticism of this definition is the use of “typical efficiency,” which implies the presence of a reference group in the definition of disease (Kingma <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">2007</CitationRef>; Stempsey <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">2000</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Kingma, E.</Primary>

            </IndexTerm> as a kind of comparative analysis. This view is often referred to as a bio-statistical theory (BST)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Bio-statistical theory (BST)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> of health and disease. Kingma (<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">2007</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Kingma, E.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> argued that human species are different in functional capacity: what is normal in one group can be abnormal in another and vice versa. Therefore, Boorse’s definition of health or disease is only valid depending on the reference group.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Despite this criticism, Boorse’s arguments have been a significant reference point in the discussion of health and diseases. Boorse discussed seven major themes that are prominent in the discussion of what health or a disease entails. It is important here to examine the seven themes in line with the notion of disease and see how important or otherwise those themes could be in identifying a disease.</Para>

              <Primary>Temple, L.K.F.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> proposed a definition of disease with three basic elements—“disease is <Emphasis Type="Italic">a state</Emphasis> that places individuals at <Emphasis Type="Italic">increased risk</Emphasis> of <Emphasis Type="Italic">adverse consequences</Emphasis>.” The first element, “a state,” implies a physiological or psycho-social condition which explains susceptibility to risk. Second, risk includes the possibility of impairment. Certain conditions put individuals at a risk of diseases in the future. Therefore, both preventive and therapeutic measures could be provided to avert or ameliorate adverse consequences or undesirable situations. Meanwhile, adverse consequences include morbidity, disability, or mortality. The definition adequately extends to genetic conditions in humans.</Para>

              <Primary>Obesity</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. In the pre-industrial era, obesity was a sign of affluence and good living, while in the modern era it is a disease with enormous research and development of medical interventions (including surgical procedures) to “cure” obesity. Apart from the medical risks of obesity, the social and modern reconstruction of beauty as a slim body figure also affects attitudes towards obesity.

            </IndexTerm>. More importantly, sociologists have laid more claims on the notion of illness because it is more of a behavioural concept than a medical one. Undoubtedly, illness has a number of undeniable social, moral, and legal contexts.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In a simple illustration, disease is a form of pathology or medical problem, defect, or impairment, while illness is a manifestation of such an impairment, defect/pathology, or disability. Illness is a presentation of a medical condition in a way that limits the functional capability of an individual in the society. This is why Nordenfeldt (<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">1993</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Nordenfeldt, L.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> observed that to be ill is to be in pain, to be anxious, or to be disabled. The notion of illness fits appropriately into the concept of sick role<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Sick role</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> described by Parsons (1951). It is a situation when an individual consciously feels that he/she is unhealthy, sometimes as a result of discomfort and pain. Therefore, illness is the <Emphasis Type="Italic">live-experience of a diseased condition</Emphasis>. While a diseased patient might not <Emphasis Type="Italic">be real</Emphasis> (i.e., without a self-awareness of the condition), an ill patient is real.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It can simply be observed that <Emphasis Type="Italic">disease makes people ill</Emphasis>. An individual is thus ill to some degree if there is some vital goal of his/her which cannot be completely realised (Nordenfeldt <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">1993</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Nordenfeldt, L.</Primary>

            <Heading>Mental Disease/Illness</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Mental health simply refers to the level of psychological well-being of an individual. This often has to do with the brain vis-à-vis thought, feelings, sensation, and intuition. About 14 % of the global burden of disease has been attributed to neuropsychiatric disorders (Prince et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2007</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Prince, M.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Mental problems frequently manifest with behavioural changes that represent an infraction on the social norms of the society. A mental disorder is socially disastrous to the individual and could lead to total incapacitation or exemption from normal roles in the society. There are two major divisions of mental illness, which include neurosis<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Neurosis</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> (minor) and psychosis (major). While the former does not usually involve organic (brain) breakdown, the latter usually does. Examples of neurosis include: obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, phobia, dissociative disorder, minor depression, hypochondria, hysteria, and puerperal neurosis. Psychosis<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Psychosis</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> involves loss of contact with reality. It is generally the worst form of mental disorder. Examples of psychosis include bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, substance-induced mental disorder, dementia<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Dementia</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> (Alzheimer), delusional disorder, and epilepsy. A mental disorder may not necessarily lead to death, but it is disabling—it could be acute or chronic. Sartorius (<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">2007</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Irrespective of value judgment about such beliefs, the realities of such beliefs cannot be debunked, so also the realities of such causal connections. It is often the case for scientists to consider some local beliefs about causality implausible, inexplicit, and inconsiderable in scientific explanations. However, local beliefs are relevant in understanding the population health and in drawing behavioural interventions. Sometimes, such beliefs are misconceptions, which need to be addressed. Specifically, disease causation is often divided into four types: natural, supernatural, mystical, and hereditary/genetic.</Para>

It is further observed that it is made use of at a point where ordinary empirical methods of treatment and explanation have failed. This typically deals with divine attribution of illness. With the emergence of modern religions, such as Christianity<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Especially among most religious adherents, there is a fatalistic belief that disease or health comes from God.
