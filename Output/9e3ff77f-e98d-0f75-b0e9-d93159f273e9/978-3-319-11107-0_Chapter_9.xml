            <Para ID="Par2" TextBreak="No">The definition of what it means to be an effective surgical leader has changed. In the not-so-distant past, surgical leadership was synonymous with an autocratic, command and control style. This approach to leadership, which dominated for many years, often gave surgeons a bad reputation. Surgeons were often perceived as inflexible, tyrannical, and not “team players”. There are clear advantages to the autocratic style (which are covered in other chapters in more detail), including getting things done quickly and strategically, which can be important when delivering surgical care.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par3" TextBreak="No">However, the autocratic style of leadership is NOT the most effective way to lead a team [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. The need to work in teams, and the collective intolerance of leaders who cannot work as part of a team, has banished most of those with the autocratic leadership style to the dark corners of most health systems. At best, the inability to work with a team severely limits one’s leadership opportunities. At the worst, the inability to work with a team results in remediation, such as anger management, professional coaching, or even dismissal.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par4" TextBreak="No">Teamwork has never been more important in the delivery of surgical care. Most clinical care is delivered by a multidisciplinary team of providers (e.g., breast cancer, bariatric surgery, transplant surgery). Quality improvement work can only be done by engaging all front line staff (e.g., nurses, physicians, other providers) in a meaningful way. For surgeon-scientists, leading a team of researchers that bridges clinical and methodological disciplines is the only way to elevate your work to the level of sophistication that merits external funding in a very competitive environment.</Para>

            <Heading>Learning New Mental Models</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par5" TextBreak="No">Becoming a better leader often involves learning new mental models. Mental models are a useful way to make sense of complexity. In medical school, we spend many years learning mental models for various biological processes (e.g., trans-membrane receptors, T-cell receptors, etc.…). These biological processes are no doubt much more complicated than the representations that appear in colored bubble diagrams in our textbooks. Nonetheless, it is widely accepted that this “working understanding” that comes from these mental models allows us to use this knowledge to benefit our patients, e.g., develop new medical treatments that can then be empirically tested.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par6" TextBreak="No">In medical school and residency, we spend very little time developing mental models for understanding human behavior. A typical, but very simple, mental model that may be familiar to anyone who completed a surgical residency is “strong vs. weak”. These simple mental models create a false dichotomy that can often be represented by proverbs, e.g., “actions speak louder than words”. Leadership by proverbs is flawed, however, since every proverb has an opposite but equally correct proverb. For example, the opposite of “actions speak louder than words” is “the pen is mightier than the sword” (see <ExternalRef>
                <RefSource>http://www.rinkworks.com/words/proverbs.shtml</RefSource>
                <RefTarget Address="http://www.rinkworks.com/words/proverbs.shtml" TargetType="URL"/>
              </ExternalRef> for a comprehensive list).</Para>
            <Para ID="Par7" TextBreak="No">Leadership development is about learning more sophisticated mental models. As the Associate Chair for Faculty Development in our Department, I conduct an 8-month Leadership Development Program (LDP). Many cynics often ask, “What can you possibly learn from such a program that helps you become a better leader?”. Although our data suggest there are many benefits, I believe the exposure to and learning new mental models is an essential component. In our program, we introduce mental models for leading change, working in teams, encouraging innovation, and many others. Combined with action-based learning projects, which provide an opportunity to try out and reflect on these new mental models, these programs can be powerful development experiences.</Para>

            <Heading>How to Motivate Your Team</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par9" TextBreak="No">The science of motivating teams is fascinating because there is a HUGE gap between what the best scientific work shows and what we actually do in practice. In his book “Drive” Daniel Pink nicely reviews the scientific evidence behind motivating individuals at work [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. The most common practice for motivating individuals is to pay for performance. If a leader wants more of a behavior, she will create financial incentives that reinforce that behavior. Unfortunately, the science tells us that this often does not work. Motivating with “carrots and sticks” does work but only for a narrow range of behaviors. The tasks for which incentives are appropriate are for simple, mechanical tasks where effort easily translates into productivity. However, in the current environment, where most tasks are cognitively complex and require innovative solutions, financial incentives do not work well, and can even compromise performance.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par10" TextBreak="No">Numerous rigorous experiments on the psychology of motivation have found that monetary incentives do not work for cognitively complex tasks [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. On reflection, these empirical findings are consistent with the challenges confronted by many surgical leaders, particularly in academic health centers. Motivating surgeons to be clinically productive is relatively straightforward. Offering large financial incentives – i.e., “eat what you kill” reimbursement models – predictably results in larger amounts of clinical revenue. However, other activities, such as academic output (e.g., grants and publications) are much harder to incentivize.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par11" TextBreak="No">But there is good news: the science of motivation does provide a useful mental model for optimally motivating individuals on a team. There are three essential things that drive successful individuals: autonomy, mastery, and purpose [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. <UnorderedList Mark="Bullet">

            </Para>
            <Para ID="Par15" TextBreak="No">Providing team members with a sense of autonomy is essential. Human nature dictates that individuals are more effective when they chose their own direction. Practically speaking, this means making sure the team members want to be involved in a given activity or committee. When teams are made up of individuals who were assigned by someone else (i.e., did not choose to be there) they may have no sense of “buy in”. As a result, they are much less likely to be effective on that team. Autonomy is not simply about control, however. Having a sense of control is important, but autonomy is more than simply choosing our own path. Matching individual team member’s interests to their assigned tasks is critical. Of course, this means knowing what their interests are. A good leader will have a sense for what each team member’s individual goals and interests are and if their goals and interests match the tasks accordingly. The best team leaders will have a running inventory of where each team member is hoping to grow, and therefore what they may want to get out of an experience.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par16" TextBreak="No">Autonomy and mastery go hand in hand. As we discussed above, allowing team members to develop mastery over a skill set that matters to them is extremely important. The need to develop mastery—doing something over and over again until it comes easy—is one of the greatest drivers of human performance [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. This is important in and of itself by giving us a sense of accomplishment. Mastery is the cornerstone of intrinsic motivation. This is apparent if you reflect on the zeal with which we all pursue our hobbies. But mastery of specific areas is also important for helping us achieve our professional goals. Once again, the team leader must appreciate the needs of the team members. A good leader has insight into which skills each individual is hoping to develop. A leader will also know what that individual’s career goals are and will therefore know which growth opportunities will best help them achieve their individual goals. In a well-designed team, each member fulfills a role that will help them move toward mastery of something that is important to them.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par17" TextBreak="No">The final key is to motivate your team to some higher purpose. Autonomy and mastery are important in and of themselves but work best when used to fulfill a purpose that moves us towards our vision. In surgery, and medicine, this is very easy. We all chose to become physicians because of this higher purpose – to help others. But sometimes we become distracted and take this mission for granted. Sometimes we just lose sight of the big picture. With expansion of new clinical service lines, we often talk about return on investment. When establishing new research centers, we talk about the papers and grants we will write. While this focus on the profit motive is prudent – “no margin, no mission” – it can be disheartening and lead to cynicism in the team. Framing these issues around serving some higher purpose –“no mission, no need for margin”—can connect these efforts to the true purpose, such as public benefits of new clinical programs, or the far-reaching impact of new research initiatives.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par18" TextBreak="No">Communication is essential in establishing the higher purpose of an initiative. Practically speaking, this communication needs to be part of every meeting. Sharing the potential contribution that comes from achieving a shared vision needs to be communicated frequently. Often, teams and committees get caught up in the day-to-day work and forget the goals of their work. Starting each meeting by reviewing the long-term and short-term goals (e.g., of this meeting itself) is a way to ensure such ongoing communication.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par19" TextBreak="No">This mental model stands in stark contrast to how we often think about assigning work as a leader: Delegation. Advice on leadership invariably includes the suggestion that leaders must effectively delegate in order to “leverage their talent” and become more efficient. Unfortunately, effective delegation is more complicated than this one-sided calculus suggests. The delegation must be a win/win scenario for the leaders and the individual or team being delegated to. The autonomy, mastery, and purpose mental model helps sort out whether a leader is delegating or simply dumping. The autonomy can be assessed by asking “Is this a task that the team members would choose for themselves?”; mastery can be assessed by asking “Will this project help the team members develop new skills that are in line with their goals?”; and purpose can be assessed by asking “Does this project clearly reflect the higher purpose of our organization in a way that is meaningful to the team members?”.</Para>

Important tasks are those that best support the longer-term vision of the organization. Developing that vision and strategy are considered elsewhere in this book. Here we assume that these long-term goals are already known. Moreover, choosing the initiatives that are necessary to achieving this vision—i.e., tactical and strategic goals—are considered elsewhere in this book. This next mental model is about making sure these important goals get prioritized appropriately in the midst of the team’s daily work.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par23" TextBreak="No">Prioritizing work to achieve the long-term goals of an organization is an essential part of leading a team. A lot has been written about prioritizing work, but the most widely cited mental model is Steven Covey’s classic two-by-two table, which is sometimes referred to the Eisenhower Matrix (see the quote above) or the Urgent/Importance Matrix [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. This mental model considers two essential attributes of a team’s work, whether it is important (vs. unimportant) or urgent (vs. non-urgent) (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">9.1</InternalRef>). <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

              </Para>
              <Para ID="Par27" TextBreak="No">These two attributes placed in a two-by-two table create four quadrants (I-IV). To prioritize a team’s work, the leader needs to be constantly evaluating which quadrant the team is working in. Quadrant IV represents those tasks that are non-urgent and not important (i.e., distractions). Examples of distractions are the lengthy discussions about last weekend’s football game, many of the phone calls and emails that we receive, or “checking” Facebook. Clearly team member’s time should not be spent in this quadrant. Similarly, quadrant III represents issues that are not-important but are perceived as urgent (i.e., interruptions). Many teams may spend a good deal of time on both distractions and interruptions. A good team leader will recognize when this is occurring and reprioritize and reorient the team’s work.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par28" TextBreak="No">While the distinction between what is urgent and what is not urgent may be straightforward, it is more difficult to identify what is truly important for the team. As discussed elsewhere in this book, the ability to understand which tasks are most important relies on knowledge of the desired future state the team is working towards—i.e., the vision for the organization. Quadrant I tasks include the important, urgent work and represents where most of us spend our time, i.e. “putting out fires”. These tasks are by definition important to the team and aligned with the vision of the larger organization. For a surgeon, quadrant I tasks obviously include unplanned clinical care, such as reoperations for complications. These are clearly important and immediately shift all other priorities—no matter what they are—to the back burner. Dealing with complications falls under our very important long-term goal of being a good doctor. But it should be recognized that if most of the time is spent in this quadrant, less attention is spent on the tasks that support our most important longer-term goals (quadrant II).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par29" TextBreak="No">Good strategies for limiting quadrant I activities are essential. Of course, any practicing surgeon cannot completely eliminate unplanned clinical care. But it can be limited with a more controlled clinical practice, either by having scheduled shifts of clinical activity (e.g., trauma or acute care surgery) or by having a lower morbidity elective practice (e.g., minimally invasive surgery). Perhaps this is why many surgeons slow down their clinical practice, either the volume or the complexity, when they take on administrative roles where they bear more responsibility for long-term goals (e.g., chief medical officer, department chair, etc.…). A leader would not be very effective if they were missing all of their important meetings or did not have the necessary cognitive energy to address the complex problems that come with such roles. Recognition and explicit consideration of this trade-off is important for every leader.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par30" TextBreak="No">It is also important to recognize that not all quadrant I activity is not unplanned clinical care. There are numerous administrative “fires” that need putting out. These require time and attention but may not be explicitly tied to achieving our vision. The key strategy for addressing these is prevention. Chances are that many of the quadrant I activities could be eliminated by carefully focusing on quadrant II activities. We can likely prevent many of these crises by developing our productive capacity and paying daily attention to our long-term goals. Personality conflicts among team members are a frequently occurring example. Identifying and addressing these potential conflicts early, through team building and relationship building, can keep the team focused on quadrant II tasks.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par31" TextBreak="No">Most of our teams need to spend more time in quadrant II, completing the non-urgent but important tasks. Stephen Covey calls this “<Emphasis Type="Italic">putting first things first</Emphasis>” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. These tasks usually represent two key domains. First, they represent tactical and strategic goals of the organizations. These tasks answer this important question: “What things if done differently would allow us to achieve our vision?” Second, these tasks represent ways to build our production capacity. They answer this important question: “What things if done differently would allow our team members to grow in a way that improves their productivity?”. While the former group of activities may be obvious, the second are often not. A classic example of overlooking the investment in production capacity that is highly relevant to this book is leadership development. This short sightedness is captured in the following exchange: <UnorderedList Mark="None">

              <Para ID="Par34" TextBreak="No">If we honestly reflect on how we lead teams, we probably spend more time than we should addressing emergencies and don’t spend enough time working towards our most important organizational goals. Dealing with emergencies has a gravitational pull, especially for surgeons. We chose our specialty because we all crave immediate gratification. We live for small, bite size, fixable problems. Achieving long-term goals requires us to break the pull of these activities. Determining the future direction of an organization – setting the vision – is a key skill in leadership, but prioritizing your team’s work to achieve these goals is just as important.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par35" TextBreak="No">It is important to recognize that as humans we do enjoy interacting with each other in social ways. And this is not a bad thing. Indeed, many of these Quadrant III and IV distractions could actually be filed under “building relationships” among co-workers. These social ties create empathy among team members and enhance our sense of fun at work. This justifies many of the game rooms and fun spaces that characterize many modern offices. Only the completely rational and super-efficient <Emphasis Type="Italic">homo economicus</Emphasis> would edit out all of these interactions. If we reflect for a minute, I am sure someone comes to mind for all of us. Is that person a good leader? Probably not as good as they think they are. But this is clearly a fuzzy line and a zone of high rationalization, where we can justify excessive chattiness and Facebook indulgence. A good team leader can help bring this line into better focus. This line is clearly crossed when distractions and interruptions get in the way of the organization’s goals.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par36" TextBreak="No">Leading teams effectively has never been more important for surgeons. Providing multidisciplinary clinical care, building collaborative research efforts, and engaging front-line personnel to address quality problems all rely on top-notch team leadership. Learning to effectively motivate and prioritize the work of a team are among the most important team leadership mental models. The science of motivation provides a useful mental model for optimally motivating individuals on a team, ensuring each team member has a sense of autonomy, mastery, and purpose. The Urgent/Importance Matrix provides a useful framework for prioritizing teamwork, reminding us to eliminate distractions and interruptions and spend enough time on non-urgent important tasks that help us achieve our long term goals.</Para>
