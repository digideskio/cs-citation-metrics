              <Para>We studied the excitation transfer in double quantum wells of a diluted magnetic semiconductor using a scanning near-field optical microscope at 7 K in external magnetic fields up to 9 T. In each quantum well, local energy minima are generated by local fluctuation of layer thickness and doping concentration of magnetic components. Excitons relax into the local energy minima and transfer between the minima via near-field optical interactions even across quantum wells toward stable sites at which to localize. We measured the intensity maps of near-field photoluminescence with spatial resolution estimated to be 30 nm under varying external magnetic fields. The measurement position reproducibility was confirmed by scanning tunneling microscope images. Analysis of the maps derived the magnetic-field dependence of the typical size of exciton-localization sites for each quantum well. Based on these results, we investigated the excitation transfer between the two quantum wells lying in different layers of the double quantum well system, and showed that the exciton transfer takes place at the two specific applied magnetic-field intensities that result in the crossing of Zeeman-split energy levels of the two different wells. We concluded that both the localization and the inter-quantum-well transfer of excitons are able to be controlled by an external magnetic field. This provides the basis for functional devices operating without any wiring.</Para>

              <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
              <Para>The understanding and application of excitation transfer between nanometer-scale electronic structures via near-field optical interactions is essential for investigating the physical properties of semiconductors in nanometer scale and also for overcoming the limitation of conventional electronic devices [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Here we propose and demonstrate a nano-optoelectronic device that is a system exerting a function based on the coupling of an electronic transport system and near-field optical interaction between isolated electronic systems in sub-wavelength scale. We use the local minima in quantum wells determined with local fluctuation of layer thickness and doping concentration of diluted magnetic components as the basic construction of nano-optoelectronic devices. Excitons relax into the local minima and transfer between the minima via near-field optical interactions toward stable sites. The complexity featured by the optoelectronic coupling is enhanced by layering a number of quantum wells. The complexity of layered quantum wells is multiplied by the near-field optical interactions with hierarchical properties over a range of ten to several hundred nm across the quantum wells. The excitation transfer in the layered quantum wells is very promising for fundamental processes of novel nanofunctional devices beyond wired electronic devices [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. Further, the control of the electronic system with an external electromagnetic field gives the device a distinct advantage of complexity. In order to avoid wiring problems, we use a diluted magnetic semiconductor to realize the control, so that the local energy minima can be displaced in nanometer scale by an external magnetic field.</Para>
              <Para>The dynamics of excitons in native quantum dots of a semiconductor has been studied by a time-resolved scanning near-field optical microscope (SNOM) with a pulse excitation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. The probability density distribution of excitons and bi-excitons in semiconductor quantum dots has also been visualized using a SNOM [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. However, the excitation transfer in the model device that is fabricated to attempt application for nano-optoelectronic devices has not been investigated yet, to the best of our knowledge. We have fabricated a double quantum well (DQW) of a diluted magnetic semiconductor as a model nano-optoelectronic device, which is based on the exciton transfer via near-field optical interactions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. The excitation energy transfer rate between the quantum wells in the DQW depends on the external magnetic field. However, the transfer has not been well investigated microscopically yet. For investigating the electronic and optical properties of semiconductor quantum structures with sub-wavelength spatial resolution, we use a SNOM that works under high magnetic fields with high positional reproducibility guaranteed by the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) control method [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>In a planar quantum well of a semiconductor, excitons generated in the barrier layer by laser light relax into the well layer and migrate in the well toward local minima of exciton energy. If the energy potential barrier is higher than thermal fluctuation (in this study the fluctuation was about 1 meV), generally speaking, excitons localize at the local minima. However, excitons actually move even in that condition via both the quantum tunneling phenomenon and near-field optical interaction. The quantum tunneling phenomenon is effective only for thin potential barriers (∼ several nanometers). Near-field optical interaction is effective even for transfers with a distance of over several tens of nm. Excitons are able to transfer between resonant sites via near-field optical interactions. As is known from their hierarchical properties, exciton transfer via near-field optical interactions takes place coincidentally and independently in multiple scales [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. In fact, the resonant sites for excitation transfer are abundant in the quantum wells because of continuous variation of the excitation energy potential, and they interact with each other in a complicated way by short-range and long-range near-field optical interactions.</Para>
              <Para>Excitons localize after transferring between the local minima via thermal activation and near-field optical interaction. The position and size of localization depend on the thickness fluctuation and the doping-concentration fluctuation of the quantum well layer. A localization site for excitons corresponds to a building block of nano-optoelectronic devices. To avoid the difficulty in fabricating such blocks which have resonant energy levels for excitation transfer via near-field optical interactions and are isolated from each other, we resort to the technique of adjusting resonance condition by an external magnetic field via the Zeeman effect. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the control of position and size of the exciton localization in each quantum well of a DQW by an external magnetic field through Zeeman splitting of exciton energy levels. Finally, the switching of such excitation transfer between two quantum wells within the range of 100 nm is demonstrated.</Para>

              <Para>The sample used in this study was a DQW structure of a diluted magnetic semiconductor grown with molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>a [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]. The barrier layers were ZnSe and the well layers were ZnCdMnSe. We refer to the well that is relatively closer to the surface and the other well, respectively, as QW1 and QW2. The average thickness of QW1 was 1.7 nm (∼3 ML) and that of QW2 was 2.1 nm (∼3.5 ML). The other layers were as follows: the ZnSe bottom buffer layer (about 420 nm) on the GaAs substrate, the ZnSe barrier layer (about 15 nm), the ZnSe cap layer (about 15 nm), and the Au top layer coated for STM measurements (about 10 nm). The lowest exciton energy in ZnSe layers was about 2.8 eV. In each quantum well the stable sites for excitons that transfer with thermal activation and near-field optical interaction are generated because of the spatial variation of exciton energy levels due to the fluctuations in thickness and Mn-doping concentration, as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>b. The typical scale of the spatial variation is on the order of 100 nm. The Mn-doping concentration for QW1 was about twice as high as that for QW2. The exciton energy in the higher doped well of ZnCdMnSe is higher in zero magnetic field. So, the energy in QW1 was higher than that in QW2 in zero magnetic field. When a magnetic field is applied, the exciton energy levels in the wells split by the Zeeman effect. We set the Mn-doping concentration of the quantum wells for the energy level of QW1 to become lower than that of QW2 in a magnetic field greater than ∼7 T, as shown schematically in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>c. The splitting width in QW1 was about 8 meV in 8 T. Inter-quantum-well excitation transfer takes place by resonant transfer of excitons via near-field optical interaction. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

              <Para>We applied laser light (continuous wave, wavelength 405 nm, intensity 7 mW) to the sample surface, and took near-field optical images to visualize the stable sites for excitons using the collection-mode SNOM that was based on a STM designed for measurements at low temperatures in high magnetic fields. The collected light was detected by a photomultiplier (PMT) with long-wavelength-pass filters that cut off the laser light. All measurements were performed at 7 K. The magnetic field was applied normal to the sample surface. The topographic information taken by the STM with atomic-scale spatial resolution guaranteed the positional reproducibility for sequential SNOM measurements [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. An ITO-coated fiber probe with an aperture of about 100 nm was used.</Para>

              <Heading>Results and discussion</Heading>
              <Para>We took SNOM images at the same place in varied magnetic fields (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 T) at 7 K with a scanning area of 1 μm × 1 μm. A STM image was taken before taking a SNOM image to adjust the measurement place with a spatial resolution of 10 nm. The resolution of scanning was 128 pix × 128 pix (7.8 nm/pix). Each SNOM-image measurement took 4 h. The average intensity of measured near-field photoluminescence was about 6 cps.</Para>
              <Para>During a SNOM measurement the fiber probe detected the near-field photoluminescence from both of the two quantum wells at the same time (as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>a). To investigate the excitation transfer, we distinguished the photoluminescence from the upper well and that from the lower well. We have taken SNOM images sequentially at two different separation distances between the gold-coated sample surface and the probe apex: (1) about 1 nm (STM constant-current mode), (2) about 15 nm (we retracted the probe from the sample surface by 15 nm). We call the two separation distances, (1) and (2), respectively, SD1 and SD2 (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>a).</Para>
              <Para>The SNOM images included dark counts of the PMT so that we had to blur the images with a Gaussian filter to see the stable sites for excitons clearly. We estimated the typical size of stable sites for excitons by investigating the filter-size dependence of the matching degree between the two consecutive images taken at the same place in the same conditions. As shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>, we determined the standard deviation (<Emphasis Type="Italic">σ</Emphasis>) of a Gaussian filter to maximize the matching degree between the two images. Example images taken in 9 T at SD1 filtered with different <Emphasis Type="Italic">σ</Emphasis> are shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>a–f: <Emphasis Type="Italic">σ</Emphasis>=40 nm ((a), (d)), 80 nm ((b), (e)), and 160 nm ((c), (f)). At bright spots of the images the near-field intensity corresponds to relatively high exciton density. The images are best fitted with the Gaussian filter of 80 nm (the corresponding sites between the two images are marked by dotted circles in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>b and e). The matching degree of two filtered images (here, images <Emphasis Type="Italic">A</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">B</Emphasis>) has been evaluated by the function <Equation ID="Equ1">

The size varies between 30 and 450 nm and splits into two values at 4, 5, 8, and 9 T.

                <Superscript>−1</Superscript>exp(−<Emphasis Type="Italic">μr</Emphasis>) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. The value of <Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
                <Subscript>ps</Subscript> is ∼1 nm at SD1 and ∼15 nm at SD2. So, the intensity ratio of <Emphasis Type="Italic">I</Emphasis>
                <Subscript>QW1</Subscript> to the total intensity <Emphasis Type="Italic">I</Emphasis> at SD1 is higher than that at SD2. On the assumption that magnetic-field dependence of the typical scale is broad, we determined the magnetic-field dependence of the size in QW1 based on some of the data points (from SD1), as shown by the blue dashed line in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>h. The speculated magnetic-field dependence of the size in QW2 is also shown by the red dotted line, which is based on the remaining data points. As the magnetic field increased, the size in QW2 started to increase at 3 T and showed a peak at 4 T; that in QW1 started to increase at 6 T and showed a peak near 9 T (higher than in QW2).</Para>
              <Para>The magnetic-field dependence of the size is due to the magnetic-field dependence of the spatial variation of exciton energy levels. As the magnetic field increases, the energy level in the high-doped region and that in the low-doped region cross with each other, like the energy crossing between quantum wells (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>c). Near the crossing the spatial variation of energy levels is small, so that the size of the stable sites for excitons becomes large. In the diluted magnetic semiconductor, Mn atoms are randomly distributed in the sample and the Mn concentration determines the exciton energy in zero magnetic field. The magnetic property of each Mn atom is effective only when the nearest neighbors are not Mn atoms, so that the degree of the Zeeman shift depends on the ‘effective’ Mn concentration [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. The ratio of effective Mn atoms to the amount of Mn atoms in QW1 is lower than in QW2, because the concentration of Mn in QW1 is higher than that in QW2. As a result, the magnetic field for energy crossing in QW1 is higher than that in QW2. The speculation is in agreement with the experimental results (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>h). The magnetic field for energy crossing is ∼9 T in QW1 and ∼4 T in QW2. The magnetic-field dependence of exciton-localization size is promising for controlling nano-electronic structures formed by near-field optical interactions by an external magnetic field.</Para>
              <Para>Now we focus on the excitation transfer between the two quantum wells. Firstly, we calculate the ratio of the average intensity of the near-field optical image taken at SD1 to that at SD2, <Emphasis Type="Italic">I</Emphasis>
                <Subscript>SD1</Subscript>/<Emphasis Type="Italic">I</Emphasis>
                <Subscript>SD2</Subscript>. As described in Eq. (<InternalRef RefID="Equ2">2</InternalRef>), the image at SD1 reflects mainly the near-field photoluminescence from QW1, so that the ratio shows the exciton population ratio of QW1 to QW2, qualitatively. The magnetic-field dependence of the ratio is shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>a. The ratio is relatively low around 2–3 T and 7–8 T, which indicates that excitons transfer from QW1 to QW2 in the magnetic fields. The electronic system of a quantum well was isolated with the barrier layer of 15 nm, so that the excitons can transfer between quantum wells in resonant condition via near-field optical interactions. The resonance between wells is controlled by an external magnetic field, as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>c. The exciton energy in QW1 (<Emphasis Type="Italic">E</Emphasis>
                <Subscript>1</Subscript>) is higher than that in QW2 (<Emphasis Type="Italic">E</Emphasis>
                <Subscript>2</Subscript>) in 0 T. As the magnetic field increases, E<Subscript>1</Subscript> decreases to E<Subscript>2</Subscript> and then resonant transfer of excitons between QW1 and QW2 takes place. The direction of the exciton transfer between quantum wells is determined by the exciton relaxation into the local energy minima near the resonant sites in either quantum well. At the beginning of the energy-level crossing between quantum wells, excitons transfer into the local minima in QW1 (2–3 T and 7–8 T). As the magnetic field increases further, excitons start to transfer from QW2 to QW1. Because the magnetic-field-dependent variation of the energy is continuous, we can speculate that excitons transfer from QW2 to QW1 near 4 T and 9 T. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig3">

              </Para>
              <Para>To evaluate our speculation, we analyzed the correlation between the SNOM images taken at SD1 and those taken at SD2. We calculated the probability that the position of a bright spot in the image taken at SD1 corresponds to the position of a bright spot in that taken at SD2 within the <Emphasis Type="Italic">σ</Emphasis> of the applied Gaussian filter ∼100 nm. The magnetic-field dependence of the probability is shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>b. The probability is over 0.8 at 0 T and 5 T, and is under 0.5 at 3, 4, 8, and 9 T. The probability under 0.5 means that there is a ‘negative’ correlation between the two images, so that the spatial variation of exciton density has a negative correlation between QW1 and QW2. The negative correlation is the result from the excitation transfer between the quantum wells, as will be explained below. The reaching length of near-field optical interaction between quantum wells is up to about 100 nm (1/4 of the wavelength of 405 nm), so that the excitons in QW1 transfer to the sites in QW2 within 100 nm. In excitation transfer from QW1 to QW2, the site in QW1 that loses excitons becomes dark and the site in QW2 that receives excitons becomes bright. This is the reason for the negative correlation. The excitation transfer between quantum wells was abundant at 3, 4, 8, and 9 T, which is indicated in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>a.</Para>
              <Para>The results based on the analysis mentioned above are summarized, as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>d. The energy inversion ‘in’ each quantum well occurs at 9 T for QW1 at 4 T for QW2. The energy crossings ‘between’ the two quantum wells occur in two magnetic fields: near 2–4 T, which corresponds to the crossing between the lower branch of Zeeman-split energy levels in QW1 and the upper branch of those in QW2, and near 7–9 T, which corresponding to the crossing between the lower branch of those in QW1 and the lower branch of those in QW2.</Para>

              <Para>We have observed the localization and transfer of excitons in double quantum wells of a diluted magnetic semiconductor using a low-temperature, high-magnetic-field SNOM. We took SNOM images at the same place in different magnetic fields, and investigated the magnetic-field dependence of the localization size of excitons and the transfer phenomenon between the quantum wells with the energy crossing between them. We found that the localization size and the transfer phenomenon (the direction and the degree) are varied by an external magnetic field through the Zeeman effect without any wiring. Based on the excitation transfer mentioned above, one can construct multi-layer system devices which provide the basis of nano-optoelectronic functional systems [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>The ‘effective’ Mn concentration is important for Zeeman splitting; however, it is not clearly explained how excitons know the density. Excitons may ‘solve’ the self-consistent equation for the lowest energy state and determine how they localize. The magnetic-field dependence of the localization size (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>h) may suggest a solution for it. The revealing of the physics in the behaviors of excitons by time-resolved optical measurement with local excitations using the SNOM will be published elsewhere.</Para>
