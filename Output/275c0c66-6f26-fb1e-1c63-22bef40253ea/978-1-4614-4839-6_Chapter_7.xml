              <Para TextBreak="No">The concerns of cancer survivors in the workplace are increasingly important as the number of cancer survivors increases and as the working population ages. Most cancer survivors work after completing treatment for cancer out of economic necessity and/or a desire to regain normalcy. However, a substantial number of cancer survivors have work-related difficulty. Variables that affect work outcomes include cancer survivor demographics (particularly age, education, and job type), medical characteristics (e.g., cancer site and stage, and symptom level), cognitive and emotional factors (e.g., perceived value of work), and work environment characteristics (e.g., social support at work and work flexibility). This Chapter will assist the researcher and provider in obtaining an up-to-date review of the epidemiological factors that contribute to this public health challenge in the workplace. The Chapter will also provide a working model of cancer and work to assist in the conceptualization of this problem for occupational health. Lastly, the available literature on interventions for one outcome—return-to-work—will be discussed. Some areas for future exploration and potential application are also discussed.</Para>

              <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">To begin, as of 2007, it was estimated that there are 11.7 million individuals with a history of cancer living in the United States (American Cancer Society, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00072">2011</CitationRef>). This figure reflects a steady increase in cancer survival, which is largely credited to improvements in detection and treatment. Additional improvements in medical technology and therapy, increased exposure to risk factors, and the growing population are expected to increase the prevalence of cancer over the next 20 years. In fact, the 1.6 million new cancer cases estimated in 2010 in the US is expected to climb to 2.3 million new cancer cases in 2030 (Smith, Smith, Hurria, Hortobagyi, &amp; Buchholz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000747">2009</CitationRef>). The number of individuals who desire to remain in the workforce, which includes cancer survivors, is also increasing. Therefore, with more cancer survivors in the workplace, occupational health providers will need to become more aware of the problems and associated factors that cancer survivors experience related to work. Indeed, in order to better understand the nature of workplace problems, and to allow for more effective interventions, we will review the current state of cancer survivors in the workplace. First, we discuss the current and projected rates of cancer incidence, note trends in the age of the working population, and describe how and why work matters for many cancer survivors. Next, we discuss trends in return-to-work, work sustainability, and unemployment among cancer survivors. We present schematic figures, which depict difficulties faced by cancer survivors as they transition back to, and remain at, work. Here we include a depiction of the temporal course of work capacity, designed to illustrate the unique circumstances of individual cancer survivors as they relate to work. The Chapter then reviews the growing literature on the demographic, medical, intrapersonal, and workplace factors associated with workplace challenges for cancer survivors. The identification of these factors and further research targeting modifiable relationships should help develop new approaches to facilitate return-to-work and improve the cancer survivor’s work experience, when needed. Finally, we review the limited evidence basis for interventions related to cancer survivors and limited work outcomes. There is a tremendous need for additional advances in both research and practice, and we will discuss some promising future directions.</Para>

                <Heading>Epidemiology</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The most common cancer diagnoses among cancer survivors in the US are breast cancer (22% of all cancer survivors), prostate cancer (20%), colorectal cancer (9%), and gynecologic cancer (8%) (Altekruse et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00071">2010</CitationRef>). In the years of 1975–1979, the 5-year survival rate of all cancer sites was 49%. However, in the year 2003, this figure increased to 67% (Altekruse et al.). Cancer survival rates are largely dependent on cancer type. While prostate cancer’s 5-year survival rate has escalated from 69% (1975–1979) to 99% (2003), the 5-year survival rate of lung and bronchus cancer has increased only slightly (i.e., from 13% in 1975–1979 to 16% in 2003). Differences in the invasiveness of the tumor, ability to detect the cancer, and availability of effective treatments are likely to affect these differing survival rates.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The incidence of cancer is projected to increase by 45% between the years of 2010 and 2030, from 1.6 to 2.3 million annual cases (Smith et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000747">2009</CitationRef>). Diagnoses in older adults and minorities will account for the largest percent increase. Population growth and changes in risk factors will also ­contribute to the increase of cancer incidence (Bray &amp; Moller, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000711">2006</CitationRef>). It is important that readers recognize these are simply projections. Some researchers question the certainty of these figures because they are based on predictions of birth and death rates, which vary (Bray &amp; Moller). However, when interpreted with caution, they do support the exacerbation of a current challenge we face as more cancer survivors are in the workplace. Knowledge of future cancer incidence allows health care ­providers and public health specialists to proactively plan for cancer control programs and resources that cancer patients and survivors will need in future years (Bray &amp; Moller).</Para>

              <Section2 ID="Sec00074">
                <Heading>Increasing Age of the Working Population</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Approximately 40% of cancer survivors are between 20 and 65 years old, within the age range of the working population (Altekruse et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00071">2010</CitationRef>). Yet, even cancer survivors who are older than 65 may wish or need to work as well. The employment status of workers ages 65 and older rose by 101% between the years 1977 and 2007 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000712">2008</CitationRef>). The percent increase of males engaged in work was 75%, whereas the percent increase of females engaged in work was 147%. This trend began in the late 1990s and has continued. The aging of the baby-boom generation does not solely account for this increase. The majority of employed older Americans ages 65 and up are now engaged in full-time work. In the past, a larger proportion of older American workers were employed part-time. Between the years of 2006 and 2016, the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects that the overall workforce will rise another 8.5%. The largest increase is projected for workers ages 65 and older. Older individuals are more likely than younger individuals to develop cancer (American Cancer Society, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00072">2011</CitationRef>). The projected increase in cancer prevalence, coupled with the rising age of the workforce, suggests that there will be a growing population of workers with a history of cancer.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The current economic climate has negatively affected the labor force and may have complicated return-to-work and work sustainability for cancer survivors. The unemployment rate in the US has escalated from 4% in 2000 to 9.6% in 2010, and it is even higher for some groups (e.g., 16.0% for African Americans) (Bureau of Labor Statistics, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000713">2011</CitationRef>). The number of available jobs has decreased, making it a more competitive job market. Cancer survivors will need to remain competitive in this type of environment. Their work performance will need to meet the demands of the modern workplace.</Para>

              <Section2 ID="Sec00075">
                <Heading>Meaning of Work</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Many affected by cancer have a distinct set of problems at work compared to their peers with no ­history of cancer. These problems can make it difficult to return-to-work, function at work, and remain at work following cancer diagnosis and treatment. Qualitative studies highlight that cancer patients and survivors desire to remain employed after a diagnosis of cancer in spite of these factors. Work provides an individual with a sense of purpose, daily structure, identity, and financial support (Peteet, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000740">2000</CitationRef>; Rasmussen &amp; Elverdam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000743">2008</CitationRef>). In a discussion of the meaning of work, Peteet describes how the ability of a cancer survivor to provide for his or her family is central to that individual’s identity. When work challenges this ability, there can be a loss of one’s identity. Depressive and anxious symptoms may result. Returning to work following cancer also allows a cancer survivor to socially reintegrate. Work provides a social role for an individual where he or she can contribute knowledge and services to society (Peteet). Work also provides an opportunity to engage socially with other individuals (Kennedy, Haslam, Munir, &amp; Pryce, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000730">2007</CitationRef>). These factors allow work to provide a normalcy in cancer patients’ and survivors’ lives that they strive to achieve.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Rasmussen &amp; Elverdam (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000743">2008</CitationRef>) conducted an ethnographic study consisting of observations and interviews with cancer survivors following a stay in a Denmark cancer rehabilitation center and 18 months later. The heterogeneous group of cancer survivors (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  23) consisted of males and females between the ages of 28 and 67. The process of returning to work was illustrated by three main themes: (1) work and working life disruption; (2) the reestablishment of work and working life; and (3) daily life without work and working life. These themes were largely consistent with Peteet’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000740">2000</CitationRef>) earlier research. Work structured a cancer survivor’s life, providing a regular order and routine. Cancer survivors expressed that working after cancer allowed them to identify themselves as “ordinary.” When they were unable to return to or remain at work, their identity was challenged. Cancer survivors expressed that returning to full-time work was a goal following cancer. Being a paid employee was analogous with being “normal” and “healthy.” When the physical and emotional impact of cancer interfered with cancer survivors’ ability to work, they were left needing to create a new structure for their daily life and redefine how they identified themselves.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The financial burden of cancer also extends into cancer survivorship. The National Cancer Institute divides cancer costs into three periods: (1) the initial phase (time after diagnosis); (2) the last year of life; and (3) the continuing or monitoring phase (time between the initial phase and the final year of life) (National Cancer Institute, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000738">2010</CitationRef>). Cancers with longer survival rates often incur greater financial expenditures for cancer care during the continuing phase. Financial strain is a motivating factor to return-to-work following cancer (Kennedy et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000730">2007</CitationRef>). Work is a necessary source of income and a source of health insurance, especially in the United States. Many individuals do not consider the financial impact of cancer at the time of diagnosis (Amir, Wilson, Hennings, &amp; Young, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00077">2011</CitationRef>). However, some cancer patients or survivors report returning to work prematurely because they need to pay the mortgage and cancer-related expenses not included under their insurance policy, support their children, and cover other expenses. Cancer patients also worry that extended sick leave may negatively impact their job status (Amir et al). Financial pressure and the inability to financially provide for one’s family can exacerbate poor emotional health related to cancer.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">A subset of cancer patients continue to work after a cancer diagnosis. However, the number of hours at work can vary. In a heterogeneous sample of Detroit cancer survivors employed at time of diagnosis (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  141), most (67%) were employed 5–7 years after diagnosis. Over half of the sample (54.5%) reduced their work schedule on at least one occasion due to cancer treatment, but the majority of those (86%) did eventually return to their pre-cancer work schedule within 5–7 years after diagnosis (Bradley &amp; Bednarek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000710">2002</CitationRef>). Roelen, Koopmans, Groothoff, van der Klink, &amp; Bultmann (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000744">2010</CitationRef>) examined 5,074 Dutch employees (ages 18–60) 2 years after diagnosis, who held a paid job at time of cancer diagnosis, and whose occupational physician documented sickness absence related to cancer. Of this sample, 73% returned to work (with pay equivalent to pre-cancer time) 2 years post-diagnosis. Within the sample, receiving a disability pension (13%) and quitting due to sickness absence (6%) were causes of unemployment. Breast cancer diagnoses had the highest rate of sickness absence. Seventy four percent of breast cancer survivors were absent from work for more than 6 months, and 46% did not return-to-work for more than 12 months. Return-to-work was independent of gender for all cancer types except for blood malignancies, where women’s time to return-to-work was longer. Return-to-work did differ by type of cancer. For instance, at 2-years post-diagnosis, only 45% of lung cancer patients (204 out of 448) returned to work, whereas 88% of genital cancer survivors returned to work.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A systematic review of the early literature (1985–1999) noted that the mean rate of return-to-work after any cancer type was 62% (Spelten, Sprangers, &amp; Verbeek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000748">2002</CitationRef>). Another recent systematic review of the literature from January 2000 to November 2009 examined employment among heterogeneous cancer survivors and found a similar rate of return-to-work (Mehnert, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000736">2011</CitationRef>). On average, 63.5% of cancer survivors returned to work after an average of 151 days being absent from work. However, the percentage of cancer survivors returning to work largely differed by study (range  =  24–94%). Studies varied in cancer type, study design (e.g., cross-sectional vs. longitudinal), gender, and mean age of participants. This study indicated that, as time from diagnosis increased, a larger percentage of cancer survivors returned to work. An average of 40% of cancer patients either continued to work after diagnosis or returned to work at 6 months, with a mean of 62% at 12 months, a mean of 73% by 18 months, and a mean of 89% at 24 months.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Changes in return-to-work percentages have also been observed across time. A recent study ­conducted in the Netherlands examined an occupational health service register (Roelen, Koopmans, Groothoff, van der Klink, &amp; Bultmann, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000745">2011</CitationRef>). Patterns of return-to-work were investigated for employees in whom a diagnosis of any cancer type was made in 2002, 2005, and 2008. Both partial return-to-work (returning to work and earning 50% of salary for a minimum of 28 consecutive days) and full return-to-work (returning to work and earning 100% of salary for a minimum of 28 ­consecutive days) decreased across time in this heterogeneous sample of cancer survivors (i.e., breast cancer, genital cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer, and blood malignancies). The estimates of partial return-to-work decreased from 85% in among those diagnosed 2002, to 80% in 2005, and to 69% in 2008 in cancer survivors 2-years after diagnosis. Two years post-diagnosis, the estimates of full return-to-work decreased from 80% among those diagnosed in 2002, to 74% in 2005, and to 68% in 2008. The amount of time, ­measured in days, until cancer survivors had partial or full return-to-work all increased over the years. While not investigated in the study, the authors propose that alterations in disability policy instituted in 2004 may partially account for the decrease in return-to-work and increase in time to return-to-work. Difficulties at work that necessitate workplace accommodations, along with the economic decline during the years studied, may also have impacted return-to-work.</Para>

                <Heading>Work Sustainability</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Although the majority of cancer survivors return-to-work after a cancer diagnosis or treatment, some cancer survivors have difficulty remaining at work. In a heterogeneous group of cancer survivors (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  1,433) 4 years after cancer diagnosis, 13% left the workforce due to unspecified “cancer-related reasons” (Short, Vasey, &amp; Tuceli, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000746">2005</CitationRef>). However, the statistics on work sustainability differ across studies. In a sample of breast cancer survivors (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  416), 80% of survivors had returned to work at 12 months post-diagnosis (Bouknight, Bradley, &amp; Luo, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00079">2006</CitationRef>). Of these breast cancer survivors, 7.6% were not working at 18 months post-diagnosis. In another sample of cancer survivors, 67% of those working at their initial diagnosis were employed 5–7 years later (Bradley &amp; Bednarek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000710">2002</CitationRef>). The majority of these cancer survivors (75.4%) reported full-time employment (type of work unspecified), and many worked in excess of a 40-h workweek. Other studies, though, found that cancer patients and survivors reduce their hours after a diagnosis of cancer, primarily during active treatment (Mehnert, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000736">2011</CitationRef>). After cancer survivors return-to-work, and even after several years back at work, they report greater perceived work limitations and reduced work ability as compared to individuals with no history of cancer (Calvio, Peugeot, Bruns, Todd, &amp; Feuerstein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000714">2009</CitationRef>; Hansen, Feuerstein, Calvio, &amp; Olsen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000727">2008</CitationRef>; Taskila, Martikainen, Hietanen, &amp; Lindbohm, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000757">2007</CitationRef>). Cancer survivors attribute cancer as negatively impacting their physical and mental work ability (Taskila et al.), which may impact employment changes. Some cancer survivors indicate that they have made workplace changes (e.g., reduction in work hours) or even had to find a new place of employment (Mehnert, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000736">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Unemployment</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A meta-analysis examining employment post-cancer found an increased risk of unemployment for cancer survivors (relative risk  =  1.37, 95% CI: 1.21–1.55) (de Boer, Taskila, Ojajarvi, van Dijk, &amp; Verbeek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000716">2009</CitationRef>). The systematic search of the literature (1966—June 2008) included 20,366 cancer survivors and 157,603 healthy control participants. A higher percentage of cancer survivors were unemployed in comparison to individuals with no history of cancer (33.8% of cancer survivors, 15.2% of noncancer controls). Breast cancer (relative risk  =  1.28, 95% CI: 1.11–1.49) and gastrointestinal cancer survivors (relative risk  =  1.44, 95% CI: 1.02–2.05) had the highest risk compared to control participants. Cancer survivors reported that retirement, health problems interfering in work, business closures, and quitting work were all reasons for unemployment after cancer (Bradley &amp; Bednarek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000710">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Cancer survivors can experience work limitations or work disability even years after diagnosis and treatment for cancer. A multi-state study of over 1,700 cancer survivors in the US, who were working at time of diagnosis, found that approximately one in five women (21%) and one in six men (16%) reported cancer-related work limitations or disability 1–5 years after diagnosis (Short et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000746">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Discrimination in the workplace is a concern for cancer survivors. A study of claims filed under the Americans with Disability Act found that, compared to all other illness groups, cancer survivors were more likely to file claims reporting disputes with termination and terms of employment (Feuerstein, Luff, Harrington, &amp; Olsen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000721">2007</CitationRef>). An independent study of workplace discrimination among cancer survivors also used the same administrative data from the US Department of Justice. This study reported consistent results. However, this latter study also examined the resolution of claims and found that, compared to the general disability population, claims filed by cancer survivors were more likely to be found to be meritorious (i.e., claims indicated presence of discrimination as per ­administrative law judge) (McKenna, Fabian, Hurley, McMahon, &amp; West, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000735">2007</CitationRef>). The consistency of findings on similar data from two separate groups not aware of the others’ work was reassuring, and the positive adjudication decisions among the cancer survivor group, relative to other claimants, ­suggest the claims had merit.</Para>

For the occupational health provider, it is important not just to consider overall averages and ranges in work outcomes, but also the varied paths of individuals. The schematic diagram in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00071">7.1</InternalRef> depicts six distinct work trajectories of cancer survivors. It is intended to help occupational health professionals visualize the unique paths of individuals, and to help identify individuals who are most at risk for adverse employment outcomes or who are most in need of assistance.

Graph B shows a 32 year old male melanoma survivor who stopped working during treatment, but who is also able to resume full work responsibilities as a software developer shortly after completing treatment. Survivors A and B do not demonstrate any problems resuming full work responsibilities following cancer, and they are unlikely to need any intervention.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Graph C shows a 52 year old male colorectal cancer survivor who stopped working during treatment and then returned to work as a delivery truck driver only at a reduced level following treatment. He is experiencing symptoms of fatigue and pain that interfere with his physical function at work. Graph D shows a 43 year old uterine cancer survivor who stopped working during treatment and then returned to full work responsibilities gradually during a long period after completion of treatment. She was experiencing low energy, subclinical depression, and feelings of anxiety, which led her to feel overwhelmed in her job as a sales associate. Because these cancer survivors were not able to immediately resume full work responsibilities, their success reintegrating into the workplace is contingent on establishing open communication and clear expectations with employers, and perhaps addressing some of the symptom burden experienced. Supervisors, human resource professionals, and/or occupational health providers must work with these cancer survivors to establish expectations regarding workplace adjustments (e.g., workload, hours, physical demands, time off, and control over work). In these examples, Survivor C was able to negotiate a reduced work schedule and retrained in tasks that were less physically demanding. Survivor D worked with her supervisor to develop a gradual return-to-work plan, which also involved reducing her sales targets.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Graph E depicts a 47 year old breast cancer survivor who initially returned to full levels of work as a program manager at a large consulting firm following cancer, but whose work level then declined. Immediately following treatment, she was eager to return-to-work and received high levels of support from her colleagues. However, within a month, that support waned, and she was expected to resume her original work demands. She has been experiencing fatigue and cognitive problems (slower processing speed and problems with working memory and executive function) that make it difficult for her to multi-task and meet deadlines. Her work performance has been declining, but she is afraid to approach her supervisor to ask about work accommodations. An occupational health provider who is in contact with her oncologist could work with Survivor E to help manage her symptoms. Human resource professionals could assist her in developing work adjustments.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Graph F depicts a 38 year old female central nervous system cancer survivor who stopped working during treatment and never returned to work as a litigation attorney. She is experiencing cognitive problems as a result of treatment, including impaired word-finding, poor concentration, difficulty with short-term memory, and attention to detail. Prior to her cancer diagnosis, she had been working 60 h per week at a high-pressure law firm. She felt that her employer would not be able to adjust her work demands enough for her to function well at work. However, she wants to be able to work to help ­support her young children. She would be interested in exploring other occupational opportunities, but is discouraged about the difficulties in entering a new line of work.</Para>

In order to illustrate the multidimensional factors that can potentially influence various work outcomes among cancer survivors, Feuerstein et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000722">2010</CitationRef>) ­developed a model of work and cancer. This model (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00072">7.2</InternalRef>) provides a conceptualization of cancer survivorship and work that is designed to help guide the evaluation, prevention, and management of work-related problems in cancer survivors. The model provides a framework for future research and practice, if evidence supports this, in the area of work and cancer survivorship (Feuerstein et al.).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00072">

              <Para TextBreak="No">On the left side of the figure are factors that describe the individual’s health from a World Health Organization perspective (World Health Organization, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000760">1946</CitationRef>). These include the survivor’s medical, behavioral, and social health and well-being, as well as symptoms (long-term and late effects), all of which can affect the survivor’s ability to function physically, cognitively, emotionally, and interpersonally. Following these elements, it is proposed that the interaction between the cancer survivor’s function (physical, cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal), work demands, and work environment, at some point in time, represent the second area of focus. The nexus between these three factors is a ­critical area for consideration by occupational health providers, human resource professionals, employers, and the individual cancer survivor. Various work outcomes (depicted on the right) are possible, and are proposed to be dependent upon an optimal match between the worker’s functional ability and the work demands: If demands are below the worker’s current level of function, the individual will likely be bored; if demands are too high for the person’s level of function, job overload, or specific difficulties in completing certain job tasks can be experienced (Feuerstein et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000722">2010</CitationRef>). The work environment can be important in establishing the match between function and demand. For example, if a worker has flexibility in controlling the amount or pace of work, he/she can ensure that demands do not exceed functional ability. Social support from colleagues and supervisors can also be helpful to ensure that survivors take on work demands that are appropriate for the survivor’s work abilities, or to support the accommodations that may be required to complete essential job demands. These elements are consistent with aspects of other models of work and health (Mehnert, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000736">2011</CitationRef>); ­however, they will need specific evidence in the context of cancer and work.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The top of this model depicts the cancer survivor’s socio-demographic characteristics, while the ­bottom of the model shows the larger organizational, legal, and financial context in which the cancer survivor and his/her workplace are embedded. These variables, which are difficult to measure and change, are not necessarily direct targets for intervention for a given individual; however, they should still be considered by occupational health providers, human resource professionals, researchers, and those involved in generating policy related to work and cancer. This model represents several hypotheses that need to be supported by data. Several reviews (Amir &amp; Brocky, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00073">2009</CitationRef>; Spelten et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000748">2002</CitationRef>; Taskila &amp; Lindbohm, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000755">2007</CitationRef>) have discussed which variables are related to work outcomes in cancer survivors.

                  <Para TextBreak="No">Low education and low income are associated with lower return-to-work (Amir &amp; Brocky, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00073">2009</CitationRef>; Taskila &amp; Lindbohm, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000755">2007</CitationRef>). For example, one study of heterogeneous cancer survivors found that those with a postgraduate education are the least likely to quit working for a cancer-related reason (Short et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000746">2005</CitationRef>). A study of breast cancer survivors found that lower income and having less than a high school education was predictive of not returning to work at 12 months post-diagnosis, whereas having a college degree was associated with higher rates of return-to-work at 12 months (Bouknight et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00079">2006</CitationRef>). Similarly, a study of survivors of lung and colorectal cancer found that lower education and income were associated with lower rates of return-to-work (Earle et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000719">2010</CitationRef>). A study of breast cancer survivors 3 years after diagnosis found that a lower income at baseline was associated with not working at 3-year follow-up (Drolet et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000718">2005</CitationRef>). Reviews have noted the relationship between low education, low income, and physically demanding jobs: namely, that jobs involving physical labor are often lower paying and require a lower level of education (Amir &amp; Brocky, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00073">2009</CitationRef>). Because cancer generally lowers a person’s physical work capacity (Taskila &amp; Lindbohm, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000755">2007</CitationRef>), low-wage blue ­collar workers with a low education level are less likely to be able to return-to-work compared to higher income, higher educated workers in white collar professions.</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">Considering the variability in treatment exposures, side effects, long-term symptoms, recurrence rates of tumors, incidence of new primary tumors, and overall prognosis across different types of cancers, it is not surprising that cancer site is an important variable related to work outcomes. Among women, work disability is most common in women with cancers of the central nervous system (OR  =  5.765, 95% CI: 1.629–20.400), blood (OR  =  5.303, 95% CI: 1.706–16.487), and head and neck (OR  =  3.392, 95% CI: 1.018–11.299), whereas work disability is least common in women with history of uterine (OR  =  0.583, 95% CI: 0.184–1.850), breast (OR  =  0.621, 95% CI: 0.249–1.552), thyroid cancer (OR  =  0.752, 95% CI: 0.242–2.337), or melanoma (OR  =  0.623, 95% CI: 0.155–2.509) (Short et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000746">2005</CitationRef>). In men, work disability is most common in those with a history of central nervous system (OR  =  3.574, 95% CI: 0.922–13.861) and blood cancers (OR  =  2.181, 95% CI: 0.645–7.576), and least common in men who had prostate (OR  =  0.107, 95% CI: 0.031–0.365) or head and neck cancers (OR  =  0.197, 95% CI: 0.046–0.833) (Short et al.).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Similarly, the odds of quitting work is highest in survivors of lung cancer (OR  =  1.218, 95% CI: 0.473–3.139), blood cancers (OR  =  3.030, 95% CI: 1.238–7.416), and central nervous system cancers (OR  =  2.202, 95% CI: 0.785–6.179), and is lowest in survivors of breast (OR  =  0.440, 95% CI: 0.203–0.952), uterine (OR  =  0.377, 95% CI: 0.117–1.212), or prostate cancer (OR  =  0.485, 95% CI: 0.181–1.300) (Short et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000746">2005</CitationRef>). One review (Taskila &amp; Lindbohm, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000755">2007</CitationRef>) noted that return-to-work rates are lowest in lung cancer because of the short life expectancy, and in central nervous system cancer survivors probably because of the high recurrence and the side effects of treatment (e.g., neurologic, cognitive, sensory, or other effects) (Taskila &amp; Lindbohm). Central nervous system tumors are also characterized by a high mortality rate (Altekruse et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00071">2010</CitationRef>). One review noted that the sites with the highest rates of return-to-work are the cancer sites associated with younger age (e.g., testis and thyroid) (Mehnert, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000736">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Many of the long-term and late effects of cancer, which are prevalent in a subset of cancer survivors (often 20–30%, but it may be over 50% depending on the symptom, cancer site, and time since diagnosis), are related to delayed or lower rates of return-to-work in cancer survivors. These effects include physical symptoms (Spelten et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000749">2003</CitationRef>; Steiner, Cavender, Main, &amp; Bradley, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000750">2004</CitationRef>), depression (Spelten et al.), and functional limitations (Steiner et al.) in mixed cancer samples, and lymphedema in breast cancer survivors (Fantoni et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000720">2010</CitationRef>; Peugniez et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000741">2010</CitationRef>). Psychological symptoms, such as symptoms of depression, anxiety, or boredom, are associated with reduction in work hours (Steiner et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000751">2008</CitationRef>). Fatigue is one of the most commonly studied symptoms as it relates to work. Taskila, de Boer, van Dijk, &amp; Verbeek (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000754">2010</CitationRef>) found that, in a mixed sample of cancer survivors at 6 months after diagnosis, higher fatigue is related to greater work pressure, higher physical workload, and lower levels of work accommodations. Steiner et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000751">2008</CitationRef>) found that, in a cross-sectional study of 100 heterogeneous cancer survivors interviewed an average of 2 years after diagnosis, low energy was associated with a reduction in work hours.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In a longitudinal study of heterogeneous Dutch cancer survivors, de Boer et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000717">2008</CitationRef>) found that fatigue at 6 months post-diagnosis was a predictor of time taken to return-to-work. However, fatigue was correlated with perceived work ability and, when both were included in multivariate analyses, work ability was a better predictor (de Boer et al.). Likewise, Spelten et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000749">2003</CitationRef>) found that, in a prospective cohort study of Dutch heterogeneous cancer survivors, fatigue measured an average of 6 months after the first day of sick leave was associated with increased time to return-to-work, but that it was highly correlated with other symptoms. Another study found that fatigue was not related to duration of work absence before returning to work in Dutch breast cancer survivors (Balak et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00078">2008</CitationRef>). Methodological differences may in part account for these discrepant findings. For example, in the study of Dutch breast cancer survivors, fatigue was categorized as being present or absent based on its appearance in the medical file; the low incidence of fatigue in the study (nine patients or 13%) could be due to patients’ neglecting to mention fatigue or physicians failing to document it (Balak et al.).</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">In some cases, the decision of how much to work following treatment of cancer is a personal one, driven in large part by cognitive and emotional factors. For some, a diagnosis of cancer leads to a change in priorities; a survivor may reduce his/her emphasis on work in favor of putting greater emphasis on spending time with friends and family or pursuing other interests (Spelten et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000748">2002</CitationRef>). After cancer diagnosis, work may lose some of its meaning and importance, which may lead a cancer survivor to work fewer hours or exert less effort at work (Johnsson, Fornander, Rutqvist, &amp; Olsson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000729">2010</CitationRef>). A longitudinal study of Canadian breast cancer survivors who were employed at ­baseline found that, 3 years after diagnosis, survivors were more likely than a comparison group to report that they valued work less now compared to 3 years ago (42 vs. 26%), although only 21% of the survivors were no longer working at 3 years post-diagnosis (Maunsell et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000734">2004</CitationRef>). The authors of that study found that attaching less value to work at baseline was associated with not working at 3 year follow-up (Drolet et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000718">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>

In qualitative studies, survivors reported that employers enabled them to reduce work hours or make other work adjustments immediately upon returning to work after cancer-related absence (Yarker, Munir, Bains, Kalawsky, &amp; Haslam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000762">2010</CitationRef>). They reported that flexibility in number of hours (Kennedy et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000730">2007</CitationRef>), ability to control the pace of the workday (Kennedy et al.), adjustments in the physical demands of the job itself (Main, Nowels, Cavender, Etschmaier, &amp; Steiner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000733">2005</CitationRef>), and reduced work-related travel (Main et al.) can greatly aid in the transition to resuming work. In contrast, breast cancer survivors reported that a lack of support from employers and inflexibility in work demands made it impossible for survivors to return-to-work (Taskila et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000754">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">A review of employment outcomes in cancer survivors found that perceived employer accommodations are a consistent, strong predictor of return-to-work in cancer survivors (Mehnert, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000736">2011</CitationRef>). In a prospective study of breast cancer survivors, Bouknight et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00079">2006</CitationRef>) found that being provided with sick leave was positively associated with return-to-work at 12 months after diagnosis, and perceived employer accommodation for cancer illness and treatment needs was positively associated with return-to-work at 12 and 18 months post-diagnosis. A cross-sectional study of 328 heterogeneous cancer survivors in the UK found that having opportunities to work flexibly and paid time off for all medical appointments were associated with continuing to work during cancer treatment (Pryce, Munir, &amp; Haslam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000742">2007</CitationRef>), and a review found that control over number of hours and amount of work is related to return-to-work (Spelten et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000748">2002</CitationRef>).

                  <Para TextBreak="No">Several studies have noted how positive work outcomes appear to be tied closely to the social ­environment at work, whether it is characterized as a positive coworker attitude (Spelten et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000748">2002</CitationRef>), social support at work (Taskila et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000756">2006</CitationRef>), support from colleagues at the end of treatment (Fantoni et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000720">2010</CitationRef>) or a good social climate (Taskila et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000757">2007</CitationRef>). In contrast, a lower level of social support is associated with a higher proportion of wages lost due to cancer (Lauzier et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000732">2008</CitationRef>). Qualitative studies also provide a richer understanding of why social support matters, and how it changes over time from cancer-related absence, through the cancer survivor’s initial transition back to work, and during the longer term period of work sustainability (Amir, Neary, &amp; Luker, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00074">2008</CitationRef>; Johnsson et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000729">2010</CitationRef>; Kennedy et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000730">2007</CitationRef>; Main et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000733">2005</CitationRef>; Yarker et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000762">2010</CitationRef>). Cancer survivors interviewed in these studies described a similar trend: Participants who returned to work received a high level of support from coworkers and supervisors ­during their absence while undergoing treatment, and also received a high degree of support and understanding upon their initial return-to-work (Amir et al.; Johnsson et al.; Kennedy et al.; Main et al.; Yarker et al.). However, the cancer survivors who reported initial high levels of empathy, support, and flexibility said that these waned over time. Cancer survivors felt that, within a few weeks or months of their return-to-work, coworkers and supervisors expected them to resume their normal level of work performance (Amir et al.; Kennedy et al.; Yarker et al.). Cancer survivors reported difficulty in meeting these ­expectations because they were experiencing distressing and disabling persistent effects of cancer and its treatment, such as fatigue and cognitive difficulties, which made it difficult to resume normal work performance (Amir et al.; Kennedy et al.; Yarker et al.). Cancer survivors reported that they were not offered help or support in dealing with late effects, but they perceived that this was largely due to lack of colleagues’ knowledge about late effects (Yarker et al.).</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">The attitudes and actions of employers play an important role in the return and retention of cancer survivors in the workplace. However, relatively few studies have examined the employer’s perspective regarding the management and treatment of employees with cancer. Some of the literature on employers’ perspectives regarding workers with disabilities or chronic illness reveals potential conflicts, such as beliefs that line managers are reluctant to accommodate disabled workers’ needs, concerns that workers with disabilities would be less productive, and beliefs that coworkers would resent special accommodations that workers with disabilities receive (Fraser et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000723">2010</CitationRef>). In the UK, a survey of 252 employer representatives (primarily human resource professionals, as well as some occupational health professionals) assessed the availability of return-to-work services, as well as beliefs about successful work outcomes for cancer survivors (Grunfeld, Rixon, Eaton, &amp; Cooper, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000726">2008</CitationRef>). Most organizations (81%) were large, with over 1,000 employees. The organizations most commonly provided return-to-work assistance to employees after an absence of 3–4 weeks or 5–6 weeks. At nearly all of respondent organizations (at least 95%), return-to-work services included phased returns (e.g., gradual reintroduction of duties), change in work duties (e.g., reducing physical workload or meetings with clients), workplace adjustments (e.g., changed hours or increased breaks), and physical ­environment changes (e.g., equipment).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Respondents also rated factors that they believed were related to successful work outcomes in employees who had cancer. The most common factors rated as “very important” were: employee’s attitude toward work (95%); emotional ability to perform the job (94%); agreement between employee and employer over changes to hours/duties (91%); returning to work too soon (79%); ability to perform the job physically (78%); ability to keep the position open for the employee to return (74%); and other employees’ attitudes towards the person returning to work (72%). In another paper (Grunfeld, Low, &amp; Cooper, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000725">2010</CitationRef>) that was part of the same larger study, the authors surveyed those 252 employer representatives, as well as 194 recent cancer survivors (survivors within 4 weeks of completing treatment) who had not yet returned to work, and asked both groups about their expectations of how cancer survivors would function at work. Compared to the cancer survivors, employers had more negative expectations. Specifically, employers were less likely to say that an employee would have control over the effects and symptoms of cancer at work, and less likely to say that the effects and impact of cancer would be understood by coworkers. They were more likely to say that employees with cancer would experience symptoms at work, that cancer treatment would impair their ability to work, that employees’ work-life would be adversely affected by cancer, that an employee would be affected emotionally at work, and that cancer would affect the employee for a long time. The authors suggested that the results demonstrated that recent cancer survivors may be overly optimistic about their ability to resume normal duties at work, and that there may be a mismatch between expectations and work ability upon returning to work.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Another study (Amir et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00075">2010</CitationRef>) surveyed 370 line managers in the UK, mostly from large organizations (500–900 employees). The authors conducted a factor analysis, which revealed five types of beliefs of line managers: (1) Fearful or negative attitudes about people with cancer and doubts about their ability to fulfill their work roles; (2) supportive or positive attitudes toward people with cancer in the workplace; (3) line managers’ burden, or concern with the additional demands on line managers who oversee employees with cancer; (4) maintaining normality, or encouragement of employees with cancer to maintain sense of normalcy in their continued work roles; and (5) financial benefits, or belief that people with cancer should be provided financial benefits by staying home so that they do not need to work. The authors found that compared to male managers, female managers had less negative attitudes, believed more in employees with cancer maintaining normality, and were less concerned about line manager burden. The authors noted that the survey responses regarding line manager burden indicated that line managers had difficulty managing people with cancer, and they lacked support or guidance from senior management regarding how to handle these challenges (Amir et al.).</Para>

              <Heading>Occupational Health and Recommendations for Return-to-Work</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In general, recommendations to facilitate return-to-work include decreased workload, a gradual return-to-work, accommodations at the workplace, and rehabilitation with occupational physicians (Krause, Dasinger, &amp; Neuhauser, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000731">1998</CitationRef>; Verbeek, Spelten, Kammeijer, &amp; Sprangers, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000759">2003</CitationRef>). Appointments with occupational health physicians typically do not occur until the end of treatment, at which time the cancer patient has a greater concern about the resumption of work (Verbeek, de Boer, &amp; Taskila, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000758">2009</CitationRef>). Occupational health physicians and nurses can help cancer patients and survivors with the process of returning to work and rehabilitation, if needed. In large corporations, occupational physicians can have direct contact with the workplace. This connection can help to facilitate workplace accommodations. However, occupational physicians are generally removed from the team that treats the cancer patient (Wynn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000761">2009</CitationRef>). Therefore, their ability to intervene as effective providers may be compromised. Occupational health physicians’ limited knowledge about cancer and work also may restrict their ability to intervene for the cancer survivor. Some occupational physicians (19%) in the UK indicate not having enough information about how cancer affects work (Amir, Wynn, Whitaker, &amp; Luker, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00076">2009</CitationRef>). Likewise, only 48% of occupational health physicians sampled expressed that their training provided them with knowledge about cancer, its prognosis, and ­functional outcomes.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A Survivorship Care Plan is a comprehensive history of tumor characteristics, treatment history, surveillance timeline, and potential health and functional problems (Hewitt, Greenfield, &amp; Stovall, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000728">2005</CitationRef>). The individualized plan includes recommendations for short-term and long-term follow-up needs, including workplace difficulties. Currently, the use of these plans is limited (Stricker et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000752">2011</CitationRef>). However, these plans may allow for increased communication between the oncology team and the occupational health physician. Potentially, an occupational health physician could receive the Survivorship Care Plan to aid in the rehabilitation of the cancer survivor at work. An occupational health physician, along with primary care physicians, also may treat symptoms interfering with work. The effectiveness of these plans on work outcomes will need to be evaluated. In certain countries, such as the Netherlands, a cancer patient/survivor must see an occupational health physician to obtain a sickness absence and to return-to-work, and introducing such organized information for the survivor might improve work outcomes. Published research related to occupational health providers and ­cancer survivors returning to work is limited (Verbeek et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000758">2009</CitationRef>). This research has mainly been conducted in the Netherlands (Verbeek et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000759">2003</CitationRef>) and the UK (Amir et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00076">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">While there are more limited recommendations concerning occupational health and cancer, ­perhaps we can gain information from other models of chronic illness. Young et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000763">2005</CitationRef>) proposed four phases of return-to-work for employees with an illness and injury. Phase 1, or “Off Work,” is when the employee is not working due to the illness or injury. During “Re-Entry,” or Phase 2, the employee resumes work at his/her pre-illness workplace or a new workplace. The manner and amount of work to be completed is discussed between all parties. Continuous monitoring of the work and the return-to-work goal takes place until the employee achieves the goal. This dynamic model highlights the need to find an appropriate match between employee capabilities and job requirements. Consideration of workplace accommodations and job modifications may be necessary. Phase 3, “Maintenance,” involves maintaining the goal status and consideration into advancement at the workplace. In this sustainability phase, the employee aims at achieving goal productivity while he or she psychosocially reintegrates into the workplace. Phase 4, “Advancement,” includes promotions and increased responsibility at the workplace. The problems that cancer survivors experience at work may be specific to the cancer-related medical history. The long-term and late effects of cancer do not always occur with other chronic illnesses. At this point, we do not know the extent of the utility that generic chronic illness recommendations have for cancer survivors. However, we can use them to generate hypotheses that then need to be validated with empirical research.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">An example of such application is found in a paper by Verbeek et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000758">2009</CitationRef>). They did draw from other chronic diseases for recommendations. Verbeek et al. suggest that potential work problems should be approached following diagnosis and the creation of a treatment plan. At this point, factors such as occupation, employer–employee relations, health insurance, and social security (in the Netherlands, disability pension) can be considered. While some cancer patients may not think about returning to work at the time of diagnosis, other cancer patients express an interest in their physicians providing information on how cancer will affect their job (Frazier et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000724">2009</CitationRef>). A qualitative study of breast cancer survivors indicated that only some health care personnel discussed return-to-work with them (Nilsson, Olsson, Wennman-Larsen, Petersson, &amp; Alexanderson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000739">2011</CitationRef>). These breast cancer survivors expressed a desire for this discussion about topics, including barriers to returning to work to take place.</Para>

Interventions were categorized as psychological, vocational, physical, ­medical or pharmacological, and multidisciplinary (a combination of any of these types).

The results are summarized in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00071">7.1</InternalRef>. They found five psychological interventions (patient education, individual counseling, and/or group discussion), one physical intervention (a walking program), nine medical interventions (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, different types of surgery, and other treatments), and three multidisciplinary interventions which combined psychological, vocational, and physical components. Sixteen of the studies were conducted in the hospital, one took place in the community, and one did not report the setting. Methodological review of the studies found that there is low quality evidence of similar return-to-work rates for ­psychological interventions compared to care as usual. There is low quality evidence for medical interventions, showing that function-conserving approaches led to similar return-to-work rates as more radical cancer treatments. The authors found moderate evidence for multidisciplinary interventions with physical, psychological, and vocational elements resulting in greater return-to-work, and concluded that future intervention studies should contain multiple elements. They noted that the vocational element of interventions should focus on the work environment (e.g., work adjustments and supervisors) in addition to the individual survivor.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00071">

              <Para TextBreak="No">Another recent review article identified 23 articles describing 19 interventions, although most of them (15 of 19) were primarily focused on improving general functioning or quality of life rather than work outcomes (Tamminga, de Boer, Verbeek, &amp; Frings-Dresen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000753">2010</CitationRef>). Most of the interventions (68%) included person-directed work interventions, such as offering encouragement, education, or counseling about work. Most of the interventions (63%) did not involve the workplace, employer, or occupational physician in the intervention. Only 21% of interventions included vocational training, and 11% included work accommodations; these included rehabilitation and change of job, gradual return-to-work with limited work hours, sending letters from the treating physician to the occupational physician to increase communication, and calling or visiting the employer of patients. Only one of four controlled studies produced significant improvement in return-to-work. The authors advocated a shared model of cancer survivorship care, in which the treating physician communicates with the occupational physician or primary care physician to facilitate continuity of care. However, they only found one intervention that fit the shared care model of care.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">This Chapter provided a perspective on cancer and work that has integrated the emerging research in this area. Despite the fact that the rate of publications on this topic has increased significantly over the past decade, we are just scratching the surface in terms of our identification of variables that are actual risk factors for work outcomes in cancer survivors. While we do have some idea from this research and other work in the area of work disability of the variables that are associated with various work outcomes, we have no knowledge of the mechanism of various factors that are associated with work outcomes in cancer survivors. For example, while we have evidence that fatigue and cognitive ­challenges are related to work limitations or perceived work ability, we do not have a clear idea of the specific impact of these symptoms on actual work tasks. We also know little about the short and ­longer term reactions of supervisors and coworkers, and their impact on work processes and work outcomes. Workplace-based studies can potentially inform us in a number of areas and represent one of the next steps in this area. This research should help us refine our understanding and development of interventions directed at specific work processes and outcomes.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">As it relates to interventions, the literature clearly indicates that there is a major need for more robust evidence-based approaches that will improve outcomes through change in better documented risk factors. Such interventions should take into account these risk factors’ mechanism of action that operates on the relationship between processes in the workplace and outcomes. If it is possible to empirically document the elements and their relationships [for example, in the model presented in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00072">7.2</InternalRef> or any model of work and cancer outcomes, e.g., Steiner et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000750">2004</CitationRef>)], we should be able to develop more effective and specific interventions that would focus on correcting or changing these influences on various outcomes. This would not only make interventions more targeted to observed problems (e.g., cognitive challenges from chemotherapy or radiation exposure) but also accommodations at the workplace as well. Of course, the ultimate prevention of these symptoms might be some type of medication at the time of chemotherapy or radiation exposure that would result in the mitigation of symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive limitation, and pain. These drugs are being worked on, and it is hoped that the next edition of this text will not even need a chapter on cancer and work. However, as the model in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00072">7.2</InternalRef> illustrates, there are many more potential factors other than symptoms that are associated with various work outcomes in cancer survivors. While this model of work and cancer bears many similarities to more generic work disability models, there may be areas that differ in subtle ways in one illness over another. For example, when we consider many work-related injuries or illnesses that are sources of work disability, it is important to emphasize that many of these cases, despite the experience of pain and limitations in areas of function, receive very little support at the onset of their work absence or work problems, and are often challenged as to the veracity of their claim that the injury or illness is work related. In contrast, the cancer survivor’s cancer is generally not caused by toxic exposures at work. There is often a distinct difference in terms of initial reactions/support on the part of the employer and coworkers in these very different health problems in the ­context of work.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">As described earlier, the support for the cancer survivor at work is often very active in the initial phase of work post-diagnosis or during treatment but, as time goes on, there is less support and perhaps intolerance for a cancer survivor at work despite symptoms or late effects. In contrast, the worker with a work-related injury or illness typically receives very little support from the employer or coworkers at first, which declines even further over time. This difference might have some impact on work outcomes. We cannot assume a priori that the factors are identical or that all medical conditions influence work outcomes in a totally similar manner. Given the limited evidence on interventions in the area of cancer and work to date, the research in the last decade has not generated very many solutions. It is more accurate to say this research has helped raise awareness that, in some cancer survivors who desire or must work, not all is well when it comes to work. If one of our goals is to help those who experienced the trauma of a cancer diagnosis, treatment exposure, long-term and late effects and potential recurrence or new primary tumor, return to as normal a life as possible including work, we have much more to do. For those who want or need to return-to-work, let us continue to research and practice opportunities to mitigate or eliminate this stressor.</Para>
