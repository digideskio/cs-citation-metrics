              <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
              <Para>Though not yet clearly proven, the damage caused by early inflammatory events in multiple sclerosis (MS) is thought to spearhead a neurodegenerative process that begins early but dominates in later stages of disease. Complete abrogation of the inflammatory response by high-dose cytotoxic therapy at an early stage of MS, when the nervous system has not yet sustained irreparable damage may be successful at preventing the inexorable progression. Preclinical reports demonstrating the beneficial effect of high-dose cytotoxic therapy followed by pseudoautologous marrow transplantation in the treatment of experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) appeared in the early 1990s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR1_16">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR2_16">2</CitationRef>). The first clinical use of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for the treatment of patients with MS was reported soon thereafter (<CitationRef CitationID="CR3_16">3</CitationRef>). The role of HSCT in the treatment of MS has recently been reviewed (<CitationRef CitationID="CR4_16">4</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR5_16">5</CitationRef>). As of 2006, reports to the European Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (<CitationRef CitationID="CR6_16">6</CitationRef>) (EBMTR) and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (<CitationRef CitationID="CR7_16">7</CitationRef>) (CIBMTR) document that more than 250 patients have received autologous stem cell transplants for the treatment of refractory MS.</Para>
              <Para>Baseline disability, the intensity of the immune ablation, and depletion of lymphocytes from the graft all influence treatment outcome. Patients with a pretreatment Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) of 6.5 or more tend to have sustained disease progression following transplantation compared to those with a pre-transplant EDSS of 6.0 or less. High intensity conditioning regimens such as Cyclophosphamide with total body irradiation (<CitationRef CitationID="CR8_16">8</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9_16">9</CitationRef>) or Busulphan with Cyclophosphamide, as used in our study, provide better disease control than less aggressive regimens such as BEAM (<CitationRef CitationID="CR1_16">1</CitationRef>), however, the more intensive HSCT regimens also have greater acute toxicity. Adoptive transfer of aberrant immune responses has been documented in recipients of lymphocyte-replete hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) grafts; thus MS may persist if autoreactive lymphocytes are reintroduced into the patient via the HSC graft (<CitationRef CitationID="CR10_16">10</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR11_16">11</CitationRef>). While, there was no difference in MS disease response following HSCT with lymphocyte-replete or lymphocyte-deplete grafts in one study (<CitationRef CitationID="CR12_16">12</CitationRef>), technical issues such as poor lymphocyte depletion using first generation stem cell selection technology and a low intensity HSCT regimen complicate its interpretation.</Para>

              <Heading>Patient Selection</Heading>
              <Para>Patients considered for this treatment must have a diagnosis of active multiple sclerosis made by a neurologist expert in the field, and demonstrate relapses or progression, with sustained accumulation of impairment. Their MRI brain scan must satisfy the MRI criteria of Paty or Fazekas for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Evidence for current activity includes a deterioration in the EDSS score of 1 or more in the 18 months prior to enrollment if the EDSS score is &lt;5.5, a deterioration in the EDSS score of 0.5 or more in the 18 months prior to enrollment if the EDSS score is ≥5.5 or at least two significant relapses in the last year, or three significant relapses in the last 2 years. Patients must have an EDSS score from 3.0 to 6.0 with an EDSS Cerebellar Functional score ≥3 or EDSS Pyramidal Functional score ≥3. We feel that these patients have disabilities that are significant enough to impact their lifestyle and yet are likely to be a stage where the CNS lesions are due more to inflammation than to scarring. The patient should have a sufficiently poor prognosis (a high probability of progression according to the criteria of Weinshenker (<CitationRef CitationID="CR13_16">13</CitationRef>)) to warrant the risks associated with this therapy. Poor prognostic features include multiple relapses (e.g., ≥5 in the first 2 years of disease), or attaining a Kurtzke Functional System Score (FS) of at least 3 (or findings consistent with a FS of 3) affecting pyramidal/cerebellar subscores within 5 years of onset. Patients should have failed standard therapy for MS as shown by progression or continued relapses or worsening MRI after at least 1 year of therapy with Interferon-β, Glatiramer acetate, Mitoxantrone, or other immunosuppressive drug therapy.</Para>
              <Para>Patients who have previously received a cytotoxic agent (Mitoxantrone, Cyclophosphamide, etc.) must have normal bone marrow morphology and cytogenetics before being considered for HSCT. Significant cardiac, renal, pulmonary, or hepatic dysfunction, active infections, or other medical problems that would appreciably increase the patient’s risk of morbidity or mortality, are contraindications to HSCT.</Para>

              <Heading>Preparative Phase</Heading>
              <Para>A bone marrow is cryopreserved, to be used in case of persistent pancytopenia or immunodeficiency following the CD34-selected autologous HSCT. The collection of this autologous graft is performed as a day hospital surgery. An indwelling central venous catheter is placed at the same time to provide vascular access during HSCT (<CitationRef CitationID="CR14_16">14</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR15_16">15</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Autologous Bone Marrow Harvest</Heading>
                <Para>The patient is taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthesia. Once intubated and ventilated, the patient is rolled into the prone position on bolsters that support the trunk, head, and neck. The patient is prepped from the base of the buttocks to the mid-back. An 8-gauge bone marrow aspiration needle (Snarelock bone marrow biopsy needle, Angiotech) is inserted percutaneously in the posterior iliac crest and the trochar removed. A 60-ml syringe, pre-rinsed in a heparin solution (10,000 unit heparin per liter NS), is attached to the needle and 10–20 ml of marrow is aspirated using vigorous suction. The needle is removed and the marrow is collected in a marrow graft collection bag (Bone Marrow Collection Kit R4R2107, Baxter) containing 100 ml of ACD-A (<CitationRef CitationID="CR2_16">2</CitationRef>) per liter of bone marrow. The needle is rinsed in heparin solution and the trochar is replaced before re-use. The aspiration is repeated multiple times by two surgeons, one working on the right side and the other working on the left side until a total of 10–15 ml of bone marrow per kg of patient weight is collected. At the end of the procedure, the marrow is filtered through sequential 800–200-μm filters to remove coarse particles.</Para>

                <Para>Bone marrow mononuclear cells are enumerated using a Coulter counter. HSCs are enumerated by flow cytometry following staining with anti-CD45-FITC and anti-CD34-PE using the ISHAGE method (<CitationRef CitationID="CR16_16">16</CitationRef>). The bone marrow graft must contain a minimum of 1.5 × 10<Superscript>8</Superscript> marrow mononuclear cells/kg of recipient weight to be considered adequate, before the patient proceeds to the next stage of the clinical protocol.</Para>

Briefly, the bone marrow buffy coat is isolated from the bone marrow graft following centrifugation on a Cobe 2291 Cell Processor. The bone marrow buffy coat is mixed with an equal volume of chilled cryoprotectant solution (<CitationRef CitationID="CR3_16">3</CitationRef>) and divided into two aliquots which are transferred to individual cryobags (Cryocyte Freezing Container, Baxter) for storage in the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen container.</Para>

                <Para>Following the marrow collection, while still under general anesthesia, the patient is rolled into the supine position. A central venous catheter is inserted according to the manufacturer’s procedures. Briefly, the surgeon creates a subcutaneous tunnel by blunt dissection of the subcutaneous tissues between an incision on the anterior chest wall (exit site) and an ipsilateral subclavicular incision (entrance site). Using a Seldinger technique at the entrance site, a double-lumen central venous catheter is placed into the subclavian vein and advanced into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic control. The catheter is tunneled from the entrance to the exit incision on the anterior chest wall and positioning the catheter’s Dacron cuff just inside the exit tunnel. The incisions are sutured closed and the patient is awoken from anesthesia. A standard chest radiograph is used to confirm the position of the catheter tip and the absence of pneumothorax at the end of the procedure.</Para>

              <Para>Autologous HSC are collected and cryopreserved as a source of stem cells for the reconstitution of the bone marrow and the immune system prior to administering the immune ablative therapy. Chemotherapy and recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) stimulate the mobilization of HSC into the circulation. The circulating white blood cells (WBC), now enriched in the patient’s own HSC, can be collected by leukopheresis. The HSCs are purified away from contaminating immune cells in the graft by immunomagnetic selection of cells expressing CD34, a HSC expressed antigen. While hematopoietic growth factors alone can be used to mobilize HSC into the circulation, it has been associated with flares of the underlying autoimmune disease. Coadministration of steroids and cytotoxic chemotherapy prevent the cytokine-associated exacerbation of the MS.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

The risk of developing chemotherapy-induced nausea is minimized using HT<Subscript>3</Subscript> antagonists and steroids. Hyperhydration, Foley catheter drainage of the urinary bladder, and Sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate (MESNA) administration are used to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis, a complication of cyclophosphamide administrations that is of particular concern in MS, given the bladder dysfunction that often accompanies this illness.</Para>

If venipuncture access is inadequate, a dialysis type catheter may need to be placed temporarily to allow adequate venous access. Blood is drawn from the patient and through the leukopheresis machine, collecting the WBC and returning the other blood components to the patients. Fifteen to twenty liters of blood is processed on each collection day.
