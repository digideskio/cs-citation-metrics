          <Para TextBreak="No">Agricultural small-scale producers in communal areas found mainly in the northern and southern parts of Namibia keep small stock as a means to attain food security and wade off widespread poverty as many residents perceive poverty as having no livestock, land and water. Dependence on small-stock dates back over 1,000 years during when nomadic pastoralists shifted their settlements seasonally in search of water and grazing. Currently, small-stock farming is one of the four major farming systems dominantly practiced in the rugged lowlands of western parts of the country ideal for goat farming and in the rolling plains of southern Namibia ideal for extensive sheep grazing. The eastern part of the country is dominated by cattle ranching while an integrated farming system is practiced in northern communal lands where roaming cattle herds, goats and to a lesser extent sheep are prevalent. Indigenous breeds with valuable genetic properties that contribute to high fertility and resistance to disease survive well in all communal lands. Goats and sheep contribute substantially to household food security because they provide food and are easy to convert into quick cash required in meeting immediate household needs; they can also be bartered for household commodities. Small stock, mainly goats form part of government’s resettlement schemes initiated to mitigate poverty and secure food security among previously landless now settled as agricultural small-scale producers.</Para>

          <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">There are three broad categories of land tenure in Namibia. Approximately 44 % of the country is allocated to the so-called “commercial” farmland with freehold tenure, 41 % is allocated to communal areas, and the remaining 15 % is state land including conservation areas. The communal areas are situated mainly in the north and south of the country, while the commercial (freehold) areas occupy most of the centre and part of the south parts of the country (Mendelsohn and el Obeid <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2002</CitationRef>; Schneiderat <CitationRef CitationID="CR033">2011</CitationRef>). Apart from the small north-eastern strip, the country’s climate is described as dry. However, micro-climatic conditions exist and are highly variable. Generally, large seasonal variations are experienced where summers are very hot and wet and winters are cold and dry. High temperatures are experienced for most part of the year particularly during summer during when most of the annual rainfall is received. A small part of the country in the very south-west of the country receives winter rainfall associated with frontal systems. The annual potential evapotranspiration exceeds annual precipitation by ratios of up to 30:1 (not counting the desert areas); hence aridity is a common feature throughout most of the country. These conditions greatly narrow the choices of viable economic activities that can be undertaken to mitigate poverty and back up food security of the agricultural small-scale producers inhabiting 41 % of the country i.e. communal areas. An activity that has shown great potential is rearing small stock such as goats and sheep.</Para>

          <Heading>Namibia Poverty Defined</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Namibia is reputed to have the most unequal income distribution in the world. Its Gini Coefficient of 0.63 in 2003/2004 placed it right at the top of a selection of 30 countries (Werner and Odendaal <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2010</CitationRef>). This scenario is partly an outcome of the apartheid regime policies before Namibia’s independence in 1990 which restricted access to land and economic resources to the majority of citizens and partly due to Namibia’s traditional reliance on resources that are difficult to extract such as marine fish and minerals/precious stones including diamonds, gold and uranium which means that production is highly technical and/or capital intensive rather than labor intensive.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Prior to independence in 1990 and soon after, people who were landless or who were not in formal employment or engaged in non-agricultural activities were categorized as poor (The National Land Policy, Republic of Namibia, National Planning Commission <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">2006a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">b</CitationRef>). The National Planning Commission (NPC) put forward a narrower definition of poverty which put an upper limit of poverty at N$262.45 per month per capita (i.e. N$3,149 per person or N$15,747 per household of 5 people). Thus using this definition, technically the average Namibian household of slightly more than 5 people earning less than N$15,747 per annum is defined as poor. According to this definition of poverty, the review categorized 27.6 % of all Namibians to be poor and 13.8 % as severely poor. Most poor households were found in rural rather than urban areas. Just over 38 % of rural households were poor and 19 % of those were severely poor. The corresponding figures for urban areas were 12 % and 6 %.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">To assess the peoples’ perception on poverty, the government initiated a program of participatory poverty assessment in all regions of the country from 2004 to 2006. Responses from the assessment revealed that people in the rural areas see poverty as lack of well-being which they defined by the ownership of assets such as livestock and formal employment as well as having access to sufficient land and water for both humans and livestock. The survey among farm workers revealed that they considered their lives as being similar to that of flies: constantly hungry and moving from one place to another in search of food until they fall down and die in the milk. This comparison describes the vulnerability emanating from the high mobility of farm workers who are always on the lookout for work seeking better living conditions. Not having a house or place of their own to which they can retreat when they lose their employment exacerbates their vulnerability to poverty. Lack of resources or having limited access to resources for subsistence farming with livestock or gardening was seen as central to poverty. Thus for many people, access to land, water and livestock is a fundamental ingredient of well-being (Werner and Odendaal <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The peoples’ perception on poverty is also reflected in national policies and political rhetoric where land reform features very strongly as a fundamental ingredient in tackling poverty issues. The National Land Policy requires the government to ensure that the poor are settled on productive land where they can productively participate in economic activities. The Namibian Cabinet was reported to have stated that without achieving a breakthrough in the land reform program, the fight against poverty would not succeed. NDP2 (2001–2005) which was intended to concretize the Poverty Reduction Strategy did not feature very strongly the land reform strategy. However, although improved access to land through land reform did not feature in detail in NDP2, it was mentioned that land would be provided to poor landless families. The issue did not feature either in the third 5-year development plan (NDP3) which was released in 2008. The overarching strategies of NDP3 to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty included strengthening and diversifying the agricultural base of poor rural communities by encouraging diversification and improving agricultural production to make sure that beneficiaries of land redistribution contribute to developing the country’s economy. Therefore there was a deliberate shift from just land provision to landless people; emphasis was placed on making land available to those who have the means and skills to manage the land productively.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Although the emphasis had shifted to the ability of the beneficiaries to farm productively, provision was made for resettlement programs of a social welfare type which offered appropriate support services to accommodate people who lack assets and/or farming skills. In this respect, the government initiated two settlement schemes to provide land to the landless which were aimed at reducing poverty among the landless and assist them contribute towards the development of the country’s economy and towards alleviating poverty and food insecurity, the government acquired previously large scale farms and allocated them to the landless people. The basic concept underlying the approach was that beneficiaries were to engage in small-scale small stock rearing and small-scale dry-land crop farming for own consumption. There was a clear distinction between economic land redistribution and land-based “welfare” programs. Initially when the government settled needy people it accorded them support to enable them establish themselves in their new resettled farms. However during the late 1990s and early 2000s the emphasis was placed on allocating land to self supporting beneficiaries probably due to inability of the government to meet spiraling costs of resettling and supporting all the beneficiaries on monthly basis which was instituted during the initial resettlements in the early 1990s.</Para>

          <Heading>Small-Stock Farming in Namibia</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Historically, small-stock has been farmed in southern and north-western Namibia for at least 1,000 years during when nomadic pastoralists shifted their settlements seasonally in search of water and grazing. Currently, small-stock farming is one of the four major farming systems practiced in Namibia (RAISON <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2006</CitationRef>). Small-stock farming is dominantly practiced in southern and western Namibia in a semi-arid area lying between true desert to the west (Namib Desert) and savanna woodlands to the east and north. This farming system covers about 33 % of Namibia, and extends over most of Hardap, Karas, much of Erongo, south-western Kunene, and small parts of southern Khomas and Omaheke). Small-stock farmed in Namibia includes Damara sheep, various indigenous breeds of goats, Boer goats and Blackhead Persian sheep (Mendelsohn <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2006</CitationRef>). About 60 % of all Namibian goats belong to indigenous breeds, variously called North-western, North-central, Caprivi or Kavango breeds. Many of these goats have valuable genetic properties that contribute to high fertility and resistance to disease. In Namibia, goats are kept and survive well in all communal lands.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Poverty stricken indigenous small stock farmers inhabiting communal land in southern Namibia own small herds of goats, sheep and few cattle (Lowrens <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2004</CitationRef>). Goats predominate in the communal farming districts while Dorper sheep make up the highest percentages of livestock on freehold farms. Some wealthier part-time farmers also farm the communal lands of southern Namibia but unlike the indigenous poor farmers, they own hundreds of animals creating a great deal of competition for grazing around established water points after good rains. These wealthier farmers move their animals to distant grazing areas where they use vehicles to cart water for their animals. Thus the herds of the poor farmers suffer and losses are common due to lack of grazing, water and diseases. Also involved in small-stock farming are well off freehold farmers who employ indigenous people as farm workers on temporary terms or as casual laborers who perform manual work in what are normally large farms (Werner and Odendaal <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Southern Namibia, dominated by rolling plains intercepted by long sand dunes and linear inter-dune valleys is ideal for extensive sheep grazing. Bursts of palatable grasses become available shortly after sporadic rainfall storms but lasts for short periods before wilting and dying under the scorching sun characteristic of these semi-arid areas. Success in farming in these areas heavily depends on water availability in boreholes and water pools and wells dug in the dry sandy river beds.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Several breeds of mutton sheep and cross-breeds or hybrids currently farmed in Namibia include Dorper, Damara, Van Rooy and Blackhead Persian. Dorper breed which was specifically developed for farming in arid areas forms the backbone of the country’s mutton industry. While Dorpers produce valuable meat, they require more water and high quality food and are more vulnerable to parasites than other breeds. Dorpers do not flock well and are therefore not suitable for unfenced communal farmlands. On the other hand, Damara sheep which are indigenous to Namibia are hardy and well adapted to conditions of limited water and food supply. Damara sheep has tasty meat, good resistance to parasites, and are known for their varied diet with up to 64 % of its food consisting of browse (similar to goats and higher than other sheep that eat more grass). Damara ewes also take exceptional care of their lambs. The breed is well suited to communal areas because it requires relatively little care. Like the Damara sheep, Van Rooy sheep which originated from South Africa are hardy, resistant to diseases and have unlimited mating season as well as good maternal care. They are thus suited to the dry conditions prevalent in the communal lands in the southern part of the country (ARD <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Two other breeds of sheep which survive well in the dry lands of Namibia include the Karakul and the Blackhead Persian sheep which probably originated from Somaliland and Arabia. The Blackhead Persian sheep are small, have lower needs for food and water, and have greater heat tolerance and higher fertility than most other breeds. They may breed in any season, and have high resistance against disease and parasites. However, this breed is not very popular with formal market consumers due to its fatty meat. The Karakul found on scattered freehold farms in Hardap and Karas Regions perform well under arid conditions, provide wool suited for carpets and good mutton which unfortunately is also too fatty for the formal market. Compared to other breeds, Karakul production is usually less risky because they require less maintenance and have high levels of resistance to parasites. During very dry periods, the ewes survive because their lambs are slaughtered for pelts. These sheep are easy to manage because they gather in flocks.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The rugged lowlands of western parts of the country are ideal for goat farming due to the presence of ephemeral river valleys lined with perennial riverside forests along ephemeral rivers and open woodlands and shrubs. Here browse and fallen pods support large herds of goats and to a lesser extent sheep. North-western part of the country, goats are kept alongside cattle by indigenous tribes inhabiting the dry lands along Kunene River and associated highlands bordering Angola. These people in this part of the country in Kunene district have an advantage over those in the southern parts of the country because they own more goats and cattle which they take to the better watered mountainous parts bordering Angola during prolonged dry spells and during droughts. In the Angolan highlands and valleys, they find ample grazing and browse for their livestock (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">5.1</InternalRef>).

          <Para TextBreak="No">Goats are known to be largely browsers although sometimes they may consume grass because goats more than any other domestic animals are very opportunistic. Studies carried out in different parts of the world including in Namibia have demonstrated that goats prefer browse and do survive on forage produced by woody plants rather than on herbaceous plants. When they consume herbaceous plants they prefer herbs, bulbs, weeds and other ephemeral plants including woody plants known to invade overgrazed savanna rangelands (Rothauge et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2003</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR032">2004</CitationRef>). During dry seasons, goats survive by consuming tree pods that fall onto the ground and those on low branches (Figs. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">5.2</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">5.3</InternalRef>).

          <Para TextBreak="No">Therefore goats do not present serious competition to sheep and cattle who are grazers; they can actually survive on degraded rangeland where few other domesticated livestock can survive. Goats are thus suited to the sparsely vegetated arid lands of southern and northwestern Namibia and to some extent the semi-arid rangelands in the eastern part of the country. It is documented that in Namibia, there are very high incidences of range deterioration through bush encroachment which has rendered rangelands more suitable for browsing animals such as goats. It is also documented that people living in communal areas in southern Namibia (Karas Region) prefer that any development projects that would be initiated in their areas include goat production including training on good practices that would lead to increasing heard size (Lowrens <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2004</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The majority of goats in Namibia are of indigenous breeds which form part of small-scale integrated farming systems where they are kept alongside cattle and sheep. They are used for myriad of purposes including milk production, meat and a host of cultural practices. Smaller percentages of Boer goats, Angora and dairy goats are also found in the country. Boer goats, indigenous to Africa are hardy, highly productive (they have high percentages of twins), have high resistance to external parasites and have lean tender meat that has low cholesterol content (Rothauge et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2003</CitationRef>). Their only disadvantage is that Boer goat kids are vulnerable to lice and ticks and have low resistance to several diseases. They thus require constant care with good veterinary services and highly hygienic housing conditions. They do not fare very well in communal areas where different breed of animals (such as donkeys, sheep, goats and cattle) are kept together in one kraal. While there is low demand for goat meat in Namibia, South Africa offers a lucrative market for live goats mostly in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape (Werner and Odendaal <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The eastern part of the country bordering Botswana popularly known as “cattle country” or officially as Omaheke Region is predominantly a savannah environment in which <Emphasis Type="Italic">Terminalia combretum</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Acacia</Emphasis> savannahs are the dominant types of vegetation. Forest and woodland savannahs of the northern Kalahari, camel thorn savannahs of the central Kalahari and mixed shrub vegetation of the southern Kalahari are the region’s dominant vegetation zones. Omaheke Region as a whole has low suitability for crop cultivation and extensive cattle ranching predominates; it has some of the best grazing areas in the country. In some parts of the region sheep and goats are farmed on a small-scale mostly for own consumption; small surpluses are sold privately. Small herds of goats and to smaller scale sheep are kept alongside cattle which are the main livestock in the region.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In the northern communal lands an integrated farming system is practiced where roaming cattle herds, goats and to a lesser extent sheep are prevalent. The main crops that form part of this integrated farming include pearl millet, sorghum, corn, and a variety of pulses such as beans and cowpeas. In these communal lands grazing land is shared and unlike in the south and eastern parts of the country where commercial land is fenced off, unfenced communal land tenure is the norm. No fencing is allowed legally except around the home and crop fields. Sheep and goats are herded during the cropping season in cropping areas, and where there are predator or theft risks in other areas, but herding tends to be relaxed during the dry season during when animals have access to crop residues. Pigs and poultry kept by few inhabitants of these communal lands are free-ranging and scavenging, although some owners practice housing and feeding (Isaacson <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">1995</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The northern communal areas of Namibia are home to more than 60 % of the Namibia’s population, majority of who depend on both livestock and crop farming for their daily sustenance. In 2006, 1 % of all sheep and 38 % of all goats were found in the northern communal areas compared to 9 % of all sheep and 27 % of all goats which were found in the southern communal areas. During this time, cattle formed the majority of all livestock found in the northern communal areas which totaled 44 % compared to just 17 % in the southern communal areas (Werner and Odendaal <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In the northern communal areas, there is no room for spatial expansion of livestock numbers because livestock densities are already very high and the resource base on which livestock depends is poor and declining. Currently the livestock largely depend on grazing annual grasses as there is no supplemental feeding making livestock production highly risky. Below-average rainfall years are fraught with high probability of a crash in livestock numbers as was experienced in the 1980s and early 1990s (Kruger and Werner <CitationRef CitationID="CR031">2007</CitationRef>). The scenario was repeated during 2012/2013 rainfall year because like the early 1980s and 1990s Namibia experienced severe drought conditions and livestock owners suffered colossal losses particularly cattle in the northern communal areas.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Between mid-1990s and the whole of 2000s livestock numbers increased substantially in the northern communal areas so that in 2006, more than 45 % of the total cattle herd in the country was held in the six regions of the northern communal areas. This overstocking and associated range degradation foretells large scale livestock losses and associated social impacts. Even though cattle are kept in different cattle-posts to minimize risks associated with drought and disease, the cattle numbers far exceeds land carrying capacity. There is therefore great need to make efforts to change the perceptions and attitudes of the inhabitants of these communal lands so that the inhabitants can realize the commercial value of livestock and to pro-actively market excess livestock when animal condition is still good and prices are high. The majority of cattle are kept in the cattle-post areas but some milk cows are brought back to the homesteads at the start of the rainy season and as grazing become available. With an increase in population density and the subsequent increased demand for crop fields, less grazing area is now available around homesteads so that animals stay for shorter periods of time. In most cases only limited management of livestock takes place, animals roam freely seeking the best grazing possible. They wonder back home to kraals on their free will. Sometimes the owners go out to guide the animals to watering points and to later round them up and guide them home at the end of the day. In these parts of the country, livestock are seen as an effective “savings bank.” Goats rather than cattle are largely sold when the need for disposable cash arises.</Para>

          <Heading>Small-Stock and Food Security</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">On a broader scale, goats farming is reported to be the best choice for attaining food security for agricultural small-scale producers in developing countries due to the fact that goats have low investment, they are easy to manage, they have wide adaptability, high fertility and high fecundity as well as high feed conversion efficiency, quick pay-off and low risk (Mutenje et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2008</CitationRef>). Small stock (mainly goats and sheep) play an important role in the livelihoods and food security for the agricultural small-scale producers in both southern and northern Namibia. In Namibia, goats and sheep contribute substantially to household food security by providing income, quality meat and milk as well as manure. Goats and sheep are valuable assets for a majority of rural households because they are easy to convert into quick cash required in meeting immediate household needs; they can also be bartered for household commodities. They are often referred to as “walking bank” or “bank on the hoof” to be called upon in times of need, stress or hardship because they are central to people’s livelihoods, food security and nutrition. The high survival rates common to goats make them a means of risk mitigation during crop failures; goats are used as property security, monetary saving and investment in addition to many other socio-economic, religious and cultural functions (Peacock <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Both goats and sheep have short gestation interval and high frequency of multiple births which allow rapid increases in animal numbers which build financial capital. Goats and sheep contribute directly and indirectly to food security as they contribute directly to the sustainability of crop farming by providing manure for the integrated farming system practiced by some small-scale producers in the communal areas thus increasing soil fertility. Goats and sheep are an important means of empowering vulnerable households including those affected by HIV/AIDS, those which are female-headed and those which are perceived as poor because they play a significant role in the nutrition and in smoothening income fluctuations for these vulnerable groups (Mutenje et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Despite the central role that goats play in strengthening food security in the communal areas of southern and northern Namibia, several constraints face goat farming including diseases outbreaks as a result of congestion and poor hygienic housing conditions consisting of poorly constructed open kraals where all animals are housed together throughout the year. In the northern communal areas, these kraals are cleaned at long intervals of up to over 4 years. This results in outbreak of diseases during wet seasons leading to large losses of goat kids (Isaacson <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">1995</CitationRef>). High mortality rates have been recorded among the exotic Boer goats due to poor management and small-scale producers’ inability to fulfill the conditions required for such breeds. Furthermore, overstocking and severe overgrazing especially during winter when natural pasture is reduced to zero results in insufficient feeding because many small-scale producers cannot afford supplementary feeds due to costs involved, thus starvation and high losses. High transport costs and long distances to veterinary service centers compel the small-scale producers to resort to treating their goats and other animals using indigenous herbs and traditional medicines which do not seem to be effective on the Boer goats. Inadequate water sources and long distances to lakes, dams or boreholes have forced some of these producers to water their animals with polluted water from wells which cause diseases and complications to the Boer goats (Molefe <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">1985</CitationRef>). Therefore indigenous breeds should be given higher preference over the more productive introduced breed.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Further, there are several other constraints that affect the small-scale small stock producers in the southern and northern communal areas centered on access to markets, abattoirs and prices offered for their small stock. The small-scale producers often claim that prices they get for selling their goats in auctions and at abattoirs are very low compared to what they get from private agents who pay a fixed price without looking at the grade of the animal. However, this informal channel is neither reliable nor dependable. Many sellers opt to walk the animals to markets which results in weak and lean animals by the time they reach the market outlets. Most of the goats sold are placed on B<Subscript>1</Subscript> and B<Subscript>2</Subscript> grades; the prices for both grades are very low. Other than long distances walked to abattoirs and formal markets, insufficient feeding and poor quality pastures exacerbate the poor condition of the goats that reach abattoirs. To improve on the quality of their goats, small-scale producers must be encouraged to invest in housing, supplemental feeds and veterinary services.</Para>

          <Heading>Food Security of Vulnerable Indigenous Groups</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In Namibia, the San are among vulnerable indigenous people who are categorized together with agricultural small-scale producers. The San, originally hunters and gatherers depended wholly on the natural resources of the land they roamed freely; they lived in harmony with their environment. However with invasion of their lands by agricultural and other economic ventures, they were compelled to give up their survival mode and participate in agricultural and other economic activities. The 1991 census indicated that there were 12,921 San on commercial farms (47.5 %), 14,024 in communal areas (51.5 %) and 284 in urban areas (1 %). Living conditions for this group of agricultural small-scale producers differ significantly in commercial and communal areas. While the majority of San who obtain employment on commercial lands have no right to the land and have to make a living as farm laborers/domestic workers or as urban squatters, those who got settled in resettlement schemes located in communal areas are better off because they have access to land and are free to either farm or establish conservancies and community forests on communal land. Also those living in or close to conservancies are fortunate in that because they have access to land and can manage the natural resources of the land and practice, to varying degrees, their traditional lifestyles. Despite this breather, the settlement farms do not offer complete solution to all the San people in Namibia. At present there are some San people who were not officially resettled and who are still at the mercy of better off farmers in both the communal and commercial areas as well as other sorts of employers where they are marginalized and subjected to unfair labor practices (Suzman <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">1995</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">2001a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">b</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">An outcome of the government’s initiative to give land access to the vulnerable indigenous people who were displaced by commercial agricultural activities saw six commercial farms allocated to the resettlement of the Hai||om San on the southern border of the Etosha National Park (the ancestral land of the Hai||om) and one farm in the Otjozondjupa Region for other San groups who were encouraged to farm with goats and grow their own food. Many Hai||om from the surrounding commercial land area and the towns in the vicinity moved to these farms. However, as on other resettlement farms in Namibia, establishing sustainable livelihoods independent of government food aid and massive external support has proven difficult because these people who were hunters and gatherers have to learn new production techniques different from their traditional modes of survival. Success is minimal because crop growing and livestock farming is new to these people just like permanent settlements. It is gratifying to see that some of San youths and young children have been exposed to formal education which is hoped will help them influence the older generations on alternative land management and livelihood system.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">During 2010, as part of the San Development Program, the Office of the Prime Minister established the “Back to School and Stay at School Campaign”. Its main objective is to encourage learners from marginalized communities such as the San to attend school and remain in school, and receive a good education like other citizens in Namibia (ODPM <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2008</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2011</CitationRef>). Also the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA) continued its special education program for the San, which specifically supports Early Childhood Development but also helps with bursaries for San students in different fields. During the year, three San students from Namibia took part in a 9-month training course at the San cultural and education centre, !Khwa ttu, located 70 km northwest of Cape Town in South Africa, in which they developed their skills in community-based tourism and hospitality. Additionally, they learned about life skills, San issues, rock art, botany and environmental issues. Local news papers and news broadcasts from time to time report more and more successes on formal training of San children several of who have graduated from tertiary institutions in recent years.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Other efforts to assist the San are being made on a regional level. The San are represented by the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA), which comprises the national San Councils of Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. Many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are assisting indigenous peoples in Namibia in various aspects (e.g. education, human rights, and livelihoods). Most of these NGOs are part of the San Support Organizations’ Forum (SSOF), which was established in 2009 as a platform of stakeholders working with San in Namibia. This platform encourages win-win situations, it offers the opportunity to present ongoing activities in the various regions, to discuss and negotiate matters with government agencies, to share ideas, lessons learnt and best practices and to improve the coordination of the various San support initiatives. The platform further gives the opportunity to align the work of the different stakeholders with international standards, such as the UNDRIP.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In Namibia, tourism comprises one of most important sources of income. Indigenous communities throughout the country, some of which include and involve the San people, have established several tourism-related projects. As of 2010, it was reported that at least ten indigenous communities in conservancies are involved in joint venture tourism agreements with lodges and other tourism companies (NACSO <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2010</CitationRef>). There are other projects that are geared towards supplementing the San’s livelihoods in the conservancies and on San resettlement farms including village gardens, the harvesting and marketing of indigenous plants (e.g. Devil’s Claw) and craft production. For example in 2010, it was reported that on the three San resettlement farms in Omaheke Region supported by Desert Research Foundation of Namibia and HABITAFRICA Foundation, 104 producers were active in craft production and the total annual income was N$149,178 with an average annual income per producer of N$ 1,750. While the amount per person may look small, for the San living in the rural areas is quite substantial because food comes from the land. Most of the money would go to purchase clothes, consumer goods such as sugar, soap and salt (Werner and Odendaal <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2010</CitationRef>). In 2011, various craft production training projects took place in different regions throughout the year in order to enable San women and men produce high quality products for the national and international market.</Para>

          <Heading>Central Government Interventions</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Immense efforts have been put forward by the government of Namibia to strengthen and improve food security for the less endowed of the population as well as subsistence producers. Efforts geared towards alleviating poverty and improving food security include those already referred to above and those geared towards resettling landless people who applied for resettlement or those that the government considered as vulnerable or previously disadvantaged by the apartheid regime policies including those who were dispossessed of their ancestral lands. These people were resettled in Group Resettlement Schemes (GRS) with the expectations that they would engaged in small-scale agricultural activities to meet their food needs and where they generated some surplus, to sell and obtain cash which would be used to purchase other consumer goods. Three of these group farms, Drimiopsis, Skoonheid and Donkerbos/Sonneblom, are located in the eastern part of the country (Omaheke Region) while two, Westfalen and Bernafey, are located in the south (Hardap Region) (Desert Research Foundation of Namibia and Fundación CEAR <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2006a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">b</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">c</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Compared to other farms where large groups of people have been settled, GRS of the Ministry of Lands and Resettlement (MLR) are defined in terms of specific official membership and by the fact that some have project co-coordinators. A marked difference between the GRS in Omaheke and Hardap regions is that beneficiaries on the Drimiopsis and Skoonheid schemes are almost exclusively of San origin while the ethnic origins of those on Westfalen and Bernafey are diverse (Nama, Damara, Owambo, Kavango and Zambezan-previously Kaprivian). This difference may be explained by the fact that at the time when resettlement program was initiated up to the present, large numbers of the landless San people were found in Omaheke Region.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Another category of those who benefited from land reallocation are those who applied to be allocated land for resettlement but were expected to take up agricultural activities as small-scale commercial producers using their own resources under the Farm Unit Resettlement Scheme (FURS). Also allocated land alongside these two categories of producers is the category comprising those who qualified for bank loans to enable them to undertake agricultural production as large-scale commercial farmers under the Affirmative Action Loan Scheme (AALS). These large-scale commercial farms and the small-scale commercial producer farms offer an alternative source of income to the poor agricultural small-scale producers who get employed as farm laborers on part-time basis and a few on permanent bases leaving their allocated interests in resettlement lands in the care of their spouses or family members. In southern Namibia, where various large-scale livestock farms which also practice limited irrigated crop production, is one of the areas where this symbiotic relationship is well entrenched. In the western parts of Hardap region, small-stock predominates while the eastern part which receives a bit higher rainfall, both cattle and small stock farming is practiced. Risky crop production takes place on farms to meet own food needs but where water is available, extensive crop production takes place such as below the Hardap Dam where about 2,000 ha are being irrigated using water from the dam. Further east, just over 600 ha are being irrigated in the Auob-Stampriet area using groundwater from rich artesian reserves. These are the undertakings which offer alternative source of income in the form of labor wages to the poor small-scale producers.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In southern Namibia, unfavorable international market conditions have compelled many large-scale livestock farmers (mostly Karakul sheep farmers) to diversify out of agriculture and enter into commercial hunting and tourism. Some farmers replaced Karakul farming with mutton production by raising Dorper sheep and Boer goats instead of Karakul sheep. The change from Karakul pelt to mutton production had serious environmental and socio-economic ramifications for the farming sector in the south because grazing practices and needs of sheep bred for meat differ markedly from those of Karakul. The intake of pasturage of sheep bred for meat is generally greater than that of Karakul. Many existing farms became too small to accommodate enough “mutton sheep” to compensate for the loss of revenue following the collapse of the pelt market during early 1990s.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The socio-economic impact of this transformation is that many farmers could no longer run their farms and opted to sell. What this meant was that the small-scale agricultural producers lost part-time jobs and their ability to augment meager outputs from their small parcels of land. Evidence suggests that agricultural employment opportunities decreased rapidly; between 2002 and 2004 opportunities declined by 39 % overall while the highest decline of 80 % was in the category of temporary employment (Werner and Odendaal <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2010</CitationRef>). As well as losing jobs the poor small-scale agricultural producers also lost other opportunities such as keeping a limited number of livestock on commercial farms allowed by their employers (on average they were allowed to keep 23 small stock, 5 large stock and 3 horses or mules or donkeys). In other farms, workers were allowed to keep a maximum of 25 goats at cattle posts. With the loss of these privileges, the poor small-scale agricultural producers were compelled to move all their accumulated livestock back into communal areas which have resulted into overstocking and over grazing and subsequently environmental degradation.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Following this state of affairs, the government then initiated the two settlement schemes (GRS and FURS) to provide land to the landless which were aimed at reducing poverty and assist them contribute towards the development of the country’s economy and towards alleviating food insecurity. The government acquired previously large scale farms and allocated them to the two categories of landless people. The basic concept underlying the approach was that beneficiaries were to engage in small stock farming and practice limited dry-land crop farming for own consumption. These families were allocated land under the FURS model where they were to use the land for small-scale commercial farming. These schemes were “mainly social welfare projects providing free accommodation, food and other transfers, which displayed few signs of being resettlement projects as commonly understood”.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The National Resettlement Policy provides for two models of group resettlement: group holdings and co-operative holdings and other legal entities. The groups holdings category caters for a formal or non-formal group composed of people who cannot form a co-operative but are interested in engaging in agricultural or other production as a group. The second category caters for duly registered co-operatives or other legal entities such as companies and close corporations. Officially the Ministry of Lands and Resettlement runs 14 group resettlement projects across the country. Half of these are located in communal areas and the other half in the commercial or freehold sector. GRS projects were launched in haste after independence to accommodate large numbers of the San and returnees from exile (ex-combatants) who had no shelter, employment or other source of income. The San who were used as trackers for the colonial government during the liberation struggle were left helpless in former military camps after Namibia gained independence.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">As a result of the haste with which group resettlement projects were established, little planning went into the process. The basic concept underlying the approach was that beneficiaries were to engage in dry-land crop farming for own consumption, combined with small stock rearing and any other small-scale income-generating activities. Thus they fall into the small-scale agricultural producers’ category. At the outset, some group schemes were assisted with the procurement of farm implements and provision of drinking water in keeping with the government policy of offering support to the poorest section of beneficiaries for the first 5 year period after which they were expected to be self sustaining. However, the beneficiaries developed a dependency syndrome so that until 2008 they still expected the government to continue assisting them with land preparation costs, irrigation infrastructure, drilling boreholes, purchasing fencing materials and constructing houses. Some of the settlement schemes in this category attracted many outsiders (squatters) so that the government felt the financial strain of continuing to support growing numbers. Consequently this mode of settlement has been abandoned by MLR.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The GRS beneficiaries augment the outputs from agricultural activities through harvesting wild foods (<Emphasis Type="Italic">veldkos</Emphasis>) in the allocated farms as well as in other lands around the resettlement schemes. However due to prevalent arid conditions in and around the resettlement schemes harvesting of wild food is practiced on very small scale largely during and soon after the short rain period. The foods harvested include wild cucumber (<Emphasis Type="Italic">boesman komkommer</Emphasis> or “bushman cucumber”), <Emphasis Type="Italic">marimba</Emphasis> nuts, wild potatoes and berries. A few of these wild foods are sold or exchanged for other goods; m<Emphasis Type="Italic">arimba</Emphasis> nuts in particular are very much sought after. Traditionally, the sale of wild potatoes and <Emphasis Type="Italic">boesman komkommer</Emphasis> was prohibited, whereas <Emphasis Type="Italic">marimba</Emphasis> nuts and berries could be sold. The old people crush the nuts, boil the mulch and scoop off the fat, the taste of which is said to be as good as beef fat. This fat is very popular with the Herero people. Devil’s Claw (k<Emphasis Type="Italic">amagu</Emphasis>) is also harvested at Drimiopsis mostly for own medicinal use. Some beneficiaries risk hunting rabbits and small antelope such as steenbok and warthogs which is prohibited by law. A few beneficiaries hunt snakes and tortoises for food (Werner and Odendaal <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Hand craft production and needlework provide modest but important complementary income streams for some households at these schemes. San dances appeal to many tourists and there is a market for cultural tourism, potentially also at these group schemes. Wages earned at the neighboring farms and pension money remained the most important source of additional source of income other than what is produced at the scheme farms.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">By the end of 2000s, small-scale commercial farming or the Farm Unit Resettlement Scheme (FURS) was the most prominent component of redistributive land reform. This model entails acquiring and subdividing large-scale commercial farms, and allocating portions or units to individual beneficiaries according to allocation plans developed by land use planners in the line ministry. To qualify for resettlement, beneficiaries may not have more than 150 large-stock units (LSU) or the small-stock equivalent thereof. In 2004 the average sizes of the units allocated to FURS farmers were 2,138 ha in the southern half of the country and 1,200 ha in the more fertile northern regions. In many instances it has emerged that the size of the unit allocated to beneficiaries did not match with their productive assets such as livestock numbers. Consequently, beneficiaries were not able to utilize all of their land, and large tracts remain underutilized.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Therefore it becomes evident that the small-scale commercial resettlement model is not likely to yield expected results unless the beneficiaries are assisted with soft loans which would enable them acquire more livestock and trained in livestock management as commercial enterprises. The land redistribution program does not give small-scale commercial farmers an option to buy portions of commercial farms with financial support from government. Instead, potential land reform beneficiaries have to apply to the MLR for resettlement in response to advertisements of farms available for resettlement to the disadvantage of people with no or little education.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The majority of FURS beneficiaries applied to be resettled in order to farm with livestock. Some of these beneficiaries regarded resettlement as a means to build up their livestock farming operations, on a small-scale commercial basis while for others, resettlement meant obtaining a piece of land on which to retire in peace away from the hassles of communal area farming which is dodged with rampant stock thefts and quick spread of diseases which resulted into large stock losses. Many former farm workers regarded this as a more attractive option for retirement than a communal area as most of them had previously suffered losses due to the inability to control the movement of their livestock in communal areas. They hoped that by obtaining their own piece of land, they would be able to control their livestock, build up their herds and improve their livelihoods. A few FURS beneficiaries applied for resettlement because they were no longer able to keep their livestock on the commercial farms where they worked, but they did not want to farm on communal land.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The FURS beneficiaries have been facing several setbacks including poor social relations partly due to the way that beneficiaries were selected. The beneficiaries were not given a chance to choose their neighbors. As social issues were not considered in the land allocation process, fate alone determined who settled next to whom. Thus there was no real sense of community on most resettlement farms and when they had to co-operate on crucial farming issues requiring co-operation such as water sharing and infrastructure maintenance and repair. Water sharing is a thorny issue due to the fact that the resettlement farms were subdivided into small-scale commercial farms from a large-scale farm with single water source. As such not all allocated portions of land had their own borehole. Beneficiaries with smaller animal herds expect those with larger herds to meet larger portions of the costs. Ethnic differences sometimes also impacted negatively on social relations on these farms.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">FURS beneficiaries in Hardap primarily practiced extensive small-stock farming, while extensive cattle farming predominated in Omaheke, but all of them kept small or large stock in addition to their primary livestock herds. Small stock losses were rampant due to diseases and vermin (jackals) particularly of goat kids and sheep lambs which are highly susceptible to diseases and require good husbandry practices. The high losses of adult females are attributed to adverse weather conditions (extreme dry as well as extreme cold conditions). Dilapidated and/or non-existent farm infrastructure also impacted negatively on agricultural production. Adult small stock (goats and sheep) is also slaughtered on a regular basis for household consumption. It is common for farmers to slaughter one or two goats or sheep per month for consumption by themselves and their workers. Some of the adult small stock sold consisted of goat nannies and sheep ewes.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Marketing of small stock is usually not a major problem for FURS farmers because there are several outlets including periodic auctions and small traders who go to farms in their small pick-up trucks to purchase livestock at what they call farm gate prices which are far lower than formal market prices. This offers a solution for beneficiaries with smaller herds and hence smaller numbers for marketing who find it difficult to take their livestock to auctions on their own steam. For these sharing consignments poses challenges as not all beneficiaries necessarily want to market at the same time. Another option available to and often used by beneficiaries is selling directly to individual buyers and neighboring farmers, which gives beneficiaries the freedom to sell livestock whenever they needed to; this also is a solution to the transport huddle. Those beneficiaries located closer to auction venues tend to walk their livestock to auction centers. However, goats are sold on an informal basis when money is needed.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Another constraint facing FURS producers is lack of basic skills in general farm maintenance, animal husbandry and business management; many lack knowledge of appropriate farming practices/methods. Apart from some support provided recently by the Emerging Farmers Support Program (ECFSP) initiated in 2007, FURS beneficiaries did not receive any pre- or post-settlement support from government or any other agency. Many do not even know where to obtain specific agricultural information whenever they need it. However the issue of post-settlement support has been addressed in the MLR’s Strategic Plan 2006–2010 which treats provision of basic infrastructure and empowerment of communities as a separate strategic theme.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The strategic plan states that it is the responsibility of MLR to provide tailor-made pre- and post-settlement support packages which include technical advice, training and support in appropriate farming methods and agricultural practices. Implementation of the plan is ongoing albeit at a slow pace. Severally, resettlement farmers as well as those in communal lands have expressed a need for practical training on technical issues, and some feel that they have inadequate management knowledge and skills (Lowrens <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2004</CitationRef>; Mendelsohn <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2006</CitationRef>; Werner and Odendaal <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2010</CitationRef>). Recently established farmers have responded to this need by offering training in breeding, selection, animal husbandry, and infrastructure maintenance, supplementary feeding, rangeland management and overcoming cash-flow problems. This training is being offered under ECFSP.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">While the MLR policy stipulates that extensive livestock farming was the single most important land-based livelihood strategy prescribed for FURS beneficiaries, it is only possible where adequate rainfall is received. Here livestock farming is combined with small-scale crop cultivation for own use as well as limited sale such as in Omaheke Region, where rain-fed cultivation of maize and beans for own consumption takes place. On the other hand, in Hardap Region only very few with enough water produce crops to meet their own consumption using irrigation. Due to irrigation and marketing infrastructure constraints, the main source of income for beneficiaries remains the sale of small stock. A factor that impacts negatively on the marketing of crops is the absence of timely and organized transport arrangements. Quite often when crops are ready for marketing, transport is hard to access to get crops to markets on time. A few beneficiaries use much of the maize harvest to feed livestock while some surplus is sold at nearby markets such as in the communal areas. A few beneficiaries under the GRS have gardens in which they grow vegetables such as cabbage and carrots for household use but goat farming forms the backbone of their livelihood as it brings in more money than the garden produce.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In several cases beneficiaries combine land-based strategies with other livelihood strategies such as monthly old-age pensions which are the most important source of additional cash for FURS beneficiaries. Part-time FURS beneficiaries supplement their farming income with income from their off-farm employment and other cash generation activities such as carpentry and crafts. Many FURS beneficiaries as well as large-scale commercial farms offer employment opportunities to those settled in the neighboring GRS beneficiaries largely inhabited by the San people. Both FURS beneficiaries and the large-scale commercial farms recruit farm laborers as temporary/casual workers and in rare cases as long term employees who live in their compounds and receive a wage and other benefits like food rations.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Thus it emerges from the foregoing analysis that small stock has a very pivotal role in the food security of the small-scale agricultural producers in Namibia largely because of the climatic conditions which determine the availability and condition of the range. Namibia is largely a dry country suited to the farming of small stock such as goats and sheep. While scientific experimenting and breed genetic enquiries have identified those breeds which perform well in the rangelands of Namibia, more need to be done to improve on the productivity and specific needs and requirements of those breeds of goats and sheep that are able to withstand the prevailing climatic conditions and do well under the prevailing rangeland resources. Efforts and support to the poorer small-scale producers should be centered on the rearing and improvement of such breeds. Alternative productive activities should be sought and identified while appropriate skills should be imparted to all small-scale producers to strengthen and enhance their survival techniques.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">The group resettlement scheme offered both access to land and to a small brick house and basic services such as water. Access to land on a group scheme provided a sense of security which replaced the sense of vulnerability that most farm workers experience. In Omaheke region particularly, the schemes have served as secure places from which beneficiaries can go out to look for work and withdraw back to at the end of employment. Group resettlement schemes have also provided access to residential land for people who are not official beneficiaries by taking advantage of family ties with official beneficiaries. Those who were not allocated land initially have settled with relatives either as a temporary measure while looking for work and in a few cases permanently. Due to the ethnic homogeneity of Drimiopsis and Skoonheid, family ties among beneficiaries there are strong and have played an important role in facilitating access to resettlement without the need to apply formally (Desert Research Foundation of Namibia and Fundación CEAR <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2006b</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">c</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">An issue that begs to be answered is whether access to land through group resettlement has improved the livelihoods of the scheme beneficiaries. According to Werner and Odendaal <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2010</CitationRef>, the answer is not straightforward, particularly considering the fact that for many beneficiaries, access to land means much more than simple economic factors. For the vast majority of beneficiaries of group schemes, a major benefit of resettlement is that they have rights to a piece of land on which they have a secure home of their own. Resettlement means not only access to a piece of land, but also the provision of a small brick house with basic amenities and access to potable water. Moreover, as official beneficiaries, initially they qualified for state support, in particular food aid. However, in terms of socio-economic improvements of livelihoods in general, the group resettlement schemes have not proved successful. The vast majority of the beneficiaries have not managed to generate surpluses in the communal gardens which might have enabled them to start accumulating productive assets such as livestock. Conversely, the beneficiaries have had to sell assets including livestock in order to buy food and other basic necessities while others sold off assets and sank deeper into poverty due to excessive use of alcohol.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Group resettlements scheme villages particularly those in Omaheke accommodating mainly San beneficiaries, undoubtedly provide some protection against external shocks. While their own produce contributes towards enhancing their food security and contributes towards hunger protection, it was primarily government’s food aid programs that prevented them from starving in the beginning and in recent years donor and government donations of goats and other aid that has fortified their livelihoods. In a very profound way, Skoonheid and Drimiopsis have proven to be welfare projects more than anything else. It is prudent to point out that all of the livelihood improvements attained by land reform beneficiaries have been attained at the expense of hundreds of former farm laborers who lost their employment, their place of residence and their access to land after the state bought the applicable commercial farms. To this day, there still does not appear to be an explicit policy statement on how these previous farm workers should be compensated or incorporated into the resettlement programs.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In conclusion, it clearly emerges that there is need for the government and policy makers to revisit the issue of resettlement models for small-scale commercial farmers. Although opportunities may be limited, options other than extensive livestock farming need to be identified and pursued to enable previously disadvantaged Namibians with the requisite skills to produce more food. For example, the potential of small-scale irrigation to increase food production for own consumption and urban markets remains largely unexplored with the exception of limited effort made in recent years by MAWF to boost food security for the small-scale agricultural producers through irrigated agriculture. The Green Scheme projects which were aimed at encouraging the development of irrigation crop production in order to increase food production and create jobs have increased capacities for a few of these producers (MAWF <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Sadly, output from the Green Schemes is still negligible. Recent media reports have it that out of a total of seven Green Schemes only one, Hardap irrigation scheme has proven economically worthwhile; the other schemes are said to be causing losses to the government which acts as guarantor with Agricultural Bank of Namibia (Agribank) for the loans taken out by small-scale farmers affiliated to a Green Scheme. Some small-scale agricultural producers are said to simply default on their loans and then the government has to come through as guarantor (Namibian Sun, November 2013). Furthermore the media report criticizes all Green Scheme projects currently falling under the State with the exception of the Hardap project for failing to pay the required lease fees in accordance with their leasehold agreements, leading to even more losses for the State. The schemes in question include the Etunda, Shadikongoro and Uvhungu-Vhungu irrigation schemes. This, the reports say has led to the government losing out on its 40 % profit share following investments in land, farm infrastructure, implements, machinery and equipment.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Further, it has been suggested that for land reform to effectively reduce poverty levels and enhance food security among the small-scale agricultural producers, the needs of people categorized as “poor” must be identified much more accurately in order to develop models that properly address them. This assumes that a clear definition of poverty exists. One question that must receive careful consideration though is whether a person who is resettled with some animals falls into the same category of poverty as a person with no assets at all? What has emerged very clearly is that those who have no farming assets, or with only a few, can be resettled only with generous government support in the form of grants (Werner and Odendaal <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Furthermore, it has emerged that the welfare intervention mode is proving very costly to the government and has generated a dependency syndrome which has proven to be a hinderance of inculcating a sense of accountability and need to be self sufficient; it has undermined the quest by an individual to seek and become innovative to support oneself. Often one hears calls from the “poor” calling on the government to provide this or that instead of them coming together to look into how they can meet their own needs. This dependency syndrome must be addressed through education and campaign drives that will inculcate a sense of accountability and responsibility for own welfare.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It should be made mandatory that before land is allocated, appropriate skills training should be a prerequisite for every prospective land beneficiary. Finally, any land reform planning and post-settlement training should incorporate aspects of water resource management due to the inherent aridity characterizing the country. In line with Namibia’s various National Development Plans and the provisions of the new Water Resource Management Act of 2004 and Water and Sanitation Policy of 2008, the land reform planning and capacity-building strategies should address the need for integrated land and water management. Since land and water linkages are an important issue in all activities relating to rural development and the management of natural resources, this issue deserves a stronger and more explicit emphasis in future land reform planning and capacity-building strategies.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Over and above the foregoing, it has been recommended that better co-ordination of land reform planning is essential to avoid conflicts arising from the fact that the central government controls land allocation at regional levels which often leads to a breakdown in communication or in the flow of information required for proper planning. Partnerships between government, the private sector and civil society at regional level could effectively ensure their co-responsibility and accountability for their regional resettlement programs, and directly empower the resettlement beneficiaries to participate in planning and to manage their resources effectively. The National Resettlement Policy provides that a number of government ministries should carry a responsibility for co-coordinating action plans in a particular area to ensure that sector partners in government and NGOs are involved with these plans. For example, the MLR’s main responsibility is to finance the resettlement program while the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry is responsible for, among other things, training resettlement beneficiaries through its Directorate of Extension Services. However, it has often emerged that a lack of co-ordination and communication between these two ministries has often hindered the implementation of agricultural training programs for resettlement beneficiaries.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Training and extension service provision by Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry should be accorded equal importance for both communal and resettlement farmers. The practice has been that priority is given to communal farmers training and service provision while ministry contracts out to private contractors the provision of technical services to resettlement projects. This clearly shows that despite the government’s pledge to empower resettlement beneficiaries to become self-sufficient, the beneficiaries have to rely on external services to resolve even a minor problem. For example beneficiaries at the group schemes of Bernafey, Westfalen, Skoonheid and Drimiopsis are not allowed to repair broken equipment themselves; they have to wait for a technical team appointed by the Ministry of Land Resettlement to undertake repairs, which usually involves hiring private contractors. To avoid this cumbersome operational procedures, land reform support service systems need to be strengthened or established where they don’t exist. Of particular importance is the linking of the various information sources and the actual exchange of information within the key government institutions and their regional structures.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Similarly, financial co-operation between the government, donor organizations, the NGOs and the private sector should be directed towards supporting the development of infrastructure relating to land reform. Of particular importance are the poverty-reducing effects of infrastructure investments, and broadening and diversifying the production activities. Due to the fact that many resettlement projects are located far from big towns or trade centers, efforts should be made to ensure that these beneficiaries do not feel cut off from the rest of the country; the media and broadcasting services outlets should be made available at the schemes. Transport should also be improved because isolation obviously negatively influences the economic activities of most resettlement project communities and makes marketing of products very difficult. Supervision and assistance provision is also expensive and ineffective due to limited follow up schedules. Whatever measures are taken to improve infrastructure on the resettlement projects it has been recommended that they must include measures to improve communication and transportation infrastructure.</Para>
