          <Body>
            <Para ID="Par5">The ideas presented in this book have been brewing in our minds for several years. Before receiving funding from the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Program, we made several attempts at both the national and international levels. One could say that our proposals did not fit the current needs of the users and the market at the time and/or were too innovative. We leave this for our readers to judge.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par6">Certainly, the use of games as incentives for patients to get more involved in their rehabilitation, especially after such serious episodes as strokes has been suggested and tried already and in many different forms, as we have also indicated in this book. Using immersive user interfaces helps patients to exercise their bodies (and minds) while virtual (sometimes also augmented) reality games offer an enjoyable experience allowing users to forget for a moment about their condition. Nevertheless, they can notice significant improvements while having fun. This is the great advantage of the solution that we describe in this book.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par7">Certainly, technologies behind the StrokeBack system are not trivial. We have done extensive applied research on several levels. We advanced the performance, cost, power consumption, and miniaturization of embedded, wearable physiological and activity monitoring sensors. We developed advanced algorithms for body motion capture from diverse types of 3D depth, inertial, EMG, EEG, and other sensors. This allowed us to more reliably detect the accuracy of performing exercises so we can more consistently verify the level of limb manoeuvrability improvement. The great novelty is that the whole process can be prescribed to patients by their leading physicians just like any other prescription using online Personal Health Record (PHR) services. This allowed us to offer the means for physicians to remotely track patients’ progress and reconfigure exercises remotely, if needed. On the other hand, this also allowed patients to perform such exercises at home at their leisure.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par8">We have developed several and diverse classes of games, from simple 80s style ones to advanced 3D immersive ones that use the most advanced 3D gaming engines. This allowed us to assess and determine what types of games could be used to best effect with which types of users, respective of age, gender, and level of physical disability. Ultimately, we have produced various prototypes of integrated rehabilitation systems, both a stationary (“Smart Table” like) one and a fully portable one.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par9">At this point, we would like to thank the European Commission for offering funding for conducting this work, as part of its European Union Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007–2013) under grant agreement no. 288692-StrokeBack, and certainly the reviewers who have positively judged our proposal. We would like also to thank our EU Project Officers for their continuous support and the reviewers who took their time to go through tons of material produced in the project and gave us a lot of valuable suggestions. Our great thanks are also due to the project coordinator, Dr. Steffen Ortmann for his hard work and dedication in pushing us all to reaching the final, successful conclusion of this project.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par1">The proposed book addresses a problem of delivering a cost-effective and efficient means of recovery from Strokes, a disease with very high socio-economic impact. The Public Health Care spends on average 3 % of their entire healthcare expenditure for dealing with effects of strokes across different countries in Europe and the USA. This includes inpatient treatment cost, outpatient hospital visits, and long-term rehabilitation and care. Analysis show that costs of long-term care have increased from 13 to 49 % of overall costs in average in recent years. Therefore, devising an effective long-term care and rehabilitation strategy for Stroke patients, actively involving patients in the process while minimizing costly human intervention becomes a matter of urgency.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par2">A new approach enabling people suffering from mild cases of stroke to recover their motor, and to some level also their mental, capabilities has been developed in the StrokeBack project, partially funded by the European Commission through its FP7 Research Framework, where an automated remote rehabilitation system blending advances in ICT and practical clinical knowledge empowers patients and their immediate care providers and family members to support effective application of the rehabilitation protocol in their familiar home settings instead of cold clinical environments.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par3">Such a system combines the state-of-the-art monitoring devices forming a wireless Body Area Network that enable simultaneous measurement of multiple vital parameters and currently executed movements that are of particular interest from the point of view of effective rehabilitation. The measured parameters are fused using advanced feature extraction and classification algorithms processed on-body, which will denote the accuracy of the executed exercise. The training parameters along with vital data will be stored in a patient health record to which the responsible clinicians and therapists have access so that they can dynamically update the rehabilitation program. By employing manual intervention only when actually necessary, it eliminates costly human intervention and thereby significantly reduces associated costs of the Public Health Care services. The increased rehabilitation speed as well as the fact that the rehabilitation training can be done at home directly improves the quality of life of patients, while gaming technologies increase the effectiveness by combining medical training with entertainment and desire for self-improvement.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par4">The StrokeBack system combines a range of state-of-the-art technologies from augmented/virtual reality gaming environments combined with immersive user interfaces for delivering mixed reality training environment, advanced embedded microsensor devices with increased power autonomy by exploiting latest Bluetooth Smart communication interfaces, all integrated under the umbrella of Personal Health Record (PHR) platform allowing to deliver personalized, patient-centric medical services whether it is at home, in clinic or on the move.</Para>
