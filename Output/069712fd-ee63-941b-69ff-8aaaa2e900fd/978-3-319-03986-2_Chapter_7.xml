          <Para TextBreak="No">The theoretical perspective in medical sociology continues with the discussion of the interpretive paradigm, a microsociological approach in the study of health. In this first part, a number of microsociological substantive models from social psychology and sociocultural research are presented. After the examination of the basic features and methodological implications of the interpretive perspective, Max Weber’s classical theories are presented, including Weberian social action theory (this is an application of classical sociological theory of social action to explain care and support) and Weber’s Bureaucratic Rationality (this also represents the application of classical theory of Weber to the explanation of organisation of health care). Other substantive theories presented include the health belief model (HBM), a model developed from social psychology to explain health-related behaviours; theory of planned behaviour (TPB), a theory also developed from social psychology to predict behaviour in general, but is now consistently used for health-related behaviours; Suchman’s stages of illness behaviour, a microsociological approach of illness behaviour built on the sick role model; and Andersen’s model of health services utilisation, which includes a number of macro issues influencing health services utilisation.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">The interpretivists/interactionists argued that the so-called objective facts are not external or coercive of human action or behaviour. The subjective conditions are non-structures and do not have a deterministic impact on social existence. Therefore, human action and behaviours are not effects of certain deterministic conditions; rather they are hinged on voluntary volition based on understanding, meaning, and interpretation attached to social events. Specifically, while the structuralists believe in determinism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Determinism</Primary>

            </IndexTerm> in human responses to similar conditions. This is a seemingly opposing view to the notion of the <Emphasis Type="Italic">mechanical man</Emphasis> who plays a passive role in the society. The implication is that individuals are actively involved in the social construction of social realities whether there are social constraints or opportunities.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In addition, the interactionists focus on the microscopic level of analysis. The microscopic level consists of social processes at the subjective level which are relatively small in size, such as individual actors, actions, behaviour, attitude, motives, gestures, perception, thoughts, and interaction. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">subjective</Emphasis> occurs solely in the realm of ideas (Foucault <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">1970</CitationRef>; Ritzer <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm>. The proponents do not really have the motive to generalise or provide a universal explanation that is applicable to all individuals. Since reality is socially constructed, it is highly relative and therefore the idea of grand narrative (universal laws governing human nature) is greatly contestable and most times infeasible. What, then, are the methodological implications of this nominalist philosophical foundation?</Para>

            </IndexTerm> are not viewed as <Emphasis Type="Italic">things</Emphasis> that are external and have determining effects, this negates the cause-effect assumption in science. Hence the nominalists employ a methodology that is less scientifically rigorous. In fact, they are often referred to as anti-positivists. It should be noted that anti-positivism does not mean a total opposition to science. The nominalists are more flexible in their approach. The major method is rooted in what Weber (<CitationRef CitationID="CR45">1949</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR46">1978</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

This is why the interpretivists mostly rely on qualitative research design, an approach that is more appropriate in studying micro or subjective realities such as action, behaviour, motives, gestures, interaction, and other microsocial realities. The qualitative approach<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Social interaction explains the connection individuals have in society and the capacity to interact, interpret, and make meanings to define the social nature of human beings.

            </IndexTerm>. Social positions are not fixed but rather are fluid and changeable. Through interaction, people are involved in the process of negotiation and renegotiation of social events and, consequently, role taking.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The interpretivists view illness experience as subjective and it requires deeper understanding if there must be sound intervention. The social interaction that takes place between the physician and the patient provides an avenue for the physician to have objective and, more importantly, subjective knowledge of disease condition. It also provides an opportunity to gain knowledge of the patients’ views of illness condition. Lay perspective or explanatory models are vital for effective evaluation and intervention. The interpretivists also explain that illness itself and accompanying responses are socially constructed. An illness is thus not a real condition but is defined by the society as such. This implies that illness categories are created; people are defined as ill through the process of social interaction. For instance, HIV/AIDS<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is defined as a dreadful disease with life-threatening consequences. In addition, mental illness is associated with stigma that affects social interaction in many societies. All of these definitions are not fixed but are relative from one society to another and are subject to change through gradual understanding and redefinition. For example, obesity<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Obesity</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is gradually assuming a disease status in many non-western societies (especially in many African countries) where it was not previously defined as such.</Para>

          <Heading>The Weberian Social Action Theory</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Max Weber (1864–1920), a German sociologist, political economist, and philosopher, is often referred to as the father of interpretive sociology<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Social action theory</Primary>
              <Secondary>Weberian</Secondary>

In his classical works, especially <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Methodology of the Social Sciences</Emphasis> (first published in 1903 and later in 1949) and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology</Emphasis> (first published in 1921 and later in 1978), Weber devoted attention to the explanation of sociology as an interpretive social science. Weber (<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">1978</CitationRef>, p. 4)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Weber, M.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> defined sociology as “a science concerning itself with the interpretive understanding of social action<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Secondary>definition</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm> and thereby with a causal explanation of its course and consequences.” Weber used the German word <Emphasis Type="Italic">verstehen</Emphasis>

              <Primary>Verstehen</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, meaning <Emphasis Type="Italic">understanding</Emphasis>, as the methodological approach in sociology. He claimed that sociologists should capitalise on and utilise the advantage they have over natural scientists; that advantage resides in the sociologists’ ability to <Emphasis Type="Italic">understand</Emphasis> social phenomena—action, behaviour, and the actor (himself/herself), whereas the natural scientists could not gain a similar understanding of the behaviour of an atom or other inanimate objects (Ritzer <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2011</CitationRef>, p. 116)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Ritzer, G.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Weber observed that understanding involves the interpretive grasp of the meaning embedded in social realities. By implication, there is a need to understand how illness categories are constructed, as well as subsequent illness experiences and responses by the actors. This will then allow for interpretation of meaning and their implications for social existence and health interventions. Weber (<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">1978</CitationRef>, p. 5)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Weber, M.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> clarified that all interpretation of meaning, like all scientific observations, “strives for clarity and verifiable accuracy of insight and comprehension.” He observed that understanding could be direct observational or explanatory understanding.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The field of medical sociology provides an opportunity to apply this understanding, interpretive grasp of meaning based on observations and explanations as proposed by Weber. While Weber was not particularly interested in medical sociology, he was one of those who laid the foundation for the conceptualisation of sociology itself, methodology, and research directions in the field. Very often, Weber’s social action theory has been adapted for the understanding of social capital in population health, and as the bureaucratic ideal type<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Ideal type</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> for the understanding of medical organisation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Secondary>Weberian</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm>.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Weber’s theory of social action is sometimes referred to as the “Action Frame of Reference.” Weber was preoccupied with the possibility of analysing human actions and relationships scientifically (Abraham and Morgan <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2004</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Abraham, F.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>
            <IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Morgan, J.H.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. It is further observed that Weber’s primary focus was on the subjective meanings that human actors attach to their actions in their mutual orientations within a specific sociohistorical context. Weber argued that the explanation of social affairs has to account for the way in which individuals attach subjective meanings to situations and direct their actions in accordance with their perception of those situations (Burrell and Morgan <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">1979</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Burrell, G.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>
            <IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Morgan, G.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. The individuals interpret and define the situation, and then act accordingly. This also signifies that behaviours are moulded within the socio-spatial setting. Human predisposition and cultural frame are exclusive functions of our mutual orientation. Hence perception of diseases or illness is a product of the sociocultural realm. This leads to the relativity of the sociocultural milieu that explains differentials in the local understanding of illness within and across cultures.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The major deduction from Weber’s approach is that human action is social in nature because of the meaning attached to it—be it overt or covert and omission or acquiescence. Human action is <Emphasis Type="Italic">social</Emphasis> “insofar as, by virtue of the subjective meaning attached to it by the acting individual, it takes account of the behaviour of others and is thereby oriented in its course” (Weber <CitationRef CitationID="CR46">1978</CitationRef>, p. 4)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Weber, M.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. A <Emphasis Type="Italic">meaning</Emphasis> is the rationalised reason advanced by individuals as explanation for a specific action. Hence Weber asserted that the absence of assigned meaning by the individual makes the action meaningless. This contextual framework explains the intricacies in societal responses to disease and illness. The kind of actions taken by individuals in the management of ill-health depends on the sociocultural milieu. This refers to a sociohistorical context of health-seeking behaviour.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Practically, the foregoing discussion implies that human behaviour or action could be divergent in different social spaces. This behaviour or action is clearly relatable to health, first in terms of its local understanding which leads to a specific response from the individual and by extension the society at large. Weber (<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">1978</CitationRef>, p. 22)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Weber, M.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> noted that “social action includes both failure to act and passive acquiescence, and is often oriented to the past, present, or expected future behaviour of others.” “Others” in this sense could be given extended interpretation to include social institutions such as medical institutions. This explains that health and illness behaviours as well as non-participation in either of them can be explained within the limits of personal and relational understanding<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

It is for this reason that both knowledge of available means and perceived efficacy of action play an important role in an individual’s determination of what course of action to take in managing illness.

The genesis of Weber’s discussion of bureaucracy started with his theoretical precept called the ideal type. Weber argued that one of the primary drives of sociology should be the construction of an ideal type, a kind of conceptual purity or perfection. This implies the provision of a utopian definition and attributes of sociological categories to serve as reference points in observational or explanatory analysis.</Para>

              </IndexTerm>, then called the new framework a theory of planned behaviour. The TPB was developed from social psychology. It also has a link with interpretive sociology because it focuses on micro or subjective phenomena. This is why it is often adopted in medical sociology to explain health-related behaviour. The theory presents another approach in studying beliefs and health behaviour. Both the HBM and TPB are expectancy theory–based models, but there is a key difference. The TPB includes the consideration of social influence<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Social influence</Primary>

It is a self-responsibility approach in health behaviour—that individuals form their response based on personal evaluation of beliefs and responsive options. Actors then act as rational beings by selecting appropriate responses in terms of health and illness behaviour.

The three determinants are strongly connected to behavioural beliefs—the belief that an individual has about the consequences of a particular behaviour which helps to mould an attitude towards that behaviour.

Such a belief might inform the expectations about the experience of pain, pleasure, regret, fear, elation, or other emotions. Both positive and negative expectations influence the nature of attitude. If there is a strong expectation that a particular behaviour is useful, positive, effective, and highly recommended, there is a greater possibility of developing a positive attitude<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The subjective norm is then a personal evaluation and exhibition of the normative beliefs based on understanding and level of acceptability. An individual can form a subjective norm as perceived social pressure.

                <RefTarget Address="10.1007/978-3-319-03986-2_3#Sec11" TargetType="DOI"/>
              </ExternalRef>). The model has since become one of the major conceptual frameworks for many studies. The model is an advancement of the sick role model by Parsons. The primary concern of Suchman was to explain illness experience and medical care. Then, he described and analysed five major stages of illness that show critical transition and decision-making points in medical care and behaviour. Suchman (<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">1965</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Suchman, E.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> grounded the stages of illness experience by distinguishing four principal elements: (a) the content, (b) the sequence, (c) the spacing, and (d) the variability of behaviour during different phases of medical care. Before describing the stages, Suchman introduced a number of terms to describe the content and variability of illness behaviour.</Para>

              <Heading>The Symptom Experience Stage</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Illness experience means the feeling of pain, discomfort, or any form of abnormality. This implies that there is a perception that something is definitely wrong. It is through this experience that the patient can define himself or herself as ill or unhealthy. This stage is critical because the experience depends on physical, emotional, or mental indications. It also depends on the ability to recognise the signs and symptoms of ill-health. The experience of illness may also reflect the severity of the illness. A patient may consider illness as serious or mild. This also considers the patient’s knowledge of the symptoms of the disease or illness. It is important to note that Suchman is particular here about symptomatic disease or illness. Apart from the physical dimension, Suchman (<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">1965</CitationRef>, p. 114)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Suchman, E.</Primary>
                </IndexTerm> observed that the cognitive aspect is very important because it involves the interpretation and derived meaning for the individual experiencing the symptoms. It is further observed that this stage also involves an emotional response, or the fear or anxiety of perceived threats (in HBM), which may be attached to the physical experience and cognitive interpretation. The variability in the experience of symptoms often functions to initiate the patient into the medical care process and explains why some may not seek medical care. The variability also informs the selection of a care provider, whether in the traditional or modern care system. Suchman noted that three aspects of decision-making may be indicated at this stage: denial of illness<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                </IndexTerm> by stipulating that it is left to the patient to accept the diagnosis and accept the recommended course of treatment or continue to search for alternative explanations. He stressed that, in the case of a non-acceptance of the diagnosis and recommendations, this stage could be prolonged. This prolongation is due to repetition of activities—another diagnosis and recommendation probably by another care provider in another health facility or because of shopping<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Shopping</Primary>
                </IndexTerm>. It is also noted that the selection of care depends on a number of factors, including access to care and other conveniences.

                  <Primary>Patienthood</Primary>
                </IndexTerm>. Acceptance of the course of treatment also means acceptance of the social and physical adjustments and perhaps pains involved in the treatment process.

                </IndexTerm>. The patient has to accept medical instructions regarding medication and activities to ensure effectiveness of the therapeutic regimen. Suchman noted that the care process might lead to conflict<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                </IndexTerm>. Suchman noted that the return to a normal role is easy in cases of acute illness, but some difficulties may prevail in cases of chronic illness or physical impairment. In fact, in some cases, an individual may require a period of grace before returning to his/her normal role, while in some others an individual may never return to normal roles again.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Suchman also observed that some demographic characteristics such as age<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                </IndexTerm>, sex, and income might determine an individual’s response to illness. This implies that variation in the stages in terms of sequence and content may be due to some of these personal attributes. The model also has some practical applications: it is important for a care provider to understand the patient’s complaints, point of view, and experience of illness; the physician needs to consider whether the patient has <Emphasis Type="Italic">shopped</Emphasis> before coming to a particular care facility; understand and prioritise the needs of the patients; minimise inconveniences during patient-dependent role; and so on. As a microsociological model, it has been widely applied, but it also suffers some criticisms similar to those of its microanalytic counterparts previously examined.</Para>

              </IndexTerm> presented another conceptual model to explain the utilisation of health services. The model was first developed to understand why families use health services and examine equitable access to such services (Andersen <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">1968</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Andersen, R.M.</Primary>

Since then, the model has undergone a lot of modifications with the incorporation of more variables. Andersen (<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">1995</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
