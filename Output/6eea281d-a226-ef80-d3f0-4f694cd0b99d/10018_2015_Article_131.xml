              <Para ID="Par1">This paper brings together recent conceptual and empirical contributions, to provide new analytical foundations of systemic public policies for the transition towards the green economy. In particular, by acknowledging the inherent complexity of system dynamics, the paper argues that the green transformation of the economies can be conceptualized as the outcome of an emergent system property. In this context, the paper highlights the difficulties related to the development of an integrated framework of policy instruments and the necessity to take into account their mutual interaction in the effort of favoring sustainable transition. Some examples of possible contrasting effects between policies that are crucial for sustaining the transition towards the green economy: innovation policy, environmental and energy policies, and labor policies are discussed. Finally, the paper elaborates on the concept of Green Transition System, suggesting the importance of activating learning and adaptive mechanisms involving private agents, stakeholders, policy makers and scholars interested and involved in the transition process.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par2">The analysis of transition towards the green economy, the issues related to the emergence and diffusion of environmental technologies and of the co-evolving socio-economic, institutional and policy contexts are gaining growing relevancy in the current academic and policy debate. In particular, the role of public policies and governance systems is under scrutiny so as to understand how to ensure the conditions for fostering economic development while protecting the environment (OECD <CitationRef CitationID="CR61">2010</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR62">2011</CitationRef>). In this context, environmental goals are increasingly intertwined with economic goals as the concept of sustainable development itself implies. The notion of sustainable development in fact looks simultaneously in different directions: development on the one side and environment on the other, something that can appear as inherently contradictory and irreconcilable (Kates et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">2005</CitationRef>). The introduction of more stringent environmental regulations has been in fact traditionally seen as potentially harmful for productivity and competitiveness of industries as it leads to higher costs faced by firms (Brock and Taylor <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2005</CitationRef>; Copeland and Taylor <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2004</CitationRef>). Only if environmental policies are capable of inducing firms to generate innovations in products and processes that positively affect the dynamic efficiency of the economy, environmental goals may become compatible with growth promotion and competitiveness (Porter and van der Linde <CitationRef CitationID="CR65">1995</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par3">Despite these potential contradictions, the ongoing economic and financial crisis has engendered increasing attention towards a broadly defined transition to the green economy as a powerful mechanism to escape from the current downturn, especially in the European Union context. This implies that not only environmental objectives should be achieved without harming economic competitiveness, productivity and economic growth, but also that the framework of policies designed to promote environmental sustainability should be able to sustain economic recovery and employment growth. To reach these objectives, a roadmap for the development and diffusion of environmental-friendly technologies combined with a coherent and effective governance framework for the achievement of both environmental and economic goals is widely acknowledged as necessary (European Commission <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">2011a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">b</CitationRef>; EEA <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">2013</CitationRef>). In this respect, within an international policy framework that suffers from lack of coordination, the EU has led the way in setting targets—such as the Lisbon agenda and the 20–20–20 strategy on energy, CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> and renewable energies. Moreover, the launch of Horizon 2020 is expected to provide new stimuli for the transition towards a resource efficient, low carbon and more competitive and inclusive economy (European Commission <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">2011a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">b</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par4">Though such steps are important, the real outcome of this process is far from being clear for several reasons. First, the compliance with the Lisbon agenda has been poor and although the Kyoto targets have been achieved, this was mainly due to the ongoing crisis (Borghesi <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2011</CitationRef>), and it is not clear whether the 20–20–20 targets will be achieved when the economy eventually recovers from the recession. Second, the link between environmental policy and eco-innovation is still at the center of economic debate which showed that the drivers of innovations in environmental technologies are multifaceted and touch upon various spheres of society and policy-making (Horbach et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR40">2012</CitationRef>; Costantini and Crespi <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2008</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2013</CitationRef>). Only properly designed policies can spur eco-innovations when firms believe that innovation offsets are greater than regulatory costs (Costantini and Mazzanti <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">2012</CitationRef>). Third, the interpretation of environmental and economic consequences due to the introduction and adoption of new environmental technologies is not unambiguous. With respect to the former issue, for instance, on the one hand new technologies can favor the reduction of carbon emissions and the usage of energy, on the other hand, gains in the efficiency of energy consumption will result in an effective reduction in the per unit price of energy services, leading to increasing consumption of energy services (i.e., “rebound” effect), partially offsetting the impact of the efficiency gain in fuel use (Greening et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR36">2000</CitationRef>). Regarding the economic effects, the actual dimension of the macroeconomic impact of eco-innovations is still unclear. In particular, the net employment effects of new environmental technologies and sustainable transition is currently under scrutiny as the outcome of a process of creative destruction in which both job creation and job destruction are jointly operating (Horbach et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR40">2012</CitationRef>). Finally, the impact of the recent economic crisis on the pace and geographical distribution of sustainable transition could have been relevant, though largely unexplored. The sharp decrease in economic activity levels may have lowered the incentives to accelerate green transition, as it contributed to lower oil prices and to reduce the dynamics of emissions (Borghesi <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2011</CitationRef>). On the other hand, the economic crisis has negatively affected innovative investments in certain geographical areas (e.g., in Europe), which may translate into a reduction of the pace of technological change, potentially delaying the emergence of a new green technological system (Archibugi et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par5">These considerations draw attention to the complexity of the issues at stake and to the need for developing a broad analytical and policy framework for governing the transition towards the green economy by achieving both environmental and economic goals. The aim of this paper is then to highlight such complexity and the importance of adopting a systemic perspective for the analysis of sustainable transition to better identify the challenges related to the transition governance and possibly identify useful tools to deal with this complexity. In so doing, building on the literature on complex systems dynamics (Anderson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">1988</CitationRef>; Arthur et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">1997</CitationRef>; Lane et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2009</CitationRef>; Antonelli and Ferraris <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2011</CitationRef>; Antonelli <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2011</CitationRef>; Harper and Lewis <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2012</CitationRef>), it will be argued that the green transformation of the economy can be conceived as the possible outcome of an emergent system property that takes place if and when there is an appropriate matching between the properties of the system and the characteristics and behaviors of individual agents. In this context, the organization of the system plays a key role as it shapes the process of transition, where the system conditions are the crucial and complementary pillars to drive the emergence of the green transformation of the economies.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par6">The elaboration on the complexity of transition processes allows us to understand the green transformation of the economies as a process shaped and explained by the interactions between the individual agents and the organization and structure of the economic system. In this framework, it is clear that systems can succeed or fail in achieving a sustainable transition because of their intrinsic characteristics including their structure and architectures. Hence, policy actions aimed at increasing the quality of transition systems can represent an effective way to support and assist the interactions between agents and spurring the sustainable transformation of the economies.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par7">The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. Section <InternalRef RefID="Sec2">2</InternalRef> analyses the theoretical and policy implications of shifting the focus of policy action from market to system failures. Section <InternalRef RefID="Sec3">3</InternalRef> offers some examples of policy interactions between the domains of environmental and energy policies, innovation and labor policies. Paragraph 4 elaborates on the notion of Green Transition Systems, while, Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec8">5</InternalRef>, provides some summary conclusions.</Para>

              <Heading>System failures and the governance of sustainable transition</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par8">The traditional foundations of environmental policy relates to the correction of market failures by changing the incentives of private sector agents. Market failures may be directly responsible for environmental issues generating sub-optimal equilibria due to externality problems (Baumol and Oates <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">1988</CitationRef>). In the same perspective, market failures may also limit the generation of new technologies because of the public good nature of knowledge and the related problems of appropriability (Nelson <CitationRef CitationID="CR55">1959</CitationRef>; Arrow <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">1962</CitationRef>). Hence, market failures may also limit the possibility to solve environmental problems through the development of new environmental technologies designed to reduce the environmental impact of economic activities.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par9">Recently, a significant body of literature has emphasized the shortcomings of the standard normative economic theory of both environmental policy and innovation policy in guiding policy-makers in the design and implementation of effective policy tools, with relevant implications for the issues related to the achievement of sustainable development objectives. In particular, a growing body of economic literature suggested that traditional economic approaches are inappropriate for dealing with the dynamics of structural and adaptive changes in economic systems (Rammel and van der Bergh <CitationRef CitationID="CR66">2003</CitationRef>), while highlighting the potential of evolutionary economics to interpret the process of sustainable development and environmental policies (Kemp <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">1997</CitationRef>; van den Bergh and Gowdy <CitationRef CitationID="CR76">2000</CitationRef>; van der Berg et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR77">2007</CitationRef>; Nill and Kemp <CitationRef CitationID="CR59">2009</CitationRef>). According to these contributions, an evolutionary foundation of sustainable development policies should account for concepts such as adaptive behavior, policy learning, policy interactions, diversity, path-dependence and lock-in. Such an approach takes advantage of the relevant lessons emerging from the systemic approach in innovation studies. In particular, innovation policy analyses within an Innovation Systems framework (Freeman <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">1987</CitationRef>; Lundvall <CitationRef CitationID="CR48">1988</CitationRef>; Nelson <CitationRef CitationID="CR56">1993</CitationRef>; Edquist <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">1997</CitationRef>) radically challenged the market failure rationale for government intervention to promote the development and diffusion of new technologies (Bleda and del Río <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2013</CitationRef>). In the innovation system approach, innovation is conceived as a complex evolutionary process distributed in a system of different agents whose behavior and interactions are governed both by market forces and by non-market institutions (Metcalfe and Ramlogan <CitationRef CitationID="CR54">2005)</CitationRef>
                     </Para>
              <Para ID="Par10">Agents’ interactions and the institutions governing them determine the innovative performance of the system. Hence, the problems affecting performance to be tackled by policy action are mainly associated with coordination problems arising from these interactive behaviors. The systemic framework opens up a new perspective for policy-making in general and, more specifically, for the design of an appropriate policy structure to foster the transition towards the green economy. Systemic thinking implies to embed policies in a broader institutional context, and to shift the policy perspective from a top–down view to a network steering approach. In a systemic setting, governments have to deal not only with ‘market failures’, but also most importantly with ‘system failures’ (Metcalfe <CitationRef CitationID="CR52">1995</CitationRef>), namely with problems related to the interactive behavior of agents operating in the system and the institutions designed for its governance (Edquist <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">1997</CitationRef>; Metcalfe <CitationRef CitationID="CR53">2005</CitationRef>). Moreover, in this context, policy-making is part of and subject to system failures entailing a process of adaptive and learning policy-making, thus acknowledging the challenges of state intervention in a context of economic and policy complexity (Metcalfe <CitationRef CitationID="CR52">1995</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par11">Policy-makers, scholars and analysts increasingly focus on challenges stemming from policy complexity, and this appears to be particularly relevant when dealing with the issue of sustainable development. As already stated the framework of policies designed to promote the transition towards the green economy should be able to achieve environmental goals as well as sustaining technological competitiveness, economic recovery and employment growth as interrelated objectives. In this perspective, a radical shift from classical models of economic policy towards a systemic perspective appears to be needed. The former emphasizes the clear distinction between different policy goals as implied by the golden rule of having as many instruments as policy goals (Tinbergen <CitationRef CitationID="CR73">1952</CitationRef>), while the latter focuses on the interactions and interdependencies between different policies, and highlights how such interactions affect the extent to which policy goals are realized.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par12">This shift is exemplified by the increasing interest in the concept of ‘policy mix’ which, not surprisingly, registered an early diffusion and development within the literature on environmental policy and regulation (Sorrel and Sijm <CitationRef CitationID="CR72">2003</CitationRef>). In recent years, several scholars in fields related to the analysis of eco-innovation (Kemp <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">1997</CitationRef>; Rennings <CitationRef CitationID="CR67">2000</CitationRef>) have focused their attention on the design of policy mix which combines several policy instruments, including environmental policy (OECD <CitationRef CitationID="CR60">2007</CitationRef>; IEA <CitationRef CitationID="CR41">2011</CitationRef>) and innovation policy (Flanagan et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">2011</CitationRef>). According to this literature, policy instruments must be designed carefully and on the basis of a system perspective, so that they are combined into mixes in ways that address the complex problems related to the sustainable transition process. In particular, the choice of instruments is a crucial decision regarding the formulation of policy design. This concerns three main dimensions: first, a selection of the specific instruments among the array of different possible instruments; second, the actual calibration of the instruments for the context in which they are supposed to operate; and third, the choice of a policy mix, or set of different and complementary policy instruments, to address the problems identified. Hence, the choice of instruments has to consider their individual characteristics, their potential complementarities and the trade-offs between different policies in relation to the specific mix adopted (Borrás and Edquist <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par13">While this stream of studies appears to be relevant for highlighting the complexity associated to the design of policy mix, it does not fully address some important aspects: first, these studies mostly concentrate on the achievement of environmental goals and to the generation and diffusion of environmental technologies as means to realize these objectives; in so doing, they still limitedly incorporate in their analyses the further policy complexity introduced with the integration of environmental objectives with economic, and in particular employment objectives as a consequence of the economic crisis; moreover, policy mix studies tend to be limited to examining instrument interactions (Rogge and Reichardt <CitationRef CitationID="CR69">2013</CitationRef>; Del Río <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2009</CitationRef>; IEA <CitationRef CitationID="CR41">2011</CitationRef>) or the policy processes associated with designing policy mixes (Kallis and van den Bergh <CitationRef CitationID="CR42">2013</CitationRef>); finally the aspects mentioned above may lead to an insufficient understanding of the complex nature of policy mixes and their effects, potentially resulting in oversimplified policy recommendations generically suggesting the need of enhancing consistency and coherence of the policy mix (Rogge and Reichardt <CitationRef CitationID="CR69">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par14">An inadequate understanding of policy complexity may erroneously lead to see policy co-ordination as the unproblematic outcome of a superior governance system, implicitly assuming a single level of governance managed by a fully rational policy maker (Flanagan et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">2011</CitationRef>; Kallis and van den Bergh <CitationRef CitationID="CR42">2013</CitationRef>). In contrast, co-ordination can at best be the outcome of a mutual adaptive process between actors and systems. In this context, the analysis of interactions and trade-offs between policy instruments and their impacts on the ultimate policy objectives is crucial for fruitfully develop and operationalize the concepts of policy mix and policy coordination. To this purpose, the next paragraph provides examples of potential trade-offs arising from the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable growth.</Para>

                <Para ID="Par15">In the energy sector, there is a strong need for regulatory strategies to force technological regime shifts. In this sector, network economies emerge due to the strong interrelations between technological systems and users, thus producing a continued refinement of the dominant design, which can define a technological trajectory typically affected by lock-in and path-dependence effects (Unruh <CitationRef CitationID="CR74">2000</CitationRef>). In particular, a carbon lock-in seems to be particularly difficult to discard, where progress in environmental-friendly technologies should be supplemented by changes in consumer behavior and the institutional framework (Unruh <CitationRef CitationID="CR74">2000</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR75">2002</CitationRef>). The peculiar characteristics of the energy sector, explain the coexistence of several different public policies that aim to escape the carbon lock-in. Nonetheless, in the absence of strong coordination between different public policies implemented in the energy sector, contrasting forces and impacts can negatively affect the final outcome of the adopted policy mix.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par16">The diffusion of carbon-free energy forms and energy-saving technologies is a typical example of the necessary coexistence of alternative solutions to fossil fuel energies. This is evident when energy policies claim to pursue a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and an improvement in security of energy supply (Costantini et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">2007</CitationRef>). This double outcome should be found in relation to policies supporting both energy efficiency and the production of renewable energy. However, policies that target renewables may not be helpful for the achievement of objectives in terms of increasing energy efficiency. More specifically, instruments other than the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) have been found to frequently negatively interact with ETS as they are not aligned to it. According to this view, the use of policy tools different from ETS has increased the cost of climate change policies and left a very low carbon price (Borghesi <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2011</CitationRef>). In particular, policies for renewable energies substantially contributed to the declining trend of emission permits prices and to reduce incentives for investments aimed at decreasing emissions for unit of produced energy from traditional plants. Hence, in the energy sector the contemporaneous presence of many different policy instruments represents a critical issue for the design of an appropriate policy mix and the effective achievement of environmental and technological goals (Abrell and Weigt <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2008</CitationRef>; Böhringer et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Deployment policies and technology exploration</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par17">The literature provided large evidence on the relevance of both demand-pull and technology-push instruments in shaping the dynamics of eco-innovation (see for instance Del Río <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2009</CitationRef>; Horbach et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR40">2012</CitationRef>; Newell <CitationRef CitationID="CR58">2010</CitationRef>; Rennings <CitationRef CitationID="CR67">2000</CitationRef>). However, a crucial issue is represented by the balance between the two categories of instruments in the policy mix and the differentiated effects with respect to the dynamics of environmental innovation at different stages of technological and commercial maturity, and with respect to the different types of innovative activities (Hoppmann et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR38">2013</CitationRef>; Nemet <CitationRef CitationID="CR57">2009</CitationRef>; Sagar and van der Zwaan <CitationRef CitationID="CR71">2006</CitationRef>). In particular, it has been claimed that public financial resources invested in demand-pull measures aimed at stimulating the deployment of renewable technologies (like those related to photovoltaic and wind energy) largely exceed investments in R&amp;D supply policies (Laleman and Albrecht <CitationRef CitationID="CR46">2014</CitationRef>). Such an unbalanced structure of public budgets in favor of deployment policies has been criticized as it may impose high costs to the community without producing the expected positive impacts in terms of technological and environmental achievements, which could be more fruitfully pursued by directly funding R&amp;D activities (Frondel et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR33">2008</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para ID="Par18">Moreover, the growth of markets associated with the implementation of deployment policies may create disincentive for the development of non-incremental innovation, which are required for developing cost efficient environmental technologies. In the case of wind energy, it has been shown that radical innovations do not positively respond to demand stimuli, but, conversely, appear to be fostered by technology-push forces (Nemet <CitationRef CitationID="CR57">2009</CitationRef>). Hence, a strong focus on deployment policies may direct innovation activities towards exploitation rather than exploration, which may lead to a reduction in the pace of radical innovations and to increasing risks for the system to get stuck in technological lock-ins.</Para>

                <Heading>The employment effects of eco-innovation</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par19">As already mentioned, the willingness to invest public resources on the transition to the low-carbon economy also reflects the opinion that such a transformation is likely to increase employment levels at a time of high involuntary unemployment due to the effects of the current economic crisis. Renewable energy industries appear to be more labor intensive than the existing energy sector and a shift from high-carbon to low-carbon activities is expected to lead to net job creation (Fankhauser et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2008</CitationRef>). However, the employment impact of flows of environmental innovations induced by policy actions is far to be clear. Though recent attention has been placed by scholars on the theme (Horbach <CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2010</CitationRef>; Gagliardi et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">2014</CitationRef>), the employment effects of innovations have been studied extensively outside the green economy paradigm. Such studies showed that technological change plays a major role in shaping the quantity and quality of employment. Firm-level studies have shown that innovations in products and in processes generally lead to a positive direct employment effect on the firms that introduce them. Innovative firms tend to increase jobs faster than non-innovative ones. However, sectoral analyses highlighted that innovation appears to have a net job-creating effect in those manufacturing and service industries characterized by high demand growth and an orientation towards product innovation, whereas new processes generally result in job losses (Vivarelli et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR78">1996</CitationRef>; Pianta <CitationRef CitationID="CR63">2001</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR64">2005</CitationRef>; Mastrostefano and Pianta <CitationRef CitationID="CR49">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para ID="Par20">When the specific effects of eco-innovations have been addressed it has been found that, while product or service eco-innovation has a significantly positive effect on the probability of an increase in employment, end-of pipe innovations tend to favor employment decrease (Rennings et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR68">2004</CitationRef>). This result is confirmed by Horbach et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR40">2012</CitationRef>), who highlight that the relationship between eco-innovation and employment within a firm strongly depends on the nature of innovation, especially between process and product innovation. Hence, as the introduction and diffusion of eco-innovations entail both job creation and job destruction effects, in the design of policy mix it is crucial to take into account the potential contrasting effects between environmental, technological and employment objectives.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par21">Moreover, the impact of eco-innovation on the quality of jobs, the skills and competences required, is another most relevant aspect to consider. The availability of dedicated skills for green jobs plays in fact a crucial role in triggering change and facilitating sustainable transition (CEDEFOP <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2013</CitationRef>; Vona et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR79">2015</CitationRef>). Previous general finding of the literature is that the diffusion of technologies might have strong skill bias and wage polarisation effects (Chennells and Van Reenen <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2002</CitationRef>; Acemoglu <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2002</CitationRef>; Pianta <CitationRef CitationID="CR64">2005</CitationRef>; Croci Angelini et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2009</CitationRef>). These issues might be of particular relevance for policy design as the speeding up of transition processes may contrast with important social challenges such as reducing inequalities and promoting inclusive growth.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par22">The examples provided so far confirm the idea that interactions and trade-offs between policy instruments play a key role in the effectiveness of the adopted policy mix. These aspects appear to be of particular relevance when policy measures are adopted to foster a radical structural change in economic systems that should conduce to a sustainable transformation contemporaneously promoting economic growth, increasing employment levels and enhancing social cohesion. In this context, the number of policy objectives and instruments increases radically, so that the potential interactions and conflicts between different objectives and instruments may be dramatically high.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par23">While in principle all policy dimensions might be relevant for pushing sustainable transition, scholars have traditionally underscored the important role of environmental and energy policies as well as of innovation and technology policies and the difficulty of addressing co-ordination problems between different instruments belonging to different policy domains. However, the current policy commitment to promote economy recovery and employment growth by sustaining the process of transformation of economic systems into sustainable ones, has put forward the importance of explicitly including in the analysis the labor policy dimension and the relative implications in terms of policy interactions and trade-offs (CEDEFOP <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Para ID="Par25">Even limiting the attention to these three policy pillars the difficulties arising in the design of policy mix, and the importance of achieving some form of coordination between different policies appears to be evident. In particular, a pre-condition for policy coordination is represented by long-term strategic orientation and the adoption of clear strategic policy frameworks in which long-term environmental objectives are nested with social and economic issues such as the support of growth, competitiveness and jobs (European Commission <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">2011a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">b</CitationRef>). A similar long-term perspective has been developed within the systemic approach where the notion of transition policy has emerged as a useful analytical framework that goes beyond the traditional policy approaches in the fields of environment, energy and innovation studies (Kemp <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">1997</CitationRef>; Rotmans et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR70">2001</CitationRef>; van der Berg et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR77">2007</CitationRef>). Transition policy can be defined as the stimulation and management of learning processes, involving different actors and multiple dimensions, preserving the variety of policy and technological options and motivated by a long-term policy objective (Rotmans et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR70">2001</CitationRef>). In this context, policies and governments are expected to influence or even mould transitions in economic systems, since systemic changes in current technological and institutional systems, as well as in environmental, energy and social systems, are required to achieve long-term sustainability goals. Hence, the goal of transition policy must focus on facilitating the design and formation of institutional arrangements that promote and facilitate adaptation mechanisms (Metcalfe <CitationRef CitationID="CR53">2005</CitationRef>; Dopfer and Potts <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2008</CitationRef>). Building on this framework a Green Transition System (GTS) can be defined as a set of institutions and organizations whose collective system of interactions determine the rate and direction of transition processes towards sustainable development. The organization and the structure of the system affect the architecture of knowledge externalities, interactions and transactions between different actors within the system (Antonelli <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2011</CitationRef>). Hence, the governance of Green Transition Systems plays a key role as it shapes the interaction between agents and favors their creative behavior to fuel the sustainable transformation of the economies, which emerges to be not only the result of the intentional action of each individual agent (including policy-makers), but also the endogenous outcome of the dynamics of the system (Arthur et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">1997</CitationRef>; Lane et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2009</CitationRef>; Antonelli and Ferraris <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2011</CitationRef>; Harper and Lewis <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2012</CitationRef>). The individual action and the governance of the system conditions are, consequently, the crucial and complementary elements to explain the emergence of sustainable transition (Lane et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par26">As synthetically described in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>, the (meta) governance of a Green Transition System should aim at aligning and integrating the elements of different policy dimensions entailing sustainable transition. In the exemplified case, the elements of the Innovation System (IS), the Environmental Energy System (EES) and Labor Institutions (LI) that are relevant for the transition process, should be coherently managed within the GTS in order to promote sustainable development.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

              <Para ID="Par27">What is important here to stress, is that green transition is indeed a dynamic process involving the transformation of the overall structure of the economy; hence, not only the quality and types of different policy instruments matter, but also the appropriate dynamic sequence of policy interventions appears to be relevant and to be managed. In order to complete a process of sustainable transition the emergence of a new technological system based on new environmental technologies is necessary and, as previously recalled, this is something requiring a great deal of policy efforts to be achieved, especially in times of crisis (Archibugi et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2013</CitationRef>). For this purpose, policies on the demand side stimulating green innovative investment and the diffusion in the economy of new environmentally friendly technologies should be complemented by effective technology-push instruments (Costantini et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2015</CitationRef>). In this respect, Mazzucato (<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">2013</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR51">2015</CitationRef>) suggests that mission-oriented policies are those having the greatest potential in shaping the emergence of a new (green) technological paradigm.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par28">The rise of this new technological paradigm represents the fuelling mechanism of a process of green transformation of the economy influencing the aggregate dynamics of energy consumption and pollution emissions. Such a dynamics is driven, on the one hand, by the modifications in terms of energy and emission intensities occurred at the sectoral level and associated with the adoption of new environmentally friendly technologies, and, on the other hand, by the changes in the composition of the production structure determined by the structural change. At this stage, the more the public policies are able to stimulate the widespread diffusion of green technologies in all sectors of the economy, the faster the process of transition can be. Moreover, great changes in factor markets are also associated with the process of structural change, which is at the same time shaped by the relative and local abundance of production factors. In this respect, a crucial dimension is represented by labor market policies dealing with the dynamic changes in demand and prices for specific skills (Vona et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR79">2015</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par29">The understanding of the dynamic complexity related to the linkages and interactions among different actors and policy dimensions within the Green Transition System and the subsequent recognition of the problematic outcomes of coordination activities, gives to transition policy the primary role to enhance and possibly guide the adaptive and learning capabilities of agents and institutions involved in the transition in a dynamic perspective (Metcalfe <CitationRef CitationID="CR52">1995</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR53">2005</CitationRef>; Bleda and del Río <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2013</CitationRef>). In this context, the architectural characteristics of the network of interactions that qualify each economic system appear to be also crucial for the valorisation of positive feedbacks that may occur in policy-making processes between perceived policy issues, proposed solutions and policy experiences as well as of cross fertilization mechanisms between academic and policy debates represent a relevant opportunity for the introduction of new instruments and modes of policy action. When such a perspective is adopted, instruments that share some of the features of the European Technology Platforms (ETPs), as a mechanism for bringing together all interested stakeholders to share a long-term vision of sustainable transition, solve particular issues, develop collective learning activities may represent powerful tools for enhancing policy coordination and promoting green growth.</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusions</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par30">The transition towards the green economy is considered as a unique opportunity for jointly contrasting climate change, escaping the carbon lock-in, fostering the generation and diffusion of eco-innovations, re-launching economic growth, improving employment opportunities and social cohesion. The academic and policy debate on this issue is gaining increasing attention, leading to relevant public investments and to the contemporaneous implementation of different policies aimed at fostering sustainable transition. This paper was intended to contribute this debate by focussing on the potential contradictions between different policy objectives linked to green growth. In so doing the analysis emphasized the complexity associated with the design of an appropriate policy mix and the inherent difficulties related to coordination activities aiming at reaching a satisfactory level of policy coherence in a dynamic context. In this respect, the essay offers some examples of potentially contrasting policies in the current policy framework designed to foster the transition towards the green economy.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par31">Such difficulties are shown to clearly emerge in the analysis when a systemic framework is adopted, as it allows us to appreciate how the interactions between agents, institutions and policies shape system performances and how coordination problems arising from these interactive behaviors represent a major issue to be tackled by policy action at each stage of the transition process. When the green transformation of the economy is recognized as the eventual outcome of an emergent system property that takes place if and when there is an appropriate matching between the properties of the system and the characteristics and conducts of individual agents, the role of policy action in shaping the quality of system conditions in which agents operate and interact appears to be crucial.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par32">Building on these considerations the notion of Green Transition System has been put forward, suggesting the importance of the architectural characteristics of the network of interactions and its governance, in order to activating learning and adaptive mechanisms involving private agents, stakeholders, policy-makers and scholars interested and involved in the transition process.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par33">In an influential book on ‘the theory and practice of innovation policy’, Kuhlmann et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR45">2010</CitationRef>) proposed the metaphor of innovation theory and innovation policy as dancing partners, thus emphasizing the process of co-evolution between various actors interested in influencing the rate and direction of technological change. A similar process is needed between actors interested in fostering sustainable transition. However, if environmental, technological and socio-economic goals have to be contemporaneously achieved we would probably have to speak of a (much more complex) ballet in which all actors and scholars involved in different aspects of the transition process co-evolve through mutual learning activities and the development of adaptive capabilities. The complexity of this process is even larger when policies in the same domain are implemented at the same time at different governance levels (supranational, national, regional, etc.). In this context, the performance of the Green Transition System can be enhanced by working on the quality of the networks between agents and on the feedbacks in policy-making processes emerging from different stakeholders and actors involved, as well as on cross fertilization mechanisms between academic and policy debates that may lead to the introduction of new instruments and modes of policy action.</Para>
