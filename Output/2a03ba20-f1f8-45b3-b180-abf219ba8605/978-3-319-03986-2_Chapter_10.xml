          <Para TextBreak="No">The term “medical pluralism” (in this chapter) is used to describe the coexistence in a society of differing medical traditions grounded in different principles or based on different worldviews. In this case, the chapter refers to traditional and modern health care. The chapter starts with the discussion of traditional medicine (TM) in Africa, focusing on its features, categories of practitioners (herbalists, diviners, traditional birth attendants, medicinal ingredient sellers, bonesetters, traditional psychiatrists, traditional surgeon and faith-based healers), determinants of utilisation of traditional medicine, and major criticisms against TM. The discussion of modern medicine revolves around its historical emergence in Africa, the components of modern health care systems, categories of modern health professionals, political organisation of health systems (utilitarian, capitalist, socialised and socialist, and two-tier heath care systems), levels of health care delivery (primary, secondary, and tertiary), and challenges of health care delivery in Africa.</Para>

          <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In all societies, there are alternative or complementary health care systems. However, in modern societies, biomedicine that claims to be evidence-based dominates the health systems. This is why other systems are often referred to as complementary or alternative medicine. The so-called complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> often predates modern medicine; it comprises ways or practices used in medical care before the introduction of modern medicine, but outlives modernisation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Modernisation</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. The term “medical pluralism”<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Medical pluralism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> (in this context) is used to describe the coexistence of biomedicine and alternative medicine. Therefore, medical pluralism (MP) refers to “the coexistence in a society of differing medical traditions, grounded in different principles or based on different world-views” (Gabe et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">2004</CitationRef>, p. 183)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Gabe, J.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. In other words, MP can be defined as the adoption of more than one medical system or the use or integration of both conventional biomedicine and complementary and alternative medicine for health and illness.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Apart from modern medicine that is derived from scientific knowledge, there are other numerous medical traditions which are grouped as alternative and/or complementary medicine. This includes various forms of traditional medicine<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Traditional medicine (TM)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> such as herbal medicine, acupuncture<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Acupuncture</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, chiropractic, and osteopathy. Alternative medicine refers to a medical tradition often devoid of systematic and scientifically verifiable evidence, which people sometimes use in the treatment and prevention of diseases. Alternative medicine is usually derived from historical and cultural traditions. On the other hand, complementary medicine is the phenomenon of the mix of modern and traditional medicines. In this case, traditional medicine is used alongside orthodox medicine. This is why complementary medicine is sometimes referred to as integrative medicine. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM <CitationRef CitationID="CR48">2012</CitationRef>) defines CAM as a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine. Conventional medicine (also herein called modern, western, orthodox, or allopathic medicine) is medicine as practiced by those who are formally trained in biomedical sciences. These people include the physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other allied health professionals, such as physical therapists and psychologists.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Alternative medicine is usually derived from the cultural worldview of the people it serves. This is why there are countless types that are specific to particular ethnic and religious groups (e.g., Chinese, Korean, Yoruba, and Zulu traditional medicines). Cultural variation or multiplicity accounts for the variety of alternative medicines, which are mirrored in the country’s pluralistic medical systems and beliefs surrounding the concepts of illness and health. The conception of health and illness often varies within the systems. Han (<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">2002</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Han, G.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> observed that in pluralistic medical systems, there are divergent sickness labels<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Labels</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> and multiple interpretations of illness conditions. Pluralism also results from heterogeneous cultures with differential traditional care patterns.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Many people identify with alternative medicine because its existence provides options in health care. There is still a preference for alternative medicine among many individuals in both developing and developed countries. In most societies, there is competition between modern and alternative medicine in the care of the patients. Alternative medical practitioners often lay claim of expertise on various illness conditions. In most instances, they are closer to community members than the orthodox medical practitioners. And importantly, modern medicine has not been able to resolve all health problems, and alternative medicine often claims to fill the gap of medical possibilities. This is why they are still relevant.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Like other societies, African societies are not left out. Medical pluralism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Medical pluralism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is a major feature of the health care system. Alternative medicine is osometimes called traditional medicine (TM). Here, some major issues in traditional and modern medicine will be discussed with African examples<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Heading>Traditional Medicine in Africa</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">There are as many traditional medicines (TM) as there are societies in Africa. Every ethno-religious group develops peculiar medical practices and beliefs based on historical and cultural development. TM is a comprehensive term used to refer to systems such as traditional Chinese medicine, Indian ayurveda<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Ayurveda</Primary>

              <Primary>Rosa, I.L.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. The WHO has come to recognise TM as a part of the care system in global health care. One of the first major WHO efforts in this direction was a meeting of African regional experts in Brazzaville in 1976 in which working definitions for TM and African traditional medicine<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm> were adopted. The meeting was followed by another one in Geneva in 1977 which aimed at fashioning strategies to promote traditional medicine. Since then, there have been several WHO reports on traditional medicine. Traditional medicine, also referred to as indigenous or folk medicine<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Folk medicine</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, is defined as “the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness” (WHO <CitationRef CitationID="CR72">2000</CitationRef>, p. 1). Such knowledge and experience are passed from one generation to the next and could be preserved in writing or passed on orally.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Traditional medicine is considered an amalgamation of dynamic medical know-how and ancestral experience. Traditional African medicine is the sum total of all “practices, measures, ingredients and procedures of all kinds, whether material or not, which from time immemorial had enabled the African to guard against disease, to alleviate his [or her] sufferings and cure himself [or herself]” (WHO <CitationRef CitationID="CR68">1976</CitationRef>, p. 3–4). The WHO African regional experts also define a traditional medical practitioner or traditional healer as a person “who is recognised by the community in which he/she lives as competent to provide health care by using vegetable, animal and mineral substances and certain other methods based on the social, cultural and religious backgrounds as well as the prevailing knowledge, attitudes<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Attitudes</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> and beliefs regarding physical, mental and social well-being and the causation of disease and disability in the community.” From the foregoing definitions, some basic features of traditional medicine are evident<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

This is why lay people often refer to traditional medicinal practitioners as “witch doctors” with diabolic and terrestrial powers.

The practitioners are well versed in the names, eulogies, attributions, proscriptions, prescriptions, atonement patterns, and requirements of the ancestors and gods. For instance, in the Yoruba tradition, Esu is one of the gods with unique eulogies, atonement, and ritual requisites, which must be strictly followed to avert his wrath. These eulogies and patterns of atonement are embedded in oral traditions, which are learnt by heart and passed from one generation to the next.</Para>

The poaching of animals for the medicinal trade is common in African countries. Endangered species are hunted because they are often required for medicinal purposes and yield more income for the poachers and medicinal dealers. An herbalist or diviner may require the tusk of an elephant, tongue of a lion, scales of a pangolin, skin/scales or tail of a python, kidney of a hippopotamus, the left eye of a leopard, and, at the extreme, the body parts of human beings for rituals<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            <Para TextBreak="No">In most resource-constrained countries, there is limited access to modern health practitioners. Inadequate accessibility to modern medicines and drugs to treat and manage diseases in middle- and low-income countries, especially in Africa, contributes to the widespread use of TM, especially in poor households (Abdullahi <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Abdullahi, A.A.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Traditional healers usually reside in the community. The ratio of traditional healers to the population is far better than physicians to the population in many African countries (Abudullahi <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2011</CitationRef>). Moreover, traditional medicine is relatively less expensive to utilise. Apart from cultural preference, many poor households seek a more affordable and available health care option, which incidentally is TM. African countries continue to struggle to improve modern health services; unfortunately the high cost of allopathic medical health care and the expensive pharmaceutical products have become unavailable to a majority of people (Kofi-Tsekpo <CitationRef CitationID="CR42">2004</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>, apart from a limited number of health care facilities. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">10.1</InternalRef> shows that access in terms of cost and physical and social distance also affects the utilisation of TM. Traditional healers reside in the community and might be aware of personal and historical antecedents of the community members. This explains (partly) why TM is patronised<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            <Para TextBreak="No">More importantly, the community recognition of traditional healers and social referral also promotes the use of TM. Once an individual is recognised in the community as competent to provide some service, referrals and acceptance are likely to increase. The practice of TM is based on the indigenous knowledge (Weisheit <CitationRef CitationID="CR67">2003</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Weisheit, A.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> and, thus, traditional healers are an integral part of the local culture and are appreciated as key and sustainable sources of care. As such, they will continue to be relevant in health care; this is why the WHO acknowledges traditional medicine as a part of primary health care (PHC)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The 1860s also marked the beginning of colonisation of Nigeria (specifically, Lagos). The missionaries played a central role not only in terms of the provision of health facilities but also manpower development. Missionaries opened teacher training colleges, nursing and midwifery schools, and training schools for other paramedicals, which were most needed for Nigeria’s incipient health care system (Ityavyar <CitationRef CitationID="CR36">1987</CitationRef>, p. 491)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The religious missions were a major supplier of modern health care facilities in Nigeria, as missions accounted for about 40 % of hospital beds after independence from British colonialism in 1960 (Library of Congress <CitationRef CitationID="CR45">1991</CitationRef>). It was further reported that by that time, the number of mission hospitals exceeded government hospitals in number: 118 mission hospitals compared with 101 government hospitals. Later, there was the colonial health development plan that led to the establishment of the University College of Ibadan in 1948 (now the University of Ibadan) with University College Hospital (UCH) in 1952. The objective of UCH was to facilitate manpower development in health care.</Para>

This collaboration among the various categories is absolutely necessary. Due to interdependence, and in some cases intermingling roles, conflict can arise. The patterns of interprofessional cooperation and conflict among health workers have been part of the research focus of medical sociology.

              </ExternalRef>, health politics and policy was briefly discussed as part of the topical description of medical sociology. The organisation of health care in relation to access to care is determined by national objectives that might differ between countries. As a consequence, health care is organised in various ways in different countries of the world. In essence, the political and economic systems provide a basis on which health care is also organised. One of the central political goals is to maintain justice<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Justice</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> (in terms of fairness, equity, desert, and merits) in the allocation of resources including health care resources. As observed by Povar et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR53">2004</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>, there are a number of pressing issues that affect access to health care and thus there is need for political efforts to ensure justice in health care. First, health care resources are finite; their allocation requires hard choices. Second, powerful economic and sociopolitical forces simultaneously shape the rationing of health care. Third, the question of justice, limits, rationing, need, medical necessity, and quality are still unresolved in the distribution of health care resources.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">The utilitarian stance advocates that in case of scarce health resources or an imbalance between demand and medical care, the greatest good for the greatest number must be the principle. Health care must be served in a way that a substantial majority must benefit from health resources. The utilitarian stance focuses on the maximisation of beneficiaries and benefits. Publicly funded health care is directed towards the coverage of common diseases that affect the majority, with the less common ailments being cared for with other available means. Many insurance policies are geared towards the common medical predicaments, so that the majority will benefit with common disease burden alleviated. Certain criteria (e.g., age, medical history, nature of disease) may be set to accommodate the majority of community members in accessing specific care. For instance, “age” may be a criterion in decisions on the limitation of treatment; minors, youth, and adults may be the primary focus of the health care systems where they constitute the majority in the society, while the aged may have limited access to health care. Utilitarianism often presents a technical means of maximising profits because primarily treating the common ailments usually requires less financial burden.</Para>

                </IndexTerm>. The fundamental creeds of free-market health care are efficiency, equity, and freedom of choice. The libertarian health care system is the type that is free of government (imposed) regulations and where services and costs are determined by supply and demand. More importantly, every individual has freedom to choose from numerous available options and payment plans. This type of system is organised and managed by private individuals with the mission to provide appropriate services to their clients. Since most companies are motivated by profit, it is assumed that they would provide the best services to attract patronage in order to maximise profits. In essence, the health sector is deregulated to allow for private players, and offers unlimited services and choices for members of the society (see Herzlinger <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">2004a</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The consumers also reserve the right to switch from one provider to the other and determine the kind of desirable coverage. In practice, the government may provide a limited intervention to support the needy in accessing health care. For instance, in the United States,<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>United States</Primary>

              <Para TextBreak="No">The libertarian system has been heavily criticised. One major feature of a capitalist society is social stratification/inequality. This signifies that there are social differences which translate to differential capacities and capabilities in the society. For instance, there are poor people, people living with disabilities, the unemployed, the aged, youth and children, and undocumented migrants; these groups are vulnerable and may lack adequate capacity to access appropriate health care. In the developing world, where the poor constitute the majority, a free-market system partly accounts for limited access to care. As it is, health is <Emphasis Type="Italic">objectified</Emphasis>,<Emphasis Type="Italic"> commoditised</Emphasis>, and sold to those who can afford it. Health insurance companies may provide selected services and coverage in order to maximise profits.

                </IndexTerm>. Here, egalitarian, socialist, or socialised health care will be used interchangeably. In such systems, there is a collective, social obligation to provide equal access to health care for all. It is also a form of a system that provides universal access to care (universal health care) which is based on humanitarian solidarity<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Solidarity</Primary>
                </IndexTerm>.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Humanitarian solidarity is a form of social relation which implies close links in the society. Humanitarian solidarity also implies a high level of “material” solidarity in terms of the distribution of resources—a situation in which the needs of the less privileged in the society are met. Since there is a polarisation of the society into upper, middle, and lower classes with different capacities, abilities, and vulnerabilities, combining resources will enable the less privileged to be served according to their needs. The government provides an avenue for the collection of taxes and redistribution by providing health care for all. When humanitarian solidarity is related to a health care system, it connotes a situation where everyone contributes according to their ability to the <Emphasis Type="Italic">pool</Emphasis> (of resources) in order to ensure equitable provision and distribution of the health services to all without discrimination on the basis of any social factors<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

It has been argued that health care services should only reflect differences in health care needs and not individual or group differences (see Daniels <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2001</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Daniels, N.</Primary>
                </IndexTerm>. In other words, there should be equal benefits to all. Once health care reflects group difference, this implies discrimination which is not ethical.

              <Para TextBreak="No">In a socialised health care system, <Emphasis Type="Italic">fair burden</Emphasis> is a fundamental principle. Individuals should not bear undue brunt; therefore, the costs and burden of meeting health care needs is spread across individuals in the society by a progressive tax system.

Another issue that is related to universal access is <Emphasis Type="Italic">comprehensive benefits</Emphasis>, a situation in which a health care system is strengthened to cover almost all services that might be required by the citizens. A health system may be regarded as just when health services cover the full range of health care needs.

Socialised health care may fail because it limits freedom of choice. There is often strict legislation which outlaws private players. The unidirectional method of seeking care puts more pressure on the health system. Many patients end up on a waiting list to access medical care. There are often limited choices or sometimes no choices at all. Socialised medicine often promotes inefficiency. There is often bureaucracy<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Bureaucracy</Primary>
                </IndexTerm> since everybody has to turn to a government-run system. In a system where there is no (healthy) competition, innovation in care is deterred. One major setback is the close link of care with government expenditure. The link implies that a cut in public spending means a drastic overall fall in the quality of care. In the era of economic recession which necessitates reduction in government spending, there is a common fate of reduced quantity and quality in government-administered social amenities including health care. In socialised medicine, fair burden does not mean or translate to fair treatment.

Second, there is a blurring of the boundaries between what is public and what is private and a multiplicity of actors and institutions, formal and informal, involved in health care production. A public practitioner can at the same time provide private services. In the public health sector, care seekers may still have to pay for some services. More so, a pluralistic system as practiced in Africa creates room for the influx of unregulated practitioners. Despite this combination of (political) principles in health care, access to health care in Africa is still a major challenge.

Cases that require further care may be referred to the secondary health facilities where specialised care is offered. The last level of referral is the tertiary level in which more advanced care is available. While the sequential flow is an ideal situation, studies have indicated that many patients frequently bypass primary health care facilities in favour of higher-level hospitals to get better care despite spending a substantial amount of additional time and money (Audo et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2005</CitationRef>; Kruk et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">2009</CitationRef>; Kahabuka et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

It is responsible for a high prevalence of disease because it accounts for poor nutrition, social maginalisation, poor living conditions, and (more importantly) low access to health care. Poverty limits the financial capability of individuals to access appropriate health care. It also stymies the effectiveness of basic health care (especially preventive services). The malnourished or those who lack basic hygiene or who reside in unhygienic environments are constantly exposed to health hazards.

UNDP (<CitationRef CitationID="CR64">2011</CitationRef>, p. 6) corroborated that common corrupt practices in the health sector include absenteeism, theft of medical supplies, informal payments, fraud, weak regulatory procedures, improperly designed procurement procedures, diversion of supplies in the distribution system for private gains, and embezzlement of health care funds. The general poor political governance also reflects in weak governance of health development across Africa (see Kirigia and Kirigia <CitationRef CitationID="CR41">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
