                <Para ID="Par4">If not treated appropriately, deep-seated MRSA-associated infections present with higher amputation rates than deep-seated MSSA-associated infections. PVL-positive MRSA strains caused more frequently pus-forming lesions and less bacteremia and invasive diseases. Methods for discriminating CA-MRSA from HA-MRSA strains are now unreliable due to circulation of both ST 239 and ST 59 strains in the community and nosocomial settings. Initial antibiotic treatments should consider MRSA for patients with SSTIs in areas where MRSA is prevalent.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par5">
                        <Emphasis Type="Italic">Staphylococcus aureus</Emphasis> is a major pathogen responsible for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in humans. The number of SSTI episodes with a culture-confirmed pathogen increased from 11 % to 24 % between 1998 and 2009, while the incidence of methicillin-resistant <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis> (MRSA) increased from 5 % in 1998 to 42 % in 2005 before decreasing to 37 % in 2009 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. In the USA, colonization by <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis> is high among SSTI patients, particularly that of USA300 MRSA [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. In Taiwan, the prevalence of MRSA in most of the major hospitals ranged from 53 % to 83 % [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]; MRSA is a major pathogen related to SSTIs [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par6">It is considered that community-acquired (CA)-MRSA strains are more virulent than hospital-acquired (HA)-MRSA because they possess specific virulence factors and they spread more readily than CA-methicillin-sensitive <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis> (CA-MSSA) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. Various extracellular proteins produced by <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis> have been reported to mediate diseases with distinct cutaneous and systemic features. For example, superantigen exotoxin (TSST-1) is associated with staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome, exhibiting desquamative skin rash and multiple organ failure [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. Exfoliatin A (ETA) and exfoliatin B (ETB) are associated with staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome with localized and generalized blister formation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and γ-hemolysin (Hlg) target immune cells, such as polymorphonuclear cells and macrophages, to cause pus-forming SSTIs [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. However, the actual correlations between <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis> virulence factors and the pathogenesis of different SSTI clinical presentations are unclear.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par7">The surgical timing and the choice of empiric antimicrobials when treating <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis>-associated SSTI are still controversial because of different clinical presentations and regional variations in their prevalence [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. In this preliminary study, the clinical characteristics of SSTIs, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and the virulence factors of <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis> strains with specific genetic backgrounds were investigated.</Para>

                <Para ID="Par8">This study was performed at the Chiayi Christian Hospital, a 1000-bed teaching hospital in southern Taiwan, between January 2008 and November 2008 and was approved by the research ethics committee of the Chiayi Christian Hospital (097032 and 101051). The medical records of patients diagnosed with SSTI were reviewed, including demographic data, the type of infection, and underlying chronic illnesses (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic liver disease, coronary artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or malignancy). We categorized 307 cases of <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis> SSTIs on the basis of peculiarity and severity of their clinical presentations into six distinct groups as follows: deep-seated infection (necrotizing fasciitis, osteomyelitis, pyomyositis, and septic arthritis), cutaneous infection (cellulitis, bullous impetigo, furuncle, carbuncle, and staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome), abscess requiring surgical intervention, postpartum mastitis, catheter-related (peritoneal catheter or intravascular catheter) exit-site infection, or SSTI-related bacteremia. We also documented the microbiological data, appropriateness of empiric antibiotics, number of surgical interventions and reconstructions, need for amputation, length of hospital stay, and the in-hospital mortality rate.</Para>

Blood cultures were processed using a VITEK 2 GP system (BioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, MO, USA) in the hospital laboratory. <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis> was further confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the <Emphasis Type="Italic">clfA</Emphasis>, 16S rRNA, and <Emphasis Type="Italic">nuc</Emphasis> genes, as described previously [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. BCRC 10781 and BCRC 15211 were used as the methicillin-susceptible and -resistant reference strains, respectively.

                <Para ID="Par14">Clinical <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis> isolates were collected from 307 SSTI patients, among whom 130 (42.3 %) patients were infected by MSSA and 177 (57.7 %) by MRSA. CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA infections accounted for 68 (38.4 %) and 109 (61.6 %) respectively. Abscess requiring surgical intervention (36.2 %) and cutaneous infection (34.2 %) were the most common clinical features of <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis>-associated SSTI, followed by deep-seated infection (16.9 %), SSTI-related bacteremia (11.4 %), catheter-related exit-site infection (8.1 %), and mastitis (5.2 %). MRSA was more prevalent in all disease groups than MSSA. The most significant predisposing factor was diabetes mellitus (33.6 %), followed by chronic renal diseases (23.5 %) and chronic liver diseases (9.7 %).</Para>
                <Para ID="Par15">Univariate analyses of selected clinical characteristics of SSTI showed significant differences in the clinical presentations of various disease types, excluding the mortality rate. For example, the deep-seated infection group had higher comorbidity and amputation rates than did the abscess group, and the SSTI-related bacteremia group had the highest mean age and duration of hospitalization (Tables <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">2</InternalRef>). However, most of the clinical characteristics of MRSA-associated SSTI were similar to those of MSSA-associated SSTIs for each infection type (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab3">3</InternalRef>), except MRSA-associated deep-seated infections presented with a higher amputation rate than did MSSA-associated ones (20.6 % <Emphasis Type="Italic">vs.</Emphasis> 0, <Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis> &lt; 0.05).<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab1">

Irrespective of the methicillin-resistance phenotype, PVL genes were detected most frequently in abscesses, i.e., 66.7 % (74/111), followed by mastitis, cutaneous infections, deep-seated infections, bacteremia, and catheter-related infections. Among all of the SSTI cases, only one ETB gene was identified from a patient with staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome. Compared with other MSSA disease groups, ETA genes were more common in catheter-related exit-site MSSA infections (37.5 %) (<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis> &lt; 0.05). All the MRSA isolates possessed Hlg genes, which were otherwise only present in 92.3 % of the MSSA isolates (<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis> &lt; 0.01).

                        <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis>-associated SSTIs exhibit diverse clinical presentations, mediated by various bacterial toxins and host susceptibility to some extent. Localized cutaneous infections in healthy individuals may resolve spontaneously using topical antimicrobials. However, the majority of abscess-forming lesions usually require surgical intervention. Aggressive antimicrobial treatment of deep-seated infections and SSTI-related bacteremia is crucial for survival. Compared with MSSA infections, MRSA infections may present with different clinical characteristics and outcomes for deep-seated infections, bacteremia, catheter-related infections, and mastitis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>]. It has been reported that patients with MRSA bacteremia have a significantly higher mortality rate (15–60 %) and longer hospitalization duration compared with those with MSSA bacteremia [<CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>]. By contrast, Miller <Emphasis Type="Italic">et al</Emphasis>. reported that most clinical characteristics of MRSA-associated SSTI could not be used as markers to distinguish MSSA-infected patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>]. Our results indicate that deep-seated MRSA infections presented with a higher amputation rate than MSSA infections (20.6 % <Emphasis Type="Italic">vs.</Emphasis> 0 %) (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab3">3</InternalRef>). It should be noted that most patients (78.1 %) with MRSA infections received ineffective empiric antimicrobial therapy. Thus, the correlation between diverse clinical outcomes and inappropriate empiric therapy for severe infections requires further study.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par23">Catheter-related exit-site infection is a peculiar nosocomial infection, which is usually associated with bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in SSTIs, and has been reported as the most common source of <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis> bacteremia, with equal proportions of MSSA and MRSA infection [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>]. Here, patients with catheter-related exit-site MRSA infections were more prevalent and had more concurrent bacteremia (64.7 % <Emphasis Type="Italic">vs.</Emphasis> 0) compared with MSSA infections, suggesting a greater prevalence of MRSA in our hospital.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par24">In general, <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis>, β-hemolytic <Emphasis Type="Italic">streptococcus</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Escherichia coli</Emphasis>, and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Bacteroides spp.</Emphasis> have been isolated from patients with postpartum mastitis. Among the mastitis-associated MRSA isolates obtained in this investigation, 10/11 (90.9 %) were classified as HA-MRSA strains, but their antimicrobial resistance patterns and PCR results indicated that most isolates possessed the characteristics of CA-MRSA strains.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par25">According to the isolates analyzed by PFGE, the predominant MRSA genotypes were pulsotypes A, C, and D. Pulsotype A isolates related to ST 239 are the major HA-MRSA clones in Taiwan [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>], whereas pulsotype C and D isolates related to ST 59 are the prevalent clones of CA-MRSA in Taiwan [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>]. However, we identified both ST 239 and ST 59 strains from CA and HA-SSTI patients, thereby implying that both strains are circulating concomitantly in community and nosocomial settings.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par26">It was notable that there was a significant association between PVL and MRSA, particularly in cutaneous abscess compared with bacteremia and invasive illnesses. These findings suggest that PVL-positive strains have a higher tendency to develop pus-forming lesions that often require surgical drainages. PVL-positive isolates were significantly more prevalent among the CA-MRSA strains compared with MSSA strains, as described previously [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>], thereby reflecting the consequences of the widespread use of β-lactam antibiotics, leading to the selection of a few restricted PVL-positive MRSA strains. Furthermore, PVL genes were identified in both CA- and HA-MRSA strains that possessed SCC<Emphasis Type="Italic">mec</Emphasis> type III, although SCC<Emphasis Type="Italic">mec</Emphasis> type IV isolates were dominant in both the CA- and HA-MRSA groups (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab4">4</InternalRef>). Our results suggest that the SCC<Emphasis Type="Italic">mec</Emphasis> types and the presence of PVL genes are not useful molecular markers for distinguishing between CA- and HA-MRSA strains.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par27">TSST-1, ETA, and ETB are reportedly the major virulence factors associated with some peculiar skin and systemic syndromes in clinical settings. The low carriage rate of these genes in <Emphasis Type="Italic">S. aureus</Emphasis> isolates from SSTI patients could explain the low incidence of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome in the present study. Diverse skin and systemic presentations of various disease types of SSTI may be correlated with other exotoxin genes or combinations of virulence factors. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">mecA</Emphasis> gene was not found in an MRSA isolate in this study, which could be related to diverse resistance mechanisms, e.g., the production of β-lactamase or other unidentified factors that may contribute to resistance in MRSA [<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>]. Furthermore, three MSSA isolates that possessed the <Emphasis Type="Italic">mecA</Emphasis> gene may have been derived from a <Emphasis Type="Italic">mecA</Emphasis>-positive MRSA strain subpopulation with a heterogeneous resistance phenotype that cannot be detected by traditional susceptibility testing [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par28">The treatment of SSTIs involves topical agents, surgical intervention, or oral or parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Recent reports and the present study demonstrate the high impact of MRSA in SSTIs [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>]. Uncomplicated skin abscesses are curable by surgical drainage alone; antimicrobials are not necessary according to the current guidelines. In areas with a high prevalence of MRSA infections, empiric antimicrobial treatment should consider the possibility of MRSA infection in complicated SSTIs and immunocompromised individuals. CA-MRSA strains with type IV SCC<Emphasis Type="Italic">mec</Emphasis> elements are more susceptible to a variety of non-β-lactam antimicrobials than are HA-MRSA strains [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>]; antimicrobial susceptibility patterns have been used to discriminate CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA strains. However, this approach is now unreliable because CA-MRSA may also acquire resistance to non-β-lactam antibiotics [<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>]. Clindamycin has been used as an option for staphylococcal SSTIs due to its good distribution in skin and wound exudates [<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef>]. However, we found that erythromycin and clindamycin resistance were much more frequent (over 94 %) in both CA- and HA-MRSA isolates than those reported recently from different countries [<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">39</CitationRef>]. The treatment guidelines for MRSA infections should be adjusted according to the currently defined efficacy of non-β-lactam antimicrobials. For complicated SSTIs, the treatment of patients with appropriate initial antimicrobials is associated with a statistically significant impact on the cure rate [<CitationRef CitationID="CR40">40</CitationRef>]. According to the susceptibility tests in the present study, SXT appears to be an appropriate empiric oral antimicrobial for treating CA-MRSA infections, whereas fusidic acid is more suitable for treating both CA- and HA-MRSA infections (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>). Vancomycin is warranted only for empiric use when treating deep-seated, life-threatening MRSA infections.</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusions</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par29">MRSA is an important emerging pathogen in SSTIs. Most of the clinical characteristics of MRSA-associated SSTIs are similar to those of MSSA-associated SSTIs, except for the higher amputation rate in deep-seated MRSA infections. We found that PVL-positive strains had a higher tendency to cause pus-forming lesions, whereas they were rarely associated with bacteremia and invasive diseases. ETB and TSST-1 genes were identified only rarely in various SSTI disease types. The previously employed criteria and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for discriminating CA- and HA-MRSA strains are now unreliable because both ST 239 (major clone of HA-MRSA) and ST 59 (major clone of CA-MRSA) strains are circulating concomitantly in community and nosocomial settings in Taiwan. Early surgical drainage of pus-forming lesions and appropriate antimicrobials for invasive infections are mandatory for SSTI treatment. If indicated, the initial empiric antimicrobial treatment should consider MRSA for patients with SSTIs in areas where MRSA is prevalent.</Para>
