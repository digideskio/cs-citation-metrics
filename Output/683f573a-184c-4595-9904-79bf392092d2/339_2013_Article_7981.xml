              <Para>Polycrystalline BaMnO<Subscript>3</Subscript> ceramic powders were prepared using the conventional mixed oxide route accompanied with several milling processes. Single phase formation was verified by recording the X-ray diffraction pattern of the powder as well as sintered pellet at room temperature. Scanning electron micrograph and energy dispersive X-ray spectrum of cross-sectional view have shown that sintered pellet is highly porous and contains only Ba, Mn and O elements, respectively. Analysis of impedance spectroscopy was carried out via the complex impedance and complex modulus formalisms. These results have shown that BaMnO<Subscript>3</Subscript> behave as semiconducting material. Furthermore, as a consequence of electrically inhomogeneous nature of the sample, it was observed that the electroactive regions (such as grain, grain boundary and sample-electrode interface) are overlapped in the applied frequency domain with dominant grain boundary effect.

              <Para>For technologically potential applications, it is important to improve efficiency of existing materials or synthesize new materials by focusing on new routes of synthesis and their processing conditions followed by careful investigation of structural, morphological, magnetic and electrical properties through sophisticated techniques. Materials of perovskite-related structure such as manganites, with formula AMnO<Subscript>3</Subscript> is an important family of ceramics that have versatile structural and promising electrical and magnetic properties [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. Here “A” and “Mn” represent the corner and body centered cations, respectively, while “O” represents anion occupied at the face centered position of the unit cell. These manganites are chemically and thermally stable at high temperatures and have found some suitable industrial applications. Barium manganate (BaMnO<Subscript>3</Subscript>) is one of the members of manganites sub-family. It possesses different hexagonal (H) and rhombohedral (R) structures such as 2H, 4H, 6H, …, 15R, 21R, etc., which are stable at different sintering temperatures investigated by Negas, T. and Roth, R.S. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Parras, M. et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>] and Gonzalez-Calbet, J.M. et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>] have studied the microstructure of different phases of this material. Recently, this material has been studied as an efficient candidate of NO direct decomposition into nitrogen (N<Subscript>2</Subscript>) and oxygen (O<Subscript>2</Subscript>) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>], hydrogen storage material as a result of hydrogen uptake at atmospheric pressure [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>] and gas sensor at different temperatures under various concentrations of O<Subscript>2</Subscript> [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>However, to find some practical applications of this material it is necessary to explore its properties (such as electrical or magnetic properties, etc.). In case of electrical characterizations an impedance spectroscopy (IS) was employed to explore the effect of different electro-active regions. Impedance spectroscopy is a powerful technique used to investigate the electrical microstructures of materials both qualitatively and quantitatively [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. In this technique, a suitable range of frequency of a small AC signal is applied to the materials and impedance spectra are measured at various low and/or high temperatures. The analysis of such impedance spectra is then used to explore the properties of materials.</Para>
              <Para>In this report the electrical properties of barium manganate ceramic are investigated through complex impedance (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Z</Emphasis>
                <Superscript>∗</Superscript>) and modulus (<Emphasis Type="Italic">M</Emphasis>
                <Superscript>∗</Superscript>) formalisms to identify the different electro-active regions in ceramics (i.e., grain, grain boundary and electrode effects). This study also includes the analysis of ac conductivity as a function of frequency (20 Hz–2 MHz) and temperature (300–370 K) to investigate the possible operating conduction mechanism in this material. Four different types of formalisms that uses for data analysis in complex spectroscopy (CS) are: complex impedance <Emphasis Type="Italic">Z</Emphasis>
                <Superscript>∗</Superscript>, complex admittance <Emphasis Type="Italic">Y</Emphasis>
                <Superscript>∗</Superscript>, complex permittivity <Emphasis Type="Italic">ε</Emphasis>
                <Superscript>∗</Superscript> and complex modulus <Emphasis Type="Italic">M</Emphasis>
                <Superscript>∗</Superscript>. In this spectroscopy one or more <Emphasis Type="Italic">RC</Emphasis> circuits (with <Emphasis Type="Italic">R</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">C</Emphasis> in parallel combinations) in series combinations are employed to explore the realistic view of the impedance of the electrode-sample-electrode system whose results are most probably unambiguous [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Para>BaCO<Subscript>3</Subscript> (Sigma-Aldrich, purity≥99 %) and MnO<Subscript>2</Subscript> (Sigma-Aldrich, purity≥99 %) were used as starting materials for the synthesis of BaMnO<Subscript>3</Subscript> by conventional mixed oxide route. Prior to mixing the raw materials in stoichiometric amount (with molar ratio 1:1), BaCO<Subscript>3</Subscript> and MnO<Subscript>2</Subscript> were dried at 180 °C and 500 °C overnight, respectively, in oven/furnace to eliminate water contents. The weighed raw materials (BaCO<Subscript>3</Subscript> and MnO<Subscript>2</Subscript>) were mixed with distilled water in a polyethylene bottle (jar) of 250 ml, containing cylindrical shaped magnesia-doped zirconia media. This mixture was then milled for 24 hours to get homogenous mixture of almost same diameter particles of different precursors. After wet sieving, the milled slurry was dried in oven at 80 °C for 30 hours, followed by grinding and then sieved by a 250 μm stainless steel (SS) sieve to get fine powder. The acquired fine powder was pre-heated at 1000 °C for 5 hours at ramp rates of 5 °C/min. After taking X-ray diffraction pattern, the reacted powders were re-milled, wet sieved, dried and finally dry sieved for good sinterability.</Para>

                <Para>The fine powders were then pressed in cylindrical green pellets of ∼2 mm thickness using a SS die of 10 mm diameter by applying a uniaxial load of 0.4 tons for 2 min. Cracks were observed in pellets fired at high temperatures. To avoid these cracks, prior to sintering, green pellets were more compacted by applying a 240 MPa isostatic pressure for 1–2 min using cold isostatic press (CIP). After CIP, these compacted green pellets were sintered in tube furnace at 1300 °C for a dwell time of 5 h with heating ramp rate of 2 °C per minute and temperature cooling rate of 1 °C per minute.</Para>

Morphology and composition analysis of un-etched and thermally etched pellets were taken using scanning electron microscope (SEM), LEO-4401, and electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA) attached with SEM, respectively. Prior to low temperature impedance data measurement, both surfaces of pellet were polished using SiC paper, followed by painting with gold paste. After painting, pellets were dried at 200 °C and then fired at 800 °C for 2 h to burn off the organics contained in the Au paste. Both the heating and cooling ramp rates of furnace were kept as 10 °C/min. Impedance data was recorded at an applied AC voltage of 100 mV using impedance analyzer (Agilent E4980A, Agilent, USA). Frequency was varied from 20 Hz to 2 MHz while temperature was changed from 300–370 K with a step of 10 K.</Para>

To authenticate our results Archimedes principle was employed to measure the sintered pellet density (in water medium) and results were compared with reported theoretical density of investigating material. It was found that the experimental density (5.89 g/cm<Superscript>3</Superscript>) was 97.42 % of the theoretical density (6.044 g/cm<Superscript>3</Superscript>). This indicates that the high degree of porosity as observed in the pellet is the inherent property of this material.</Para>

                <Para>Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef> illustrates the Nyquist plots for BaMnO<Subscript>3</Subscript> sample at various temperatures ranges from 300 to 370 K. In these plots frequency is directed from high <Emphasis Type="Italic">Z</Emphasis>′-intercept towards low <Emphasis Type="Italic">Z</Emphasis>′-intercept point (i.e., at the origin). At low frequency the intersection of Nyquist plots with <Emphasis Type="Italic">Z</Emphasis>′-axis provides the total resistance of the sample. At each temperature the Nyquist plot shows overlapped and depressed semicircular arcs with center lying below the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Z</Emphasis>′-axis. This specify two distinct features of the sample: (i) the overlapped nature of the semicircular arcs demonstrate that at each temperature more than one relaxation phenomena (associated with different electroactive regions) exist in our material. The associated difference in the relaxation times, <Emphasis Type="Italic">τ</Emphasis>=<Emphasis Type="Italic">RC</Emphasis> (where <Emphasis Type="Italic">R</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">C</Emphasis> are the resistor and capacitor, respectively) is very small. (ii) The depressed nature of the arcs indicates the non-ideal Debye type behavior of the sample. This non-ideal behavior may be due to several factors including oxygen vacancies as a result of non-stoichiometric distribution of oxygen, dangling bonds at grain boundaries, grains orientation, stress-strain phenomena in the lattice etc. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. This non-ideal behavior of the sample will be explored later on from the fitting results of impedance data using ZView software. Furthermore, as temperature increases the radius of each semicircular arc was found to decrease accordingly. This illustrates that resistivity of the sample decreases by increasing the temperature of BaMnO<Subscript>3</Subscript> sample which is the characteristic of semiconducting materials. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig2">

Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>(a) shows that for all temperatures <Emphasis Type="Italic">Z</Emphasis>′ decreases with increasing frequency. The dispersion in <Emphasis Type="Italic">Z</Emphasis>′ is fast at lower frequencies as a result of significant effect of polarization (such as interfacial polarization and Debye type orientational polarization of dipoles) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>] of the material. While, due to rotational displacements of the dipoles, dispersion in <Emphasis Type="Italic">Z</Emphasis>′ becomes almost independent at higher frequencies. Also, at lower frequencies, the magnitude of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Z</Emphasis>′ decreases with increasing temperature. This indicates that the AC conductivity of the sample has been increased as a result of decrease in the resistance of different electro-active regions (such as grains, grain boundaries, surface layers, sample-electrode effects, etc.) in the sample [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>].

(iii) The shift and broadening of the peak can be explained in term of grain boundaries.

(iv) Increase in the peak’s broadening with raising temperature is an indication of inhomogenity of the sample. Also, the asymmetrical nature of the peaks suggests the non-Debye type behavior of our sample. From the above discussion it is noteworthy that to model the IS data for such materials, in the studied temperature regime, more than one <Emphasis Type="Italic">RC</Emphasis> circuits will be used in the equivalent circuit.</Para>
                <Para>Recently, Satapathy et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>] studied the ferroelectric behavior of 2H–BaMnO<Subscript>3</Subscript>. In their work, they have investigated the presence of some Mn<Superscript>+3</Superscript> cations along with Mn<Superscript>+4</Superscript> cations which produce disorder in the crystal lattice of this material. In view of these results, we can understand the trend of our impedance results with temperature that Mn<Superscript>4+</Superscript> will reduce and form Mn<Superscript>3+</Superscript> which results in the creation of oxygen vacancies. The existence of Mn<Superscript>4+</Superscript> and Mn<Superscript>3+</Superscript> will facilitate the hopping of carriers in the investigating material [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>In Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>(b), at each temperature, low resistive phenomena exist at lower frequencies which are suppressed by the high resistive region in the material. To clarify this effect, we have re-plotted the data at 310 K on log–log scale, as shown in the inset in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>(b). It is clear from the figure shown in the inset that a peak exists at low frequency which corresponds to some relaxation phenomena in the material and we will discuss it later.

                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">R</Emphasis>). Using these expression, the associated <Emphasis Type="Italic">R</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">C</Emphasis> with peak 1 and 2, at 310 K, have values <Emphasis Type="Italic">R</Emphasis>

                  <Subscript>0</Subscript>) spectroscopic plots as a function of frequency at two different temperatures, i.e., at 300 K and 370 K. The main advantage of using modulus spectroscopy is that, in this formalism the information about the electrode effect is suppressed and one can easily study the intrinsic effect of the sample that can originate from electro-active region (i.e., grain) in the sample. This formalism is also helpful to study the conductivity relaxation time. Sinclair et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>] proposed that a combine plot of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Z</Emphasis>″ vs. log(<Emphasis Type="Italic">f</Emphasis>) and <Emphasis Type="Italic">M</Emphasis>″/<Emphasis Type="Italic">ε</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>0</Subscript> vs. log(<Emphasis Type="Italic">f</Emphasis>) is used to notice the effect of the largest resistor and the smallest capacitor. According to them, for a particular <Emphasis Type="Italic">RC</Emphasis> circuit element, −<Emphasis Type="Italic">Z</Emphasis>″ and <Emphasis Type="Italic">M</Emphasis>″/<Emphasis Type="Italic">ε</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>0</Subscript> peaks on the frequency scale should be coincident. In Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">6</InternalRef>(a), at 300 K, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Z</Emphasis>″ vs. log(<Emphasis Type="Italic">f</Emphasis>) plot shows a single peak which shifts towards high frequency with increase of temperature as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">6</InternalRef>(b). In <Emphasis Type="Italic">M</Emphasis>″/<Emphasis Type="Italic">ε</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>0</Subscript> vs. log(<Emphasis Type="Italic">f</Emphasis>) spectrum an onset of peak can be seen at 300 K which is not fully formed/or visible. With increasing temperature onset of <Emphasis Type="Italic">M</Emphasis>″/<Emphasis Type="Italic">ε</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>0</Subscript> peak shifts towards high frequency as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">6</InternalRef>(b). This is due to the limitation of available experimental frequency range i.e., 20 Hz–2 MHz and we are not getting the bulk information with increasing temperature. This issue can be solved by increasing the frequency range which is system limitation. As in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">6</InternalRef> both peaks are located at different frequencies and their peak maxima are separated by more than one order of magnitude. It means that these Debye peaks represent two different electro-active regions in the material. At 300 K, the capacitance values were found to have values in nano-Farad (nF) and pico-Farad (pF) as calculated from the peaks in −<Emphasis Type="Italic">Z</Emphasis>″ vs. log(<Emphasis Type="Italic">f</Emphasis>) and <Emphasis Type="Italic">M</Emphasis>″/<Emphasis Type="Italic">ε</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>0</Subscript> vs. log(<Emphasis Type="Italic">f</Emphasis>) plots, respectively. On the basis of capacitance values these two electro-active regions were assign names as grain boundary and grain as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">6</InternalRef>. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig6">

                <Para>In materials (especially electrically inhomogeneous), when the impedance response of one electro-active region overlaps with the response of other electro-active region in the applied frequency domain, a composite response is generated in the impedance spectrum. Equivalent circuit analysis is then an important alternative source employed to isolate the response of different electro-active regions and characterize them separately. From Nyquist plot, in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>, and loss spectrum, in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>, it is difficult to distinguish the bulk effect (at high frequency) and electrode effect (at low frequency) from dominant grain boundary effect (at intermediate frequency).

In these ECMs, one circuit was used for grain boundary while second circuit represents the electrode effect. Fitting analysis of these ECMs has shown disagreement with experimental results most probably at the high frequency region. This indicates that the high frequency region is the outcome of complex response of more than one electro-active region in the sample. Therefore, we added a third <Emphasis Type="Italic">RC</Emphasis> circuit to the ECM to fit the impedance data at different temperatures.

                  <Subscript>ac</Subscript>) vs. log(<Emphasis Type="Italic">f</Emphasis>) show two different features, (i) a frequency independent region at lower frequencies (i.e., up to 10 kHz at 300 K) and (ii) a dispersion region at higher frequencies. The frequency independent plateau/or region corresponding to the DC conductivity which originate as a result of random diffusion of charge carriers through hopping phenomena between neighbor sites [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. The value of DC conductivity (<Emphasis Type="Italic">σ</Emphasis>

                <Para>Activation energy of 0.317 eV±0.058 was calculated from the slope <Emphasis Type="Italic">m</Emphasis> of linear fit of the data in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig12">12</InternalRef>. This value is in good agreement as compared to the activation energy value calculated from relaxation time vs. 1000/<Emphasis Type="Italic">T</Emphasis> plot as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig5">5</InternalRef>. In Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig11">11</InternalRef>, the plateau at lower frequencies is followed by a frequency dispersion point known as the hopping frequency. The hopping frequency depends upon temperature which shifts towards higher frequency side as temperature of the sample increases. In the second dispersion region at high frequency the conductivity of the material increases rapidly with frequency as well as temperature. This indicates that some hopping type conduction of charge carriers exist in the material and the resultant conductivity follows the universal Jonscher’s power law: <Equation ID="Equ3">

                <Para>Variation of exponent “<Emphasis Type="Italic">s</Emphasis>” with temperature (<Emphasis Type="Italic">T</Emphasis>) is used as a signature of possible electrical conduction mechanism in materials. It is noteworthy from Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig13">13</InternalRef> that exponent “<Emphasis Type="Italic">s</Emphasis>” decreases as temperature increase, suggesting that correlated barrier hopping (CBH) is the possible conduction mechanism in BaMnO<Subscript>3</Subscript> sample [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>]. In this model conduction in materials takes place through the hopping of carriers over a potential barrier. Such potential barrier exists as a result of two different valance states.</Para>

                  <Subscript>ac</Subscript>) increases linearly with increasing temperature due to upsurge in thermally activated phenomena of charge carriers. ln(<Emphasis Type="Italic">σ</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>ac</Subscript>) also follows Arrhenius equation as given in Eq. (<InternalRef RefID="Equ2">2</InternalRef>) for DC conductivity.

                <Para>Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">2</InternalRef> shows that activation energy decreases as frequency of the applied voltage is increased. This indicates that by increasing temperature the charge carries, most probably accumulated at the grain boundaries, acquire sufficient energy to hop to the neighbor site over the barrier which results in the rise in conductivity of our material and is in accordance with our expectations.</Para>

              <Para>High temperature conventional mixed oxides route was used to synthesize single phase barium manganate powder. XRD, SEM, and EDX results have verified that the reacted powder is of single phase poly-crystalline material with sintered pellet of highly porous morphology that contains only barium (Ba), manganese (Mn), and oxygen (O) elements, respectively. IS analysis was carried out via complex impedance and complex modulus formalisms and results show that BaMnO<Subscript>3</Subscript> behave as semiconducting material with NTCR. Grain, grain boundary, and sample-electrode regions in Nyquist and Bode plots were observed to overlap, in the applied frequency domain, suggesting that our material is electrically inhomogeneous in nature.

Grain and grain boundary conductivity plots show that grains are more conductive than grain boundaries. The activation energy for conduction at grains and grain boundaries is 0.278 eV and 0.292 eV, respectively. Analysis of ac conductivity as a function of frequency and temperature indicates that correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model is the possible operating conduction mechanism in BaMnO<Subscript>3</Subscript> sample.</Para>
