            <Para ID="Par4" TextBreak="No">The notion of the “born leader” has been deeply rooted in popular imagination since ancient times, whether reflected in historical political structures that bestowed power to monarchs by virtue of their bloodline, or in cultural legends that attribute the triumphs of heroes to circumstances of birth and their innate superior skills. From antiquity, it has been assumed that leaders displayed certain personal characteristics that distinguish them from their followers. Plato believed that leaders possessed superior reasoning capacity and wisdom, whereas Machiavelli emphasized the inherent ability of the successful leader to understand and to manipulate social situations [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. Thomas Jefferson believed there was a natural aristocracy among men, reflected in the elements of genius and virtue [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par5" TextBreak="No">Behavioral scientists still debate whether leaders are born or made. Indeed, in scholarly circles, the pendulum of opinion has swung from nature to nurture and back again over the past century. From everyday experience, it seems intuitively obvious that leaders are different than followers, that leaders possess something that, for lack of a better term, might be called “the right stuff” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. To some, leadership is almost entirely an acquired skill, and they see only a very limited role for genetics or inherited traits. Others contend that potential leaders are endowed with certain fundamental talents not possessed by those who follow.</Para>

            <Heading>Great Man Theories</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par6" TextBreak="No">In the nineteenth century, “great man” theories asserted that the personal qualities that define leadership were inherited and that these attributes were mostly associated with an upper class lineage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Galton [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>] is often credited as the first to methodically investigate the inherited basis of leadership. In his 1869 treatise <Emphasis Type="Italic">Hereditary Genius: an inquiry into its laws and consequences</Emphasis>, he introduced concepts that later generations of scholars would come to find highly controversial and even racially charged. Galton studied generations of leaders and believed that superior intelligence was the key, and that this attribute was inherited, not acquired [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. His work formed an intellectual rationalization for eugenics or selective mating as a way for society to breed its most qualified leaders [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Prominent sociologists including William James saw a hereditary basis for the appearance of Great Men within a society, in essence the product of Darwinian selection, wherein the “peculiar gifts” of the leader interact with the environment and social circumstances of the moment to push those individuals into action [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>].</Para>

            <Heading>Origins of Leadership Trait Theory</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par7" TextBreak="No">Great Man theories and the inherited leadership ideas espoused by Galton drove much of the research in this field in the early decades of the twentieth century. Scholarship was directed towards the identification of those specific or general personality characteristics, motives, and behaviors – <Emphasis Type="Italic">leadership traits</Emphasis> – that differentiated leaders from non-leaders, irrespective of whether those leadership traits were inherited or acquired [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Whereas Great Man theories held that the course of history was determined by the actions of a small number of extraordinary men possessing extraordinary inherited skills, leadership trait theory attempted to define and validate a list of traits that acted singly or in combination to produce leaders [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par8" TextBreak="No">As a scientific approach was adopted by the emerging disciplines of psychology and sociology, a number of methodological issues with leadership trait theory became evident. Cowley, working at the University of Chicago, noted three specific concerns [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. The first problem was the difficulty of establishing a clear definition of leadership, specifically the challenge of distinguishing “actual and unquestionable leaders” from those he termed “headmen”, individuals who are called leaders because they have a certain pedigree or certain characteristics that allow them to occupy positions of leadership (leadership role occupancy) but who do not in fact have true leadership qualities, outstanding motives, or clear direction. The second concern noted by Cowley was that individual traits associated with a given leadership (or headship) role seemed to vary from situation to situation. At one level, these situational differences merely reflected the specific job qualifications needed for leadership role occupancy. For example, in order to lead (or head) a department of surgery, one must have completed medical school and surgical residency training, passed board examinations, and so on. At a deeper level, it became clear that individual personality traits and skills possessed by leaders could not be defined independently of the requirements of the specific situation; certain traits appeared to be valued more highly in certain circumstances whereas they might be of little value in others. Thus, a study of leadership could not be confined to leadership traits in isolation but must also take into account the context of the specific leadership situation. This led to the third concern identified by Cowley, which was the challenge of defining that subset of <Emphasis Type="Italic">generalizable</Emphasis> leadership traits that were applicable in <Emphasis Type="Italic">all</Emphasis> situations. Cowley approached these three concerns through experimentation. For example, he administered standardized psychological tests to leaders and followers in three different settings, comparing officers and privates in the U.S. army, criminal leaders and gang members in a state penitentiary, and student leaders and student followers at the University of Chicago. He found that while standardized tests could reasonably discriminate leaders and followers <Emphasis Type="Italic">within</Emphasis> the same environmental situation, leadership traits appeared to differ considerably <Emphasis Type="Italic">between</Emphasis> situations.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par9" TextBreak="No">Leadership trait theory began to fall out of favor due to the many inconsistencies in the evidence base. In the decades that followed Stogdill’s notable 1948 review, most psychology and sociology textbooks de-emphasized or outright rejected leadership trait theory [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. Amid increasing skepticism that the essence of leadership could be captured solely in the possession of specific character traits, behavioral theories of leadership that emphasized situation-specific factors began to emerge. As summarized by Fielder [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>], a number of important conceptual advances were made during this period. Among these was the idea of <Emphasis Type="Italic">emergent leadership</Emphasis>, in which individuals possessing the right degree of visibility and the right combination of skills and resources that matched the needs or goals of a group would be the most likely to emerge as acceptable leaders. In this view, there is no universal set of traits or personality that determine leadership of a group; good leaders in one situation may just as easily be good followers in another. Another important advance was the debunking of gender and race differences in leadership. Other insights included the recognition of the importance of group dynamics, including the behavior of leaders towards subordinates, the structure of group roles, and the explicit or implicit attribution of motives to leaders and followers. Leadership was increasingly conceived as a more transactional framework, reflecting the complex interactions that occur among individuals within a group as well as the specific situational context.</Para>

            <Heading>Modern View of Leadership Trait Theories</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par10" TextBreak="No">Leadership trait theory has made somewhat of a comeback in recent years [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. Models of charismatic and transformational leadership that emerged in the 1980s, while acknowledging the importance of situational context, began to refocus attention on the personal qualities and attributes of leaders that enabled their effectiveness [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. It is now generally accepted that while no single set of traits or personality type can reliably predict which individuals will become leaders, certain personal characteristics and qualities under a given set of circumstances do positively (or negatively) contribute to the likelihood of leader success [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par11" TextBreak="No">A number of conceptual difficulties with modern leadership trait theory remain to be resolved. Much of the earlier work on leadership took a univariate approach, failing to consider the importance of combinations of traits and attributes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. However, even when multivariate analysis is attempted, there remain significant challenges in quantifying the relative expression of a given trait or combination of traits. Moreover, the relationship of a given trait to leadership may not be linear, and the contribution of multiple traits may or may not be additive. The relative contributions of leadership traits may differ with respect to leader emergence, leadership role occupancy, or leadership effectiveness. It may also be difficult to distinguish effective leaders from other high-performing individuals [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par12" TextBreak="No">A persistent problem with leadership trait theory has been the lack of a uniformly accepted taxonomic framework [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. Different researchers have used different terminologies to describe different aspects of personality and other attributes that might relate to leadership. For example, Stogdill’s influential review [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>] listed eight traits that correlated with leadership: dependability, sociability, initiative, persistence, self-confidence, alertness, cooperativeness, and adaptability. On the other hand, Mann listed five different traits: adjustment, extroversion, dominance, masculinity, and conservatism [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par13" TextBreak="No">Part of the challenge stems from ambiguities in the definition of “trait” itself, a term that is applied in various ways to personality, temperament, abilities, and even individual physical and demographic attributes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. The term trait is most narrowly applied to describe habitual, consistent, predictable patterns of behavior that are independent of the situational context. In this sense, <Emphasis Type="Italic">leadership traits</Emphasis> might be best defined as a coherent combination of personal characteristics that foster leadership effectiveness across a variety of groups and situations [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. Leadership traits reflect not only personality but also a variety of other qualities that are expressed to differing degrees in leaders and non-leaders. Some of these traits may be innate while others may be acquired or developed. As such, one must accept an inevitable degree of overlap between personal attributes and the various skills, competencies, and expertise that are necessary for successful leadership [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>].</Para>
          </Section1>
          <Section1 ID="Sec5">
            <Heading>Leadership Traits</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par14" TextBreak="No">Kirkpatrick and Locke [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>], in reviewing several decades of writings on leadership, outlined six categories of traits that appeared to differentiate leaders from non-leaders: drive, the desire to lead, honesty/integrity, self-confidence, cognitive ability, and knowledge of the business. Later, Zaccaro [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>] developed a more refined model that grouped leader attributes into integrated sets that depended to differing degrees on the situational context (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">5.1</InternalRef>): cognitive abilities, personality and disposition, motivation and values, social capacities, and leader expertise and tacit knowledge. Some of these attributes, such as cognitive abilities, are envisioned as more foundational and less amenable to development or training. Others, such as social capacities, or expertise and tacit knowledge, are seen as experiential and learned. <Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab1">

Studies that specifically test intelligence consistently show higher performance by leaders, and this correlation stands as an independent factor when evaluated by multivariable analysis. In isolation, the correlation between intellectual abilities and leadership performance is imperfect. For example, in studies of military leaders, high intelligence was undermined under circumstances of high stress or emergencies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. General intelligence is most associated with leadership performance when linked with at least one other leadership attribute, and the association is stronger when more complex measures of analytical ability are factored in.

            <Para ID="Par17" TextBreak="No">Neuroticism (manifest as anxiety, insecurity, and sometimes irritability and hostility) negatively correlates with leadership [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. On the other hand, personality traits that reflect a low degree of neuroticism such as self-esteem are predictive of leadership. Extroversion is the strongest and most consistent trait that has been positively linked to leadership, whereas agreeableness shows the weakest correlation. Studies that have used Myers-Brigg indicators confirm the association with extroversion. However, studies of military leaders have shown preferences for sensing, thinking, and judging, whereas business executives may also show a preference for intuition, which may correlate with communication style [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Among the challenges of the study of leadership traits is observer bias: the ability to distinguish self <Emphasis Type="Italic">versus</Emphasis> observer ratings of personality [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]. Another challenge is that of attribution bias, in the sense that the personality traits of individuals are assessed through stereotypical assumptions about the characteristics of leaders [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par18" TextBreak="No">Drive (which includes achievement, ambition, energy, tenacity, and initiative) has been emphasized as a particularly important leadership trait [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Motivation to lead appears to reflect a need for power or dominance. The extent to which motivation and drive correlate with leader effectiveness or leader achievement varies from study to study, and appears to be difficult to isolate from the impact of cognitive abilities and personality profile [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par19" TextBreak="No">Social appraisal and interpersonal skills are particularly critical leadership traits [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Also known as social intelligence, the ability to understand and respond effectively to the feelings, thoughts, and behaviors of members of a group consistently correlates with leader emergence and leader effectiveness across a range of both military and civilian settings. Emotional intelligence is a related social appraisal and interpersonal skill that comprises self-awareness and self-control. Emotional intelligence appears to strongly correlate with leadership, leader work outcome, and subordinate work outcome.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par20" TextBreak="No">The final category of leadership attributes is leader expertise and tacit knowledge. Practical intelligence, which by definition comes from experience, correlates closely with leadership emergence, but whether the ability to learn from experience is an innate or acquired leader quality has not been extensively investigated.</Para>

            <Heading>Genetic Evidence for Inherited Leadership Traits</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par21" TextBreak="No">Behavioral research indicates, perhaps not surprisingly, that personality traits are dependent upon both genetic and environmental factors [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. Galton reviewed the pedigree of 100 individuals he characterized as great men and concluded that greatness ran in families [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. Over the next hundred years, substantial evidence was obtained in support of the heritability of certain personality traits. However, differentiation of genetically inherited traits from traits that develop because of inherited environmental factors (<Emphasis Type="Italic">e.g.</Emphasis>, socioeconomic) may not be straightforward. Moreover, it is only relatively recently that genetic research methodologies have been more specifically applied to the study of leadership.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par22" TextBreak="No">One of the first such studies examined self-reported psychometric inventories relevant to leadership in monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twins [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. Higher-level leadership factors showed significant heritability. The genetic influence was particularly strong for factors that reflected transformational leadership such as inspirational motivation, attributed charisma, idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration. However, factors associated with transactional leadership such as active or passive management-by-exception and contingent awards also showed heritability. Subsequent studies have shown that all of the big five personality factors show genetic heritability [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. Notably, genes involved in regulating brain dopamine levels appear to be associated with extroversion, a trait itself strongly associated with leadership.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par23" TextBreak="No">Overall, studies using classical twin methodology have estimated that about one third of the variance in leadership role occupancy (defined as holding a position or office with leadership functions) can be explained by genetic factors [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. This degree of genetic variation is roughly equivalent between male and female populations [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. Environmental, experiential, and other non-shared factors between twin pairs appear to account for the rest of the variation. These studies confirm the prevailing opinion of current leadership scholars that leadership represents a complex dynamic between inherited and acquired factors, a balance between “nature and nurture” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. However, the majority of such studies have examined leadership role occupancy rather than leader effectiveness.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par24" TextBreak="No">Recent data have extended initial observations of the heritability of leadership traits in twins to identify specific genes that correlate with leadership role occupancy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. Several thousand genetic markers known to impact brain development, neurotransmitter biology, and hormonal regulation were evaluated in a large twin cohort as well as an independent sample drawn from the Framingham Heart Study. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the neuronal acetylcholine receptor gene <Emphasis Type="Italic">CHRNB3</Emphasis> was found to correlate with occupancy of leadership positions. This particular gene was evaluated because of its known association with impulsive behavior and its ability to modulate midbrain dopamine release.</Para>

            <Heading>Conclusions</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par25" TextBreak="No">Popular wisdom has held for centuries that certain individuals are “born to lead”. However, the scientific underpinnings of this concept, starting with Great Man Theories, have been weak from an evidentiary standpoint. Leadership trait theory, which emerged in the early part of the twentieth century, was largely eclipsed by behavioral and situational theories. Trait theory was undermined by a variety of methodological and theoretical challenges including difficulties in the definition of leadership traits, differences among leadership traits in different situational contexts, observer bias, and difficulties in objective measurement. In addition to the lack of experimental evidence, Great Man and leadership trait theories fell out of favor due to troubling sociopolitical implications of racism, sexism, and eugenics. The modern emphasis on leadership development – that “anybody” can become a leader given the right situation and the right training – became more socially acceptable in the post-WWII world. In recent years, the pendulum has swung back towards a more intermediate position with the emergence of genetic data suggesting that a modest amount of variation in leadership traits and leadership role occupancy can be accounted for by hereditary factors. However, the majority of the variation in leadership traits among individuals in a given population appear to reflect differences in experience, environment, and, perhaps, training.</Para>
