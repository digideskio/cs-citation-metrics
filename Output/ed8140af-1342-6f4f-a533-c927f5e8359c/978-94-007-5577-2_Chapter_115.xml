              <Para>The present paper describes the some results of the modelling system for operational response to accidental releases of harmful gases in the atmosphere (as a result of terrorist attack or industrial accident). The system is based on the following models: WRF, used as meteorological pre-processor; SMOKE – the emission pre-processor; CMAQ – the Chemical Transport Model (CTM) of the system. For the needs of the emergency response preparedness mode the risk is defined as probability the national regulatory threshold values for toxic gases to be exceeded. Maps of the risk around potential sources of emergency toxic gas releases are constructed and demonstrated in the present paper. Some examples of the system “operational mode” results are demonstrated as well.</Para>

              <Para>The present work demonstrates results produced by the Bulgarian system for emergency response in case of accidental harmful releases in the atmosphere. The system will supply the authorities, the relevant international organisations and the public with information, which will help to take proper measures for diminishing the damages. The modelling system is able to assist emergency managers in three stages:</Para>
              <Para>In preparedness mode, “risk analysis” was performed for some selected sites These assessments can be of a direct use for the relevant national bodies for developing strategies for immediate emergency response (for example evacuation of people from the pollution exposed regions, proper assignment of medical teams) in order to minimize the pollution impact on human health. They also give valuable information for optimisation of the air quality monitoring network.</Para>
              <Para>In the operational (“fast decision”) mode the system produces fast short-term forecast of the pollutant propagation in local and regional scale, which is governed by the meteorological conditions. This information will help the authority decisions about the immediate measures and activities to be carried out in order to minimize the pollution impact on human health.</Para>
              <Para>The modelling tool used for this study is US EPA Models-3 System: WRF [<CitationRef CitationID="CR01151">1</CitationRef>], used as meteorological pre-processor, CMAQ [<CitationRef CitationID="CR01152">2</CitationRef>] – the Chemical Transport Model of the system.; SMOKE [<CitationRef CitationID="CR01153">3</CitationRef>] – the emission pre-processor. A chlorine chemical mechanism has been added to CMAQ based on [<CitationRef CitationID="CR01154">4</CitationRef>].</Para>

              <Para>The risk may generally be defined as a product of probability (recurrence) of happening of a given event and the impact of this event (in the particular case on human health). The impact should be evaluated by some metrics directly giving the effect of toxic gas on human health – in this case the national regulatory threshold values, so the risk is simply the probability these thresholds to be exceeded.</Para>
              <Para>The industrial site, for which the risk analysis results will be demonstrated is “POLIMERI-DEVNYA” located close to the Black sea. The simulations were carried out for two release times – 2 o’clock and 14 o’clock local time in three nested, covering respectively the regions of South-Eastern Europe, Bulgaria, and the area surrounding the site, downscaling the problem to a horizontal resolution of 1 km around the site. It should be noted that the “regular” emissions are also taken into account not only in the innermost domain, but also in the domain with spatial resolution of 5 km (Bulgaria) thus providing appropriate boundary conditions for the innermost domain.</Para>
              <Para>The simulations were carried out for years 2000–2007 day by day for several hours after the release and thus a large ensemble of simulations was obtained. For each individual run it was checked up where the respective concentration exceeds the regulatory threshold value and so the impact is set equal to 1, and in the points where the concentrations are below the regulatory threshold, the impact value is set equal to zero. Then a simple statistics over this ensemble gives the probability the regulatory threshold to be exceeded – the risk.</Para>
              <Para>The probabilities surface concentration fields of Cl<Subscript>2</Subscript> (the primary pollutant) and HCl (one of the secondary pollutants) to exceed the respective threshold values are calculated for the four seasons and for the whole year. Due to the limited volume of the paper only the annual risk will be demonstrated here (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig01151">115.1</InternalRef>). <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig01151">

              <Para>There are several things about the probability fields that should be mentioned: The area with non-zero probabilities could cover a big domain around the “POLIMERI-DEVNYA” site. This is another good demonstration why the risk assessment is necessary. It can be seen that significant risk could happen far from the site and with temporal delay. The probability fields are quite different for the different seasons, which yet again demonstrates the importance of the meteorological conditions for the pollution field pattern. The probability field pattern is pretty complex for both Cl<Subscript>2</Subscript> and HCl, still a tendency for spreading the pollution in E-W direction could be seen, which reflects the local circulation patterns. In summer, due to the vicinity of the Black Sea, there is a breeze circulation, so during daytime the plume moves inland, while during night time the plume moves towards the sea. The closest neighbouring cities are under threat – Devnya (large probability during warm daytime conditions) and Varna (during the night or in winter). Some of the roads at certain time could be rather risky, so they should not be used for evacuation of the population. Such roads are both the highway and the T1 road from Devnya to Varna, if the accident happens at night-time or in winter, or the same roads in the opposite direction (Devnya-Shumen) if it happens during daytime in spring and summer. The secondary pollutant concentrations may also exceed the regulatory threshold – for example HCl concentrations are high during spring and summer.</Para>

              <Para>A specially developed Fortran program, that produces tracer emissions for the 11 locations in the domain of the chemical transport model. The system runs operatively at 00, 06, 12, 18 UTC every day and works in the following way: First, the meteorological input data is downloaded from NCEP and the WRF input files are prepared. Then the meteorological model is run for 15 h, with four nested domains. The first 6 h of the simulation are a spin-up and the next 9 h are processed to become meteorological input for the chemical transport model. Then the CMAQ model is run for 9 h. As an output of the system a series of images are produced, showing the 11 tracer concentrations at 15-min intervals for 9 h. The meteorological simulations are carried out in four nested domains with resolutions 90, 30, 6, 2 km, downscaling from the region of South-Eastern Europe (90 km) to Bulgaria (2 km). The CMAQ simulations are carried out only in the innermost domain.</Para>

                      <Para>The shape of the plumes and the direction of their movement are governed by the meteorological conditions. Since there are no chemical reactions, the changes in the pollutant concentrations are only due to dispersion and deposition.</Para>

                      <Para>The local meteorological wind circulation can be very different than the mesoscale and this yet again confirms the need of high resolution. This is especially true for areas with complex terrain, like southern Bulgaria. The breeze circulation at the coast of the Black Sea during the warm months is also important – it can contribute to cleansing the air (when the wind is blowing from the west) or to high pollutant concentrations inland (when the wing is blowing from the east).</Para>

                      <Para>The simulations show, that if there are strong winds or the thermodynamic conditions are unstable, the surface concentrations drop five times in 2 h, but this is a rare case. In most simulations the concentrations remain high at least 3 h after the release. For some sites in some simulations the toxic plumes remain almost stationary and the surface concentrations remain high for more than 2 h.</Para>

              <Para>Some of the sites are very close to big cities (Varna, Burgas, Rousse) and major roads or railway lines, so the emergency simulations could be really useful, showing if the plume approaches a region with dense population. Even cities, which are more than 20 km away from the source, can be under threat.</Para>

              <Para>The work on the risk evaluation and emergency response system is not completed yet. At this stage of the system development, however, it can be concluded that the chosen modelling tools are probably suitable for this particular task and the obtained preliminary results are quite realistic and promising. The shown numerical results very well demonstrate the practical value of the preparedness and fast decision mode of the system.</Para>
