            <Para ID="Par3" TextBreak="No">Leadership in the first few years of training is about leading yourself. In order to achieve your goals, you must first define them. Take a look at the big picture and determine what you are passionate about. An individual is more likely to be successful if they are driven by a passion for the work they are doing. Once you have defined your area of interest, it may be useful to start developing a purpose statement. This statement should be simple and clearly describe the purpose of your career. This can help anchor you in the work you are about to undertake as well as aid in mapping out the goals you wish to accomplish.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par4" TextBreak="No">Goal setting, both short- and long-term, is an important part of this process and should include a plan and a timeline to achieve the appropriate milestones. You may want to consider your goals in different aspects of your job. For example, you may want to write out your goals in the clinical, research, and educational arenas. It is also important to prioritize your goals. As you begin to work, make sure you put high priority items first and strive to achieve the early wins. Once you have these documents, be sure to file them in a place that you can revisit and even reconsider periodically to help you stay on track.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par5" TextBreak="No">The objective of the above project is not to turn your passion into some mundane job but rather to ensure you are clear with your purpose. If you do not begin with the end in mind, you will never reach your goals [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. No one is going to reach a major career accomplishment overnight. By breaking down your purpose statement into specific, attainable goals, you are more likely to build a rewarding career.</Para>

            <Heading>Be an Opportunist</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par6" TextBreak="No">Early on in one’s academic career things seem to be “done to you”. That is, many of the assignments you are given are not the result of you seeking out the opportunity, but rather because someone in your hierarchy has recommended you for the task. These duties might include being a member of a particularly tedious or busy committee. It is easy to see these types of activities as obligations. Your challenge is to see this as an opportunity to show your superiors that you are up to the task and that you will take on these challenges to the best of your ability [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. Meeting these mundane demands with a positive attitude and a strong work ethic will not only look good, but it will also make the task much less tedious. Seeing these obligations as opportunities will ensure you have success early on in your career [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par7" TextBreak="No">There are other benefits to these early assignments. They will help you gain more insight about how your institution or professional society functions so that you are better able to navigate the resources you will need to reach your own goals. You may also find that collaborating in this way will highlight areas in your own professional life that you will need to develop in order to be successful. Leading yourself implies that you are continually working on your weaknesses. Everyone has some part of themselves that they would like to change. Understanding and acknowledging these weaknesses early will be a key to your long-term success. Therefore, you must make a plan to work on it and strive to improve.</Para>

            <Heading>Optimize Efficiency</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par8" TextBreak="No">In 1913, Sir William Osler delivered an address to Yale students entitled, “A Way of Life” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. In this address, he urged the students to be successful by living for the day. He stated, “Now the way of life that I preach is a habit to be acquired gradually by long and steady repetition. It is the practice of living for the day only, and for the day’s work, life in day tight compartments.” Leading yourself involves living your life in the day-tight compartments described by Sir William Osler. The day-tight compartment philosophy encourages people to think about how to put each day into the context of your long-term goals. By maximizing your time to the fullest each day in this regard, you will ultimately reach those milestones.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par9" TextBreak="No">Effective time management is intrinsic in learning to live your life in day-tight compartments. Essentially, this means that you are taking advantage of each minute to get work accomplished. However, efficiency is a skill that comes with experience, and you must continually assess your time and how it is used. This means you must be both in control of your schedule and adhere to it. While you may have an administrative assistant keeping your daily schedule and helping arrange both patient and academic appointments, you must be intimately involved in how that template is built and managed. Remember your assistant works to help you be more efficient, and (s)he will schedule based upon the parameters you set. Consider meeting with your assistant weekly and going over your schedule for the week. Be clear on what time can be used for meetings or clinical responsibilities, as well as what time you will be protecting for other academic projects. Make certain that your assistant sees the importance of this work; this individual can be an ally.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par10" TextBreak="No">If you do not have an administrative assistant to help with this process, designing your weekly schedule will become even more important. It is easy to want to be accommodating early in your career to help support colleagues and collaborators. Good leaders should be willing to lend a hand; however, it is important to be realistic. You will not be able to accomplish your goals if you do not allow yourself the time to do so, and you will not be of much assistance if you cannot complete the work you agree to help with. This comes back to the idea of leading yourself. Are you someone who needs dedicated, uninterrupted time to review a manuscript, or draft a grant? If that is the case, you need to be certain to provide that time not only to ensure the work is completed, but also to reduce the amount of work hours that bleed into your personal life.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par11" TextBreak="No">In addition to keeping control of your schedule, you must use your time to its fullest. This means that any downtime in your schedule should be used to accomplish some of the mundane tasks of your day—completing paperwork, signing charts, dictating, etc. These are tasks that cannot be let go. In fact, the timely completion of these mundane tasks is a direct reflection of your professionalism and not doing them will result in much bigger problems for you than failure to get promoted. One way to ensure efficiency and timeliness in completing these tasks is to work to complete them as soon as possible. Dictate an operation as soon as it has been completed; dictate each patient encounter immediately after finishing; sign charts as soon as they are available, etc. These simple guidelines will ensure that your charts stay up to date and that the hospital can efficiently bill for your services. Furthermore, much of the signing of charts can be done while waiting for the operating room to be turned over or while waiting to see the next patient in clinic. There are always a few minutes in between different activities that allow for some of this mundane work to be accomplished. Find a way to use those minutes to your benefit; rather than see a negative in the turnover time, see the positive in that the turnover allowed you to get all of your charts signed or your clinic dictated.</Para>

          <Section1 ID="Sec5">
            <Heading>Be Positive</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par12" TextBreak="No">The downfall of many young academic surgeons is negativity. An overly negative perspective can change the way you view every task and in the long-term can hurt your productivity. Furthermore, negativity can change the way your colleagues and superiors view you. They will be much more hesitant to provide you with opportunities to shine, reserving those activities for people who will meet the task with a good attitude and a penchant for success. The opportunist approach will ultimately give rise to leadership opportunities as people begin to realize your potential. If you are seen as an individual who approaches obligations as opportunities for growth and success, you are more likely to be perceived as a role model to others in your department, and this will not go unrecognized by the senior leaders in your institution [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par13" TextBreak="No">In addition to leading to more opportunities, staying positive will allow people to see you as someone who they want to follow. A positive person is generally someone who can generate energy and engage others. Attracting the best candidates and engaging them in the work will be a highly significant factor as you work to advance your agenda. It is much easier to attract the top people if you are the kind of collaborator they want to work with.</Para>

          <Section1 ID="Sec6">
            <Heading>Engage the Team</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par14" TextBreak="No">Engagement of the team is a critical skill that you must learn as you begin to obtain leadership positions. A team that is engaged with your vision is much more likely to work effectively towards the goals you have set. How does one go about engaging a team? This can be a very difficult task, but it can be broken down into four simple steps: <OrderedList>
                <ListItem>
                  <ItemNumber>1.</ItemNumber>
                  <ItemContent>
                    <Para ID="Par15" TextBreak="No">Provide a clear vision that includes everyone in its success. You will need to effectively communicate your vision for the team so that they have a complete understanding of why they are working towards the goal you have put forth. Without this clarity, the team will lose sight of the goal, potentially become distracted by unrelated issues, and will ultimately fail. Remember that if your vision is shared it will be much easier to engage your team. If they clearly see the importance of what they are doing, they will work tirelessly to achieve the goals. Don’t be afraid to remind them of the importance of their tasks.</Para>
                  </ItemContent>
                </ListItem>
                <ListItem>
                  <ItemNumber>2.</ItemNumber>
                  <ItemContent>
                    <Para ID="Par16" TextBreak="No">Encourage the team’s progress. As they work hard to achieve the standard you have set, you must remember to give them encouragement along the way. This can be as simple as a word or something as big as a team dinner to celebrate a win. Whatever you do, don’t forget to be a champion for your team.</Para>
                  </ItemContent>
                </ListItem>
                <ListItem>
                  <ItemNumber>3.</ItemNumber>
                  <ItemContent>
                    <Para ID="Par17" TextBreak="No">Set new challenges. Challenging existing processes along the way can be a key factor in successful innovation. Many projects fail because of adherence to the status quo. As you are working towards your goals, you may want to improve one aspect of the machinery you have put in place. Don’t be afraid to challenge something you think might be broken. In fact, use these opportunities to stimulate your team to improve and be creative with the process.</Para>
                  </ItemContent>
                </ListItem>
                <ListItem>
                  <ItemNumber>4.</ItemNumber>
                  <ItemContent>
                    <Para ID="Par18" TextBreak="No">Provide a collaborative environment. Remember that mistakes are going to happen. How your team addresses those mistakes is going to define your success. If they see you as an effective collaborator, issues that come up can become new opportunities. If your team is afraid to raise these concerns, opportunities for growth can be lost. This collaborative environment develops out of the identity you build as a leader which we will explore further in this chapter.</Para>
                  </ItemContent>
                </ListItem>
              </OrderedList>
            </Para>
            <Para ID="Par19" TextBreak="No">Ultimately, your team is going to be much more engaged if they believe in the success of the project, your ability as a collaborator to lead them there, and your ability to create a positive work environment during the process. Effective team engagement is a priceless resource as you build your career.</Para>
          </Section1>
          <Section1 ID="Sec7">
            <Heading>Sense of Identity</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par20" TextBreak="No">It is important that you begin to develop you sense of identity as a leader early on and that your team can identify with each other. Initially this may mean having your surgical team over to your home for dinner or creating a logo for a skull cap and purchasing one for every member of your surgical team. The purpose of this activity is to begin to create a sense of camaraderie and develop loyalty between you and your staff. This type of commitment will carry the team through all the myriad ups and downs of managing a successful practice as well as establishing you as a more dependable leader.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par21" TextBreak="No">Your identity as a leader is not just about the team environment. Mentorship includes providing effective feedback to those who work with you and is a vitally important skill that you must start to develop early on in your career. Providing helpful critiques of a person’s performance implies that you understand what their job entails, that you want them to be successful, and that you have expectations for them that you will hold them accountable for. The term “providing feedback” frequently has negative connotations, but this is not just about correcting negative behaviors. Positive feedback is just as valuable because it encourages an individual to work hard, to continue exhibiting those traits you value, and allows them to see you as a resource for their job performance. Your willingness to provide effective feedback will help you stand out as a leader and potentially provide even more leadership opportunities.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par22" TextBreak="No">Once you have developed your sense of team identity, you must start to share your vision with those around you. This might be your vision to increase your case volume, your vision to advance your joint research program, or your vision to develop a new educational program. Irrespective of the direction of the vision, the goal of sharing this vision is two-fold. First, it will help inspire people to work in a collaborative fashion. However, this can only be accomplished if you remember to keep the goals of those around you in mind as well. If your vision aligns with what others want, your colleagues and team members will be much more likely to be engaged in your success. On the other hand, forcing your will on people can create underlying resentment which will show in the work.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par23" TextBreak="No">Second, clearly defining an identity that is in line with your career goals will help your colleagues identify you when new opportunities open up. For example, if your vision is to increase your case volume, your colleagues may wish to refer their extra volume to you or make you aware of new community outreach activities.</Para>
          </Section1>
          <Section1 ID="Sec8">
            <Heading>Be Selfless</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par24" TextBreak="No">A good leader is one who is not afraid to jump in and work. If you are asking your team to do something particularly onerous, it is important to lead by example. This means that you might take more call than anyone else on faculty, you might teach more courses, give more lectures, do more cases, etc. The bottom line is that you must be willing to work as hard as everyone else if your colleagues are going to follow. This also means that you have to be willing to say “Yes.” Much too often a young faculty member is too busy worrying about her own progress and forgets that she is part of a larger community. If you fail to agree to take on responsibility, very soon responsibility will not come your way. A large part of being a leader is being willing to help when needed.</Para>
          </Section1>
          <Section1 ID="Sec9">
            <Heading>Involvement Outside of Your Institution</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par25" TextBreak="No">There are many national surgical societies that a young surgeon can join. It is easy to become overwhelmed by choice and never really find a home where you can get recognition and advance up the ranks. When joining national organizations, it is important to identify your strategy with these societies. That is, understand why you are joining them and what you hope to get out of your participation. While there is no clear right or wrong way to go about joining societies, if you have aspirations to lead in one of these organizations, you will increase your likelihood of success if you are strategic in your thinking.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par26" TextBreak="No">First, you will want to have a society that you call your home society. This is the organization you can relate to the most—AAES for an endocrine surgeon, ASCRS for a colon and rectal surgeon, etc. You will likely want to submit your research to this society and attend this meeting yearly. In addition, you should try to get involved right away with your home society, perhaps by volunteering for committee membership and following through by actively engaging in those committees. However, before you volunteer, think about your strengths and what you enjoy doing. For example, if you do not enjoy social media, do not volunteer for the website committee. Try to get on committees that you will enjoy and that play to your strengths. Remember, these are your colleagues on a national scale. Your successes, as well as your failures, in these endeavors will be noticed.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par27" TextBreak="No">In addition to a home society, you will likely want to be in other non-specialty societies. These might include the American College of Surgeons, the Association for Academic Surgery, Society of University Surgeons, and other general academic societies. The reason to consider joining these types of organizations is to broaden your friendship base and to gain more learning opportunities. Many of these organizations provide you with opportunities to lead committees early on, and these are invaluable experiences as they will provide mentorship as well as knowledge. These organizations also have resources to help you advance your career including courses on career development, grant writing, leadership, etc. Finally, these non-specialty organizations are often more friendly to trainees and provide a forum for your residents and students to present their work.</Para>
          </Section1>
          <Section1 ID="Sec10">
            <Heading>Ask for Help</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par28" TextBreak="No">Every good leader has many mentors he or she can point to over the years who have helped him or her achieve their goals. Asking these mentors for advice is a critical piece to improving leadership skills. Mentors can help you at every stage in your career and can be invaluable as you begin your leadership experience. In fact, the only mistake one can make is failing to ask for help when it is needed.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par29" TextBreak="No">In addition to asking your mentors for advice along the way, you may want to consider the importance of engaging others in your vision by asking them to take over important aspects of the task. Delegation is an important part of getting your team to own the project. However, when you delegate, make sure you follow up with your team member so that you can track progress and provide input as necessary. Effective delegation is an important leadership skill to learn.</Para>
          </Section1>
          <Section1 ID="Sec11">
            <Heading>Summary</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par30" TextBreak="No">We hope that the principles outlined above will help you build your leadership skills early in your academic career. Strong leadership of others depends upon the ability to effectively lead oneself. Recognizing your goals early in your career, being willing to develop your skills and improve weaknesses, as well as being able to effectively engage colleagues and team members will go a long way towards helping you find long-term success. Remember to take advantage of early opportunities as hard-work is quickly recognized by others. Early success in these areas will lead to significant leadership opportunities as your identity as a leader is recognized by others.</Para>
