            <Para ID="Par1">Constitutive relations for describing the biomechanical behavior of arteries have continued to progress since the late 1960s and we now have considerable ability to understand and predict many mechanical and mechanobiological processes. Nevertheless, advances in both genetics and cell and matrix biology have revealed new needs with regard to describing the biomechanics. In this chapter, we briefly review arterial structure and prior biomechanical constitutive approaches and then discuss a growing appreciation of the details of the arterial extracellular matrix and the need to include such detail in future constitutive relations. As it will be seen, much has been learned, yet much remains to be accomplished in the formulation of constitutive relations for arteries that can provide true predictive capability with regard to mechanobiological aspects of the development, maintenance, adaptation, disease progression, and responses to injury.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par2">Vascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized nations and its impact continues to increase worldwide. That mechanics is fundamental to understanding arterial health and disease is obvious—these vessels serve as structural conduits and loss of structural integrity can result in a life-threatening hemorrhage. Just as important, however, mechanics influences the workload on the heart and it affects fundamental cellular activities that influence the development, maintenance, adaptation, and repair of arteries in diverse physiologic and pathophysiologic circumstances. Hence, there is strong motivation to understand both the mechanics and the mechanobiology.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par3">There have been tremendous advances over the past four decades in arterial biomechanics (cf. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>]), yet recent advances in genetics and cell and matrix biology demand that we advance further our biomechanical understanding of arterial function and dysfunction. In this chapter, we will first review basic arterial structure and prior constitutive approaches for describing observed biomechanical behaviors of arteries. With this as a background, we will then briefly review more detailed information on arterial microstructure and, within the context of an illustrative example, suggest that there is a need for a new class of multiscale biomechanical models for arterial mechanics. The latter is motivated primarily by the recently discovered importance of structural constituents within the wall that have not been included explicitly in prior constitutive modeling. The general implications of such modeling are much farther reaching, however.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par4">Arteries are generally classified as either elastic or muscular. Elastic arteries are found closer to the heart and function to store elastic energy during systole that can be used to work on the blood during diastole. This elastic response decreases the work load on the heart, augments coronary perfusion by aiding retrograde flow during diastole, and promotes a continuous flow in the microcirculation that aids in gas and nutrient exchange. Muscular arteries are found near or in target organs and tissues such as the heart, brain, kidneys, and skeletal muscle; via a strong smooth muscle contractile response, they regulate local blood pressure and flow. Both types of arteries consist of three layers: intima, media, and adventitia. The innermost layer, or intima, consists primarily of a monolayer of endothelial cells that adhere to an underlying basement membrane that consists largely of type IV collagen and laminin. Albeit not structurally significant in young healthy individuals, this layer can thicken in aging, particular diseases, and responses to injury primarily due to an accumulation of synthetic cells and deposition of abundant collagen and proteoglycans. The middle layer, or media, is the parenchymal layer of the arterial wall. It consists of abundant smooth muscle cells as well as elastic fibers, fibrillar collagens, and proteoglycans. In elastic arteries, the smooth muscle cells reside within concentric layers of elastic fibers that are organized into fenestrated sheets, or laminae. In muscular arteries, the smooth muscle cells reside within a more diffuse plexus of elastic fibers, collagen fibers, and proteoglycans, typically with overall delimiting inner and outer elastic laminae. The outermost layer, or adventitia, consists primarily of fibroblasts and the plexus of collagen fibers that they synthesize and maintain along with admixed elastic fibers and proteoglycans.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par5">In summary, despite regional differences that serve local functionality, the arterial wall consists primarily of three layers, three cell types (endothelial, smooth muscle, and fibroblasts), and three primary types of structural constituents (elastic fibers, fibrillar collagens, and proteoglycans)—see Wagenseil and Mecham [<CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>] for an excellent review. Of particular note, all three cell types are highly mechanosensitive [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>], hence understanding arterial mechanics is important for two reasons. First, arteries are subjected to continuous loading, including pulsatile blood pressure, and their structural integrity is fundamental to their function as conduits for blood flow; internal tears or fissures can lead to life threatening blood clots whereas dissections and transmural ruptures can lead to life-threatening bleeding. Second, because vascular cells are mechanosensitive, understanding the mechanical stimuli to which they are subjected is fundamental to understanding many of their biological responses, including migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Indeed, for this reason, the mechanics is fundamental to arterial development, homeostasis, adaptation, disease progression, and response to injury [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>].</Para>

            <Para ID="Par6">As noted many years ago by Y.C. Fung, one of the most important needs in biomechanics is identification of nonlinear constitutive equations for tissues that experience multiaxial loads in vivo (cf. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]). Arteries are prototypical of such tissues.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par7">
              <Emphasis Type="Italic">Phenomenological Relations</Emphasis>. The first class of stress–strain (constitutive) relations developed for arteries can be classified as phenomenological, that is, relations that describe observed responses primarily in pressure-diameter and axial force-length tests. Because of the ubiquitous nonlinear material behavior exhibited by arteries over finite deformations, an important advance realized in the late 1960s and the early 1970s was the use of the theory of finite elasticity to quantify arterial behavior. Early contributors in this regard included H. Demiray, Y.C. Fung, I. Mirsky, B. Simon, R. Vaishnav, and R. Vito, among others (cf. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>]). Briefly, in each case, these investigators sought to identify a strain energy function <Emphasis Type="Italic">W</Emphasis> that depended on an appropriate measure of the finite deformation, as, for example, the right Cauchy-Green tensor <Emphasis Type="Bold">C</Emphasis> or the Green strain tensor <Emphasis Type="Bold">E</Emphasis>. That is, given a functional form for <Emphasis Type="Italic">W</Emphasis>(<Emphasis Type="Bold">C</Emphasis>) or <Emphasis Type="Italic">W</Emphasis>(<Emphasis Type="Bold">E</Emphasis>), one could then compute the associated stress via established, general (e.g., based on the entropy inequality) constitutive relations, namely<Equation ID="Equ1">

              </InlineEquation> where <Emphasis Type="Italic">Q</Emphasis> is typically written as a quadratic function of Green strain (note: by using a quadratic form, one can exploit material symmetry arguments from linearized elasticity, which is recovered directly in the limit as the strain becomes small). Although such relations can provide excellent estimates of the transmural distribution of wall stress, and indeed were fundamental in the discovery of the importance of residual stresses in arteries [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>], values of the best-fit material parameters (typically determined via nonlinear regression) do not have any physical meaning, which limits the interpretive value when comparing relations as a function of species, genotype, arterial location, age, adaptation, or disease status.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par8">
              <Emphasis Type="Italic">Structurally Motivated Relations</Emphasis>. For this reason, there was further motivation to pursue structurally motivated constitutive relations. Toward this end, there have been two basic approaches, both founded on the basic tenet that the overall stored energy <Emphasis Type="Italic">W</Emphasis> equals the sum of the energy stored in the structurally significant constituents that constitute the artery. First, building on the seminal paper by Lanir [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>], some groups have sought to develop constitutive relations that include mass fractions and distribution functions for the orientations of the fibrous constituents (e.g., elastic and collagen fibers) as well as possible functions that capture fiber undulation. A recent example of such an approach is Hollander et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. Given the microstructural complexity of arteries, as revealed by light, multiphoton, and scanning electrom microscopy, such models necessarily include many simplifying assumptions such as Gaussian distribution functions and lack of intra- and interconstituent interactions.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par9">Indeed, given the complexity of the microstructure, [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>] suggested a “hybrid approach” wherein phenomenological relations can be prescribed for individual constituents. This approach evolved to include single- [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>], two- [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>], and four- [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>] fiber family constitutive models; there does not appear to be any advantage to including additional families of fibers for arteries [<CitationRef CitationID="CR52">52</CitationRef>]. For example, the overall stored energy function <Emphasis Type="Italic">W</Emphasis> is often assumed to result from energy stored in an amorphous matrix plus that stored in locally parallel families of fibers, usually thought to be dominated by collagen. An initial motivation for such models was to correct a fundamental deficiency in so-called fiber-in-fluid models (cf. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]); an additional advantage is that such models also capture, with fewer parameters, the net effects of Gaussian distributions of fiber orientations (i.e., the preferred directions) and undulations (i.e., the exponential stiffening with stretch) as envisioned by Lanir [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>]. Indeed, these fiber family models easily admit the inclusion of distributions of fiber orientations as desired (cf. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR45">45</CitationRef>]), yet even without adding such capabilities these models have proven able to yield insight into constituent-dependent behaviors (cf. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]).</Para>
            <Para ID="Par10">
              <Emphasis Type="Italic">Extension to Growth and Remodeling</Emphasis>. Of particular importance here, the structure of these “hybrid” fiber family models allowed a straightforward extension to model the ability of an artery to grow and remodel in response to sustained changes in mechanical and chemical stimuli [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>]. By growth we mean a change in mass; by remodeling we mean a change in structure [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>]. For example, such growth and remodeling (G&amp;R) models can be constructed by assuming that the overall stored energy<Emphasis Type="Italic">W</Emphasis>is a sum of the energy stored in each structurally significant constituent as its turns over—that is, energy is stored in constituents until they are removed. For example, Valentin et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef>] suggested a form of <Emphasis Type="Italic">W</Emphasis>, where<Equation ID="Equ2">

The initial stages of aneurysm development are clinically silent; the lesion is typically discovered in its more advanced stages as a result of clinical symptoms (e.g., pain), targeted screening studies (usually by ultrasound), or imaging studies performed for other reasons. The most critical complication of AAAs is their propensity to rupture, which carries as much as a 90 % fatality rate. The only treatment options currently available are surgical, either by open replacement with a synthetic graft or endovascular placement of an endograft. A primary challenge for clinicians is to estimate the risk of rupture for a given AAA and to weigh that against the inherent risks of surgical intervention for a given patient. Unfortunately, accurately predicting patient-specific rupture risk remains challenging, and clinicians generally rely upon the maximum diameter (<InlineEquation ID="IEq22">

Nevertheless, some smaller aneurysms rupture while some larger aneurysms may remain unruptured throughout a patient’s remaining life. There is, therefore, a pressing need for a more accurate method of quantifying rupture risk in individual patients, which could reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with both the ruptures and potentially unnecessary surgeries in elderly patients.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par12">In the final analysis, AAAs rupture when wall stress exceeds wall strength. It has been shown that calculating wall stress via finite element models based on patient-specific geometries (and using phenomenological stress–strain relations) may yield a better estimate of rupture risk than the current metric of maximum diameter alone. This finding was an important advance, yet a patient-specific calculation of wall stress does not depend on luminal geometry alone. Stress depends on material properties and wall thickness, each of which may vary with location. Whereas one might be able to measure wall thickness by high-resolution imaging, defining the heterogeneous properties of the wall is much more difficult. As a first estimate, many investigators (see review by Humphrey and Holzapfel [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>]), assume uniform isotropic properties in the lesion and surrounding nondilated aorta. Furthermore, they assumed population-averaged material parameters based on in vitro biomechanical tests on AAA samples obtained from a small group of individuals, each at an unknown time during the natural history of the lesion. Of course, overall geometry (including thickness), properties, and hemodynamic loads also tend to evolve, hence calculating stresses based on a current medical image of a lesion (that has not yet ruptured) need not provide the most important information (cf. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>]), that is, the potential risk of rupture in the near future (e.g., within the 6-12 months until the next imaging session).</Para>
            <Para ID="Par13">In contrast, a G&amp;R model conceptually has the potential both to recover the current geometry (i.e., to match imaging data) and properties as well as to predict the future geometry of an AAA from an initially nondilated aorta while naturally evolving local wall stiffness and thickness consistent with observed changes in the evolving histology. There is, therefore, considerable motivation to develop such models [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>]. As a first step toward this goal, we constructed a G&amp;R model of idealized fusiform AAAs by beginning with an initially straight, nondilated aortic segment consisting of three primary load-bearing constituents: collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. The collagen mass was distributed into four families consistent with an aforementioned structurally motivated constitutive relation, with circumferential, axial, and paired symmetrically diagonal fibers. The elastin-dominated matrix was assumed to be amorphous whereas smooth muscle was oriented circumferentially. Mass fractions for each constituent (and fiber family) were then prescribed based on estimates from available histology and best fits to mechanical data [<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">47</CitationRef>]. Associated strain energy functions were also prescribed for each constituent, parameters for which were determined via nonlinear regressions of data. For example, the elastin was modeled via a neoHookean relation and the fibrillar collagen and smooth muscle were modeled using Fung-exponentials.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par14">An advantage of using constituent-specific relations is that one can numerically investigate contributions by individual constituents to the gross behavior. For example, one can study effects of stiffening the collagen via increased lysyl oxidase activity or glycosylation as in aging, remembering that AAAs typically present in elderly individuals. That is, mechanical properties of constituents, as represented by values of the material parameters, may be linked to a patient’s medical history (e.g., risk factors) and be allowed to evolve during the G&amp;R process according to general relationships. In particular, it is also hoped that once specific functional forms for the stored energy functions and associated ranges for the parameter values are well known from detailed biaxial data on selected specimens, patient-specific values may then be able to be inferred from the limited clinical data that will be available. To increase patient-specificity, data from which the ranges of parameters are obtained should come from samples covering the appropriate sex, age, smoking status, blood pressure, and so forth. One of the key challenges, nonetheless, will be assigning properties for the nonaneurysmal aorta from which the lesion developed given information after the patient presents with an AAA. Thus, there is also a need to correlate properties of the nonaneurysmal infrarenal aorta with more proximal sections.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par15">Once an appropriate data set is selected and the initial in vivo blood pressure and diameter are prescribed to establish an in vivo homeostatic reference configuration, nonlinear regression may be used to find best-fit values for the parameters of interest. A fundamental assumption of this approach is that a nonaneurysmal aorta will seek to maintain or restore a preferred homeostatic mechanical state (cf. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>]). That is, just as a cell seeks to establish and maintain a preferred chemical state via ion channels and pumps, we hypothesize that cells also synthesize, reorganize, and/or degrade structural constituents to establish, maintain, or restore a preferred mechanical state. Specifically, for our model, we assume that each constituent seeks to maintain a preferred Cauchy stress. Since our initial geometry is assumed to be a “healthy” initially nondilated aorta, we assume the constituents are initially at their respective homeostatic stresses. Moreover, because many proteins, notably collagen, are turning over constantly, we assume that the new collagen is incorporated within extant matrix at its preferred stress as the old collagen is removed.When such production and removal balance in an unchanging configuration, we call this tissue maintenance (or homeostasis). Because the original mass fractions, geometry, loads, and strain energy functions are all known, the appropriate “deposition stretch” for each constituent can be calculated from biaxial mechanical data along with the material parameters. It is then assumed that subsequently produced constituents will generally retain the same deposition stretch. Whereas the fibrillar collagen and smooth muscle turn over continuously throughout life, load-bearing elastic fibers within the elastic laminae are produced primarily during the perinatal period. Thus, the “deposition stretch” for elastin includes not only its initial deposition stretch, but also contributions due to somatic growth during development, maturation, and aging up to the time the simulation is to be initiated.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par16">The second class of constitutive relations must describe the new mass production. Based on the concept of preferred, or homeostatic, stress, we hypothesized that cells generate new constituents in proportion to the deviation of their current stress from the homeostatic level. That is, if cells “sense” an increase in stress during the progression of the AAA, new material will be produced at a greater rate in an attempt to reduce the stress back toward the homeostatic level. A gain-type parameter captures the robustness of this new mass production. As noted earlier, such G&amp;R models can also depend on effects due to far field stresses (e.g., smooth muscle cell production can depend on changes in wall shear stress on endothelial cells due to their altered production of nitric oxide or endothelin-1, which in turn affect smooth muscle production of collagen—see [<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef>]). Alternatively, one could couple reaction-diffusion models to the production models to account directly for mechano- and chemo-mediated changes in a host of molecules, including angiotensin-II, transforming growth factor—beta, and so forth, all of which affect smooth muscle production of collagen. Because collagen production and removal are continuous, even in the homeostatic state, a basal production rate must be included. This value is theoretically required to balance the basal degradation rate to ensure tissue maintenance under normal conditions and thus can be prescribed with some confidence. Finally, to account for the potential increase in the number of cells capable of producing collagen or smooth muscle, one could consider an additional term to augment production. For example, we have used the ratio of current mass to original mass (which assumes a near constant cell density), though more complex relationships could account for cellular proliferation, hypertrophy, or phenotypic changes. Overall, this constitutive relation for production provides a useful method for proposing and testing a number of competing hypotheses, from simple to complex, as to how cells transduce biochemomechanical stimuli into the production of load-bearing constituents.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par17">The final key class of constitutive relations is mass removal, which can include apoptosis/anoikis and degradation/damage. For healthy arteries, the basal degradation rate must balance the basal turnover. More challenging, however, is determination of increases in degradation rate in pathological conditions like AAA formation. Marked increases in serine proteases and matrix metalloproteinases have been observed in AAAs, which need not be uniform throughout the lesion. We have considered two general methods of removing mass heterogeneously: stress-dependent mechanical failure and enzymatic degradation. A basic relation to account for mechanical failure can be written as a function of a maximum stretch, stress, or strain energy that a constituent can bear. Beyond the defined maximum, the material is considered fragmented and unable to bear load. Since collagen and smooth muscle are constantly turning over during aneurysmal enlargement, these materials may be somewhat protected from mechanical failure as new material may replace older fibers prior to their reaching the higher loads. In rapidly expanding aneurysms, however, collagen may reach its failure point before it is removed. Clearly, if significant collagen mass is lost, the risk of rupture can increase significantly. On the other hand, elastin is considered not to turnover. As a result, it is much more susceptible to mechanical failure in an AAA, which can increase in diameter more than threefold. While elastin is difficult to isolate, the literature suggests an ultimate stretch of about 2.2, hence potential mechanical failure must be included. While our initial models assumed that elastin is removed completely upon mechanical failure, it is possible that fragmented elastin may continue to bear some load as well as occupy space (and thus contribute to wall thickness and affect stress) because of its highly cross-linked and interconnected structure. In fact, histological examination of large AAA samples have revealed regions still containing elastin, and some stress–strain data from mechanical tests of AAAs show an initially linear relationship in the low strain range that is classically attributed to the presence of elastic fibers. Interestingly, small fragments of elastin often referred to as elastin degradation products may also exert significant biological effects on surrounding cells by recruiting inflammatory cells, activating fibroblasts, and promoting angiogenesis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR49">49</CitationRef>]. Clearly, further research and modeling efforts are needed to capture better these complexities.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par18">As briefly mentioned earlier, degradation of matrix proteins is accomplished by a variety of enzymes (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases, elastases, and cathepsins). As a useful first approximation, we modeled such degradation using a first-order type decay defined as a function of half-life. It is reported that elastin has a normal half-life of approximately 50 to 70 years, though much shorter in pathological states like AAAs. While we often prescribe an initial spatial loss of elastin to initiate AAA development [<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">47</CitationRef>], the remaining elastin continues to degrade according to the prescribed first-order decay. Potentially, the relationship defining the half-life of this decay could be a function of the distribution and activation of particular elastases, such as neuthrophil elastase derived from inflammatory cells infiltrating the wall and located within the luminal layer of the often present intraluminal thrombus, as well as other elastases released by macrophages and smooth muscle cells within the wall. Similarly, we have allowed smooth muscle to turnover via a first-order relation. Losses of smooth muscle should include the phenomenon of anoikis, in which cells undergo apoptosis in response to lost connections with their surrounding matrix. In AAAs, anoikis may be of particular importance as the elastic laminae, in which the smooth muscle cells are normally in intimate contact, are proteolytically degraded or mechanically damaged. Indeed, smooth muscle cell apoptosis is a key pathological feature of AAAs. Thus, in addition to the first-order decay, we also allow the loss of SMCs to be proportional to the loss of elastin.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par19">Finally, a critical component to the integrity of the aortic wall is the rate of degradation of collagen, particularly in aneurysms where the majority of the elastin and SMCs have been lost. Three main components have been considered in the enzymatic degradation of collagen. First, we include a baseline degradation rate that is balanced by the baseline production rate. Second, modification of this baseline rate due to effects from the production of collagenases by inflammatory cells, such as in the intraluminal thrombus or invading from the vasa vasorum [<CitationRef CitationID="CR48">48</CitationRef>]. Third, changes in this rate may be due to changes in the current stress state of the collagen fibers; that is, underloading (or potentially overloading) collagen may affect the rate at which collagenases are able to attack the molecule. There is, however, a need for improved understanding and quantification of the many biochemomechanical factors in the degradation of collagen, including identification of relevant collagenases, diffusion rates of these enzymes, kinematic relationships for enzymatic effectiveness as a function of stress and other factors.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par20">Defining the evolving properties of the aortic wall on the level of individual constituents, as opposed to a static description of the whole wall as a single material, potentially allows a greater understanding of the processes that govern the growth and remodeling of healthy and diseased arteries. In addition, defining the strain energies, productions, and removals as separate functions (each drawing from quantifiable biochemical and biomechanical data) can yield a modular design to the model that allows new ideas to be included easily, interchanged, and tested computationally. Hence, G&amp;R models can be powerful tools for gaining insight into the complex, evolving processes that govern arterial biomechanics, for evaluating competing hypotheses, and potentially for providing new prognostic information to improve clinical outcomes. For example, our models have suggested that the initial mechanical state of the aorta (e.g., its biological, not chronological, age) prior to the development of an AAA may be particularly important in determining its subsequent progression [<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">47</CitationRef>] and that G&amp;R parameters controlling collagen turnover (e.g., mass production, removal, stiffness, and prestretch) appear to be critical in determining the outcome of the aneurysm (i.e., stabilization, continued expansion, or rupture; [<CitationRef CitationID="CR49">49</CitationRef>]). Nevertheless, much remains to be elucidated about this complex disease process, such as the biochemomechanical role of the intraluminal thrombus within AAAs, contributions to the mechanics due to the presence and later loss of glycosaminoglycans, the roles of different subtypes of collagen, the interactions and cross-linking of the various constituents, and the quantities and distributions of key regulating enzymes. As future G&amp;R models incorporate these added complexities, their usefulness to clinical decision-making will continue to grow.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par21">At this juncture, we recall another line of multiscale biomechanical investigation. Note, for example, that the type I collagen fibers that endow the arterial wall with considerable strength consist of a hierarchical structure. The collagen molecule is approximately 1.5 nm in diameter and 300 nm in length. These molecules are organized into quarter-staggered microfibrils on the order of 4 to 8 nm in diameter. These microfibrils, in turn, are organized into fibrils that may have diameters on the order of 100 to 500 nm, which are brought together to form collagen fibers that may have diameters on the order of 1 to 10 <InlineEquation ID="IEq24">

There have been a number of attempts to develop multiscale models of this type of hierarchical structure. In particular, see Tang et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR42">42</CitationRef>] who propose a model for collagen fibers from nano- to macroscales, the latter of which relates to the aforementioned fiber family models. See, too, Matufi and Gasser [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>] who employ similar methods to study macroscopic behaviors of the aorta. We will return to this line of study below.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par22">Herein, however, it is suggested that we must continue to expand such efforts to develop yet a new class of multiscale constitutive relations for arteries that incorporate contributions not only of the primary structural constituents (e.g., collagen fibers), but also the many accessory proteins, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans that contribute to the microscale and macroscale mechanical properties of individual fibers and hence the tissue as a whole. Indeed, because of the increasing realization that genetic mutations affect directly the macroscopic mechanical behavior of arteries [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>], our mechanical models need to account directly for expected changes in mechanical behavior given specific genetic mutations and related changes to matrix composition. In order to set the stage for such modeling, let us first consider in more detail the three primary structural constituents: elastic fibers, collagen fibers, and proteoglycans.</Para>

Elastic fibers consist of a core of elastin (which constitutes 90 % of a fiber) that is surrounded by so-called microfibrils (mainly fibrillin-1) and microfibril associated glycoproteins (including fibulin-4,5; microfibril associated glycoprotein-1, or MAGP-1; elastin microfibril interface located protein-1, or Emilin-1; and latent transforming growth factor binding proteins, or LTBPs). Fibrillin-1 has a diameter on the order of 10 nm; it appears to be fundamental to elastogenesis and structural integrity, and thus morphogenesis and homeostasis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef>]. It has also been suggested that fibrillin-1 is two orders of magnitude stiffer than elastin, hence it may serve to reinforce the composite fiber [<CitationRef CitationID="CR40">40</CitationRef>]. Fibulin-4,5 belong to the class of “short” fibulins; they appear to be particularly important in elastogenesis for they preferentially bind tropoelastin rather than polymerized elastin [<CitationRef CitationID="CR51">51</CitationRef>]. MAGP-1 are components of the microfibrils that appear to be important in homeostasis, not elastogenesis. Like Emilin-1 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>], MAGP-1 also appears to be involved in the regulation of transforming growth factor—beta (TGF-<InlineEquation ID="IEq25">

            <Para ID="Par24">Amongst the many matrix components, fibrillin-1 appears to play a particularly important role in the the long-term mechanical stability of elastic fibers. In humans, for example, the half-life of normal elastic fibers appears to be on the order of 50 years to 70 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. This long-term stability is fundamental to the mechanical function of these fibers for they tend to be deposited primarily during the perinatal period and, thereafter, must suffer on the order of 30 million cycles of loading per year in humans. Thus, of the many structural constituents, elastic fibers alone are subject to a fatigue-induced damage as well as the normal and pathological proteolytic insults and mechanical overloading experienced by other intramural constituents. Mutations in the fibrillin 1 gene (<Emphasis Type="Italic">FBN1</Emphasis>), which cause Marfan syndrome, lead to aortic root / ascending aortic aneurysms and possible dissections. It appears that part of the pathogenic process is indeed an accelerated fatigue of the elastic fibers, which may appear as an accelerated aging of the wall prior to the extreme dilatation or intramural separation seen in later stages of the disease.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par25">In contrast, it appears that the short fibulins (fibulin-4,5) contribute to the elastogenesis, that is, the initial organization of the elastic fibers during the perinatal period. Mutations in the fibulin 4 and 5 genes (<Emphasis Type="Italic">EFEMP2</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">DANCE</Emphasis>) have also been associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms in humans, though this does not appear to be a common phenotype. In mice, knockout of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Fbln4</Emphasis> results in thoracic aneurysms whereas knockout of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Fbln5</Emphasis> leads to increased aortic stiffening [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>]. The latter appears to manifest early on and not to be progressive [<CitationRef CitationID="CR45">45</CitationRef>]. It is not yet known structurally why mutations that code two very similar glycoproteins result in such different aortic phenotypes. Clearly, there is a need to understand better the mechanical consequences of these genetic mutations.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par26">
              <Emphasis Type="Italic">Collagen Fibers</Emphasis>. There are many members of the family of proteins called collagen, but the members of primary importance in arteries are fibrillar types I, III, and V and network forming type IV (Wagenseil and Mecham 2009). Of these, types I and III are most abundant within the arterial wall: type I constitutes nearly 70 % and type III nearly 30 % of all arterial collagen. Whereas elastic fibers endow arteries primarily with resilience, and thus elastic recoil, fibrillar collagens endow arteries with stiffness and strength.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par27">Collagen I is thought to be the primary collagen endowing the arterial wall with strength; it has a heterotrimeric triple helical structure consisting of two alpha1 (coded by <Emphasis Type="Italic">COL1A1</Emphasis>) and one alpha 2 (coded by <Emphasis Type="Italic">COL1A2</Emphasis>) helices. One mutation to a gene coding collagen I results in a condition known as osteogenesis imperfecta. As implied by this term, one of the main phenotypes is fragile bones. Nevertheless, an osteogenesis imperfecta <Emphasis Type="Italic">Col1a2</Emphasis> null mouse also presents with reduced thoracic aortic integrity, due in part to reduced functional collagen [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>]. Indeed, another mouse model with a <Emphasis Type="Italic">Col1a1</Emphasis> mutation is susceptible to both aortic dissection and rupture [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>]. Collagen III is thought to contribute to the elasticity of the arterial wall; it has a homotrimeric triple helical structure consisting of three alpha1 helices. Mutations to the gene coding collagen III <Emphasis Type="Italic">(COL3A1)</Emphasis> cause vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). This syndrome is characterized by fragile arteries and aneurysms that may arise in many arterial locations. This finding is not unexpected from the perspective that collagen III represents nearly 30 % of the collagen in the normal aorta, much of it found in the media. It has thus long been recognized as an important contributor to the structural integrity of the wall. Not surprisingly, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Col3a1</Emphasis> haploinsufficient mouse also recapitulates the vEDS phenotype [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. In contrast to collagen I and III, collagen V is typically regarded as a “minor” collagen in arteries. It appears to play an important structural role nonetheless, that is, it is important in collagen I fibrillogenesis by helping to organize the fibrils into fibers. Collagen V has a heterotrimeric helical structure consisting of two alpha1 (coded by <Emphasis Type="Italic">COL5A1</Emphasis>) and one alpha2 (coded by <Emphasis Type="Italic">COL5A2</Emphasis>) helices. The Col5a1 haploinsufficient mouse also results in a vEDS phenotype, with decreased aortic stiffness and strength [<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">46</CitationRef>]. In particular, there was a lower density of collagen fibrils in the collagen V deficient arteries, and the existing fibrils exhibited highly irregular cross-sectional shapes. It is interesting to note, therefore, that collagen III and collagen V both contribute to collagen I fibrillogenesis (cf. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>]).</Para>
            <Para ID="Par28">
              <Emphasis Type="Italic">Proteoglycans</Emphasis>. Although typically constituting only 2–5 % of the extracellular matrix in arteries, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans (PGs) play fundamental roles in the structural integrity. PGs consist of a protein core to which are attached multiple GAG chains. The four primary classes of GAGs are hyaluronan, chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and keratan sulfate. Of particular interest herein, are the small lucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs), biglycan, and decorin. Both of these SLRPs aid in collagen fibrillogensis and they bind TGF-<InlineEquation ID="IEq27">

It has been shown [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>], for example, that biglycan deficiency in a BALB/cA mouse line results in spontaneous aortic dissection and rupture despite baseline aortic stiffness being near normal. Of particular note, wall strength was lower, collagen fibers exhibited irregular diameters, and dissection occurred between the media and adventitia not unlike in the collagen III mutant noted earlier.</Para>

              <Emphasis Type="Italic">Further Extracellular Matrix Interactions</Emphasis>. Extensive cross-links and physical entanglements contribute significantly to the overall integrity of the arterial wall. Cross-links are formed primarily via two classes of enzymes, the lysyl oxidases and transglutaminases[<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>], but nonenzymatic glycation cross-links can also become important in both aging and diabetes. Notwithstanding the fundamental importance of intra- and inter-constituent interactions, associated mechanical data remain scant.</Para>

            <Heading>Discussion and Directions</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par30">Historically, we have seen constitutive formulations for arteries transition from inappropriate linear elastic relations to more appropriate nonlinearly elastic, viscoelastic, and poroelastic relations. Moreover, these nonlinear relations have appropriately transitioned from phenomenological to microstructurally motivated, the latter of which include multiscale constituent and growth and remodeling relations. Each class of nonlinear relation has different advantages and we are reminded that constitutive relations do not describe materials; rather, they describe the response of a material to applied loads under conditions of interest, thus different classes of relations can be equally useful depending on the particular question of importance. That said, advances in genetics have revealed that mutations to many genes that code structural constituents within the extracellular matrix can lead to an altered ability of an artery to adapt to changing hemodynamics or to an increased risk of lethal conditions such as aneurysms and dissections. There is, therefore, a pressing need to broaden our constitutive modeling efforts to include multiscale effects of constituent interactions, both at an individual fiber and an integrated matrix level.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par31">We have seen, for example, that G&amp;R models that account for seaparate mechanical properties, natural (stress-free) configurations, and rates of turnover of individual constituents can provide significantly more information, indeed emergent results not possible with traditional relations. There is, however, an opportunity to incorporate within both classical constitutive (stress–strain) relations and contemporary growth and remodeling models increasing multiscale information that accounts for additional proteins, glycoproteins, and glycosaminoglycans that are parts of the primary structural constituents. For example, we must understand better and model structural roles of fibrillin-1, fibulin-4, and fibulin-5 and how they affect the structural integrity, including fatigue resistance, of elastic fibers. As noted earlier, compromised elastic fibers due to deficiencies in any of these three glycoproteins can lead to arterial stiffening, lengthening, dilatation (e.g., aneurysm), or dissections. Similarly, we must understand better and model roles of collagen III, collagen V, and biglycan in collagen I fibrillogenesis. Structurally competent collagen I is essential for maintaining sufficient arterial strength and thereby to prevent rupture [<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">39</CitationRef>]. Because interactions amongst these different biomolecules occur at a nano- to micro-level and yet manifest at a macro-level as clinically important changes in arterial integrity, multiscale models are clearly needed. Without such models, we will not be able to predict maladaptations or disease progression due to particular genetic mutations; we will similarly not be able to design optimal treatment strategies. Indeed, multiscale models will also be needed to quantify microstructural damage and degradation, both of which are important for understanding altered structural integrity and cellular responses. For example, cells respond to “cryptic sites” on molecules that are exposed when the molecule is deformed or disrupted (cf. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>]). Mechanics must play a role in understanding such structurally based cell responses.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par32">In summary, advances in genetics as well as matrix and cell biology have revealed the fundamental importance to arterial integrity and adaptability of what have been previously considered as “minor” extracellular matrix constituents. Given the “major” roles played by these constituents, our constitutive relations must begin to incorporate their status directly, which will require multiscale approaches.</Para>
