There are dominant, colorful individuals who are spiritual leaders of their organizations. Alternatively, there are quiet and thoughtful leaders that delegate responsibility and create energy behind the scenes. And of course the leadership spectrum includes everything in between. Regardless of style, one of the most daunting but ever present challenges for any leader is changing the status quo.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par3" TextBreak="No">Why are we so anxious to remain the same? The responsibilities of a demanding position are many and can be overwhelming; this is particularly true for physicians. These responsibilities can be daunting at first but we then grow through adaptation and become accustomed to our environment. We devise effective ways to tackle daily challenges, stress is relieved and we eventually develop a routine. We are also given resources and become accustomed to these resources whether they be salary, support staff or space. Then someone comes along, perhaps you as the new leader, and the decision is made to change the status quo or diminish resources. The process of adaptation then begins again, new stresses, more work, fewer resources and new challenges. It is not surprising that we all favor the status quo.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par4" TextBreak="No">But change is inevitable. The external environment is constantly evolving and thus organizations need to respond. This is particularly true for health care organizations in our current environment. So the challenge of leadership is to facilitate change in a positive and adaptive manner. There are many ways to accomplish this. The following is an outline of several principles that can aid in facilitating change: <UnorderedList Mark="Bullet">

            <Heading>Create a Vision</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par17" TextBreak="No">It is essential to create and articulate a vision so your organization will understand the reason for change. Although there are notable historical examples where populations have blindly followed leadership usually to the detriment of society, in most sophisticated organizations particularly those that involve physicians, it is absolutely necessary to articulate the reason for change. Change can be particularly difficult if it is not clear where the organization is headed. The vision should be simple, concise, clear, and easy to articulate. Examples might be: <Emphasis Type="Italic">our goal is to move into the top ten in NIH rankings</Emphasis>, or <Emphasis Type="Italic">we plan to grow our clinical volume by 20</Emphasis> % <Emphasis Type="Italic">over the next 3 years</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">or due to a loss of a major insurance contract we plan to reduce expenses by 10</Emphasis> %. There may be dozens of sub-themes that are required to accomplish each of these goals. However, the overall objective should be transparent and clear to all.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par18" TextBreak="No">The vision should be widely dispersed and repeatedly emphasized using a variety of venues. Restating the vision or strategic plan at meetings, in conversation, or through print will lead to a widespread understanding of the overall direction of your organization. To reinforce the vision, there are companies that produce laminated pocket cards with a concise summary of the organization’s goals. For reasonably sophisticated groups this approach may be unnecessary. However, one should at any time be able to stop a member of your organization in the hallway, ask what are the organization’s top three goals, and anticipate the same concise answer from all. Asking an organization to change without providing a clear and logical goal can be a recipe for failure.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par19" TextBreak="No">Although debatable, I believe that most goals, particularly the positive ones, should be aspirational, higher than what you predict can ever be achieved. On the positive side, if you are leading physicians, you are endowed with an organization of overachievers. Moreover, if you plan for a home run there are few that would be disappointed with a stand-up triple. That said your goals should not be unrealistic. If the target is so unachievable that it can never be reached, no one will ever try. It can be frustrating to fall significantly short of your goal, especially in an organization where the constituents are accustomed to success.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par20" TextBreak="No">The vision or goal that you create should be logical and sensible. The loss of an important insurance contract has reduced the organization’s revenue by 10 %, thus the organizational budget must be diminished accordingly. Although this seems a relatively straight forward and persuasive rationale for cutting costs, the devil is in the detail. For example, there is a common belief that under duress, organizations can manufacture money or that there are secret caches that can be called up from reserve. The other common argument made during budget reduction discussions, is that my department because of its importance to the organization should remain budget neutral while other less important departments make cuts. All of these complexities aside, it is widely understood that all organizations need to balance their budget, thus external financial pressures make a sensible argument for internal fiscal reform. Alternatively, it is easier to create vision around positive rather than negative goals. Why would you not want to be top ten in NIH rankings or who would not want to grow their clinical volume? These goals are “mom and apple pie”. In a broad sense it would be almost unpatriotic to argue against these types of goals. Regardless of whether the organization’s goals are positive or negative, they need to be concise, logical and reasonable in order to gain wide spread acceptance.</Para>

            <Heading>Align Your Leadership</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par21" TextBreak="No">With rare exception, every leader reports to an even higher level of leadership. The hospital CEO reports to his or her board and the Dean reports to either a board or the Chancellor. When instituting change, particularly, changes that are controversial, it is essential that leadership be supportive. If your constituents are not satisfied with the changes that you proposed there is almost absolute certainty that your leadership will become aware and even involved. Thus, it is essential that there be upward communication before the change is implemented. Your leadership will feel “blindsided” if the first time they learn about a controversial decision is when they are approached by someone from your organization who is negatively affected. How often you need to preemptively communicate your decisions with leadership can vary. The most relevant factor will be your relationship with these individuals. Is there mutual trust? Will your leadership support you even if they disagree with the decision? Early in your leadership role, more is likely better when it comes to communication.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par22" TextBreak="No">In addition to gaining the support of your leadership it is important to (1) gauge the strength of their support, (2) measure their individual fortitude or ability to withstand controversy and (3) assess the complexity of their and your political environment. For controversial decisions, your leadership must be completely aligned. Moreover, they must have the strength to provide firm support regardless of the level of controversy. Lastly you need to understand the larger political environment. Your leader may or may not, at this specific juncture, have the necessary political capital to help implement your change.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par23" TextBreak="No">It is equally important to gain the support of other key individuals in your organization. This would include individuals who have significant institutional influence or who are directly or peripherally affected by the proposed change. For example, if you are the Chair of Surgery, other leaders that are often affected by your decisions include other Department Chairs, the institution’s Chief Medical Officer, the Board of Trustees, other medical school or university leadership, legislators, etc. Communicating with these individuals, whether it be to provide information or persuasion, will enhance the likelihood of your initiative’s success. For controversial changes, it is absolutely essential that leadership and key constituents be solidly behind you.</Para>

          <Section1 ID="Sec4">
            <Heading>Are You on Board?</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par24" TextBreak="No">Passion is easy to arouse if the vision is yours. But what if you are asked to implement an organizational initiative that you do not support or to which you did not contribute. Or even more challenging is to implement an initiative that negatively impacts the group that you lead. Every leader will be asked from time to time to effect changes they may not support. This is part of the job. There are multiple ways to accomplish the same goal and it may well be that the style or approach of your leadership differs from yours. Alternatively the initiative may negatively impact your group but be beneficial to the organization as a whole. Give and take is necessary in every leadership role; perhaps in the next negotiation the outcome will favor you. Ironically during your tenure as a leader, you will ask <Emphasis Type="Italic">your</Emphasis> team from time to time to implement changes that they do not personally support. In the rare situation where the proposed change is grossly misaligned with your individual goals and principles or will be irreparably harmful to your group, some level of reconciliation with your leadership will be necessary. However, learning how to be accommodating and flexible is an essential part of being a leader.</Para>

            <Heading>Create a “Burning Platform”</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par25" TextBreak="No">One of the major impediments to change is the lack of a perceived need. “It’s all going well so why do we need to do anything differently”. The lack of an imminent and compelling reason for change has been the cause of failure of many great initiatives. When proposing change it is worth considering whether there is a “burning platform”. The concept is that the platform on which you are standing is on fire. It will burn quickly making it imperative that you abandon the platform as soon as possible. To initiate change it is imperative that you make the case that the status quo is changing quickly. We must move rapidly to a new strategy before our organization falls behind. If there is an immediate, palpable and convincing need for change, the burning platform already exists. But often, the need for change is subtle. For example, changes in health care may evolve slowly over time. However, with a slowly changing environment, how does one develop a proactive strategy and prepare for the future? Alternatively what if there is a desire to take an organization that is currently successful to a new and higher level. If the status quo is comfortable, how do you motivate your constituents to greater achievement? The task for leadership is to transform these more subtle reasons for change into a compelling “burning platform”. This requires convincing your constituents of the need to be proactive, to prepare for change; to engender excitement around growing to the next level. The platform may be on fire but the flames are not obvious. Creating “immediacy” around a situation that may take time to evolve is one of the virtues of a strong leader. It is your responsibility to see into the future, prepare for change and convince the organization to proactively adapt. Moreover, change often takes years to effect, producing an immediacy to initiate the process. Creating a burning platform is a strategy that can help convince your organization that change is compelling but also that the time for change is now.</Para>

          <Section1 ID="Sec6">
            <Heading>Be Definitive About Your Commitment to Change</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par26" TextBreak="No">For most new leaders, at some point your resolve will be tested. Are you truly willing or able to enforce change, particularly in the face of conflict? No one wishes to be challenged but if you are instituting change, you will be challenged. Although it is difficult to face adversity at any time during your tenure as a leader, this is particularly true early on. Nevertheless, an early challenge, if unavoidable, can also be a strategic opportunity. An early show of resolve can go a long way in sending a message to your organization about your strength as a leader and your commitment to change. Unfortunately an early show of weakness can have the counter effect. This is not to suggest that one should search for conflict. Peaceful, cooperative, and collaborative change is always the desired goal. But if this is not possible, then a show of strength is far more effective than a demonstration of weakness. There is a belief by some that conflict should be avoided at all cost during the first few months of one’s leadership tenure; that difficult decisions should be made only after time has passed and political capitol has been gained. The alternative view is that your political capital is greatest soon after your arrival and that maintenance of this capitol is achieved by being a consistent, firm and strong advocate of your vision. Regardless of the timing of change, it is critical that your constituents from the outset understand your firm and unwavering devotion to the mission and your absolute expectation that they will join in the cause.</Para>

            <Heading>Passion and Creating an Organizational Culture</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par27" TextBreak="No">Passion is an important asset when attempting to create change. There are many styles of effective leadership and some do not involve passion. However, when trying to create a new culture, a leader’s enthusiasm and engagement can be pivotal. When the change is for the positive (i.e. growth of the organization) conveying excitement and a sense of community can rally the troops. Even if the change is negative or disruptive, a sense of compassion and caring can go a long way in ameliorating the negative impact.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par28" TextBreak="No">Along with passion it is important to articulate the reason for change in a way that resonates with the individuals that are affected. For example the goal is to encourage physicians to arrive at their clinics on time. One approach might be: “You need to be timely in clinic because the medical foundation is focused on cost and efficiency.” Although this statement will resonate with leadership it may be less relevant to the practicing physician. Alternatively the statement: “You need to be in clinic on time because your patients deserve the best and it is unfair to ask them to wait”, might be received by providers with a greater degree of enthusiasm. A strong leader is able to articulate the vision in a manner that provides a clear understanding of why this change is necessary to achieve the core values of the organization. One of the most important attributes of a great leader is the ability to communicate and to connect on a personal level.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par29" TextBreak="No">Many changes benefit the organization as a whole, but not specific individuals within the organization. Although not always immediately obvious, if the organization is successful ultimately its constituents will benefit. There in lies the need to instill in individuals an organizational culture rather than a culture of individuals. This is a difficult concept for many to grasp, particularly successful physicians. We are encouraged during training and early in our careers to devote significant time and energy to our personal success. College, medical school and residency are intense experiences that require a great deal of self-absorption and focus. Alternatively, it becomes challenging when we are asked later in our careers, to leave behind the personal focus and devote time and energy to our organization or institution. One of the greatest challenges for all leaders is build an organizational culture. How do you convince your constituents that organizational synergy can outperform the sum of individual efforts? If the organization is greatly successful and accomplished, each individual’s success will be enhanced. Celebrating organizational success can be as rewarding as celebrating personal success as long as there is camaraderie and a unified mission. We can take great lessons in this regard from college sports. The best of quarterbacks becomes inconspicuous if he/she is part of a losing team, whereas even a mediocre quarterback can be successful if supported by a superb offensive line.</Para>

            <Heading>Lead by Example</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par30" TextBreak="No">If you as the leader provide expectations for those in your organization, it is important to impose these same expectations on yourself. If your physicians are told to arrive in clinic on time, then you should arrive 15 min early. If the goal for researchers is to have a sustainably-funded research program, then if you conduct research, your program should also be funded. Although the adage “do as I say not as I do” may work well for parenting (it probably doesn’t work well for parenting), this approach is particularly ineffective for leaders. If you want your organization to change then you should be at the forefront leading that change.</Para>

            <Heading>Speed and Timing</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par31" TextBreak="No">One of the virtues of a transformational leader is impatience, a lack of comfort with the status quo, an insatiable desire to improve and push the organization to higher levels. Many organizations have benefited from leaders with these characteristics. These traits, however, need to be balanced by a calculated understanding of the organization’s appetite for, and ability to, change. Moving too quickly without building consensus can lead to failure. There are many examples, particularly in health care, of individuals making dramatic organizational changes within the first few months of their arrival, leading to their failure as a leader. This “scorched earth” approach is occasionally, albeit rarely, effective in the world of medicine.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par32" TextBreak="No">However, there are also consequences to moving too slowly. Our external environment has no limit on how quickly it can evolve and health care organizations must keep pace. Opportunities do not remain viable forever. Moreover, even when you think you are moving rapidly the pace is usually not quick enough. Once you have overcome inertia and the momentum is behind you, there is no reason to let inertia take hold again.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par33" TextBreak="No">The pace of change should be individualized, and will vary with the magnitude of the proposed change as well as the culture of the organization. A capable leader will be capable of weighing these factors and determining the correct pace. The middle ground is often best, however a little impatience can keep an organization awake, vibrant and progressive. One strategy is to make changes quickly but phase in over time. This approach can be effective when it comes to compensation. For example, the decision of an organization to reduce salaries by 10 % can be challenging. Most individuals create a lifestyle that consumes the majority of their income, thus even small reductions in salary can be devastating. However, if that reduction can be phased in over 3 years, this provides employees the opportunity to plan and accommodate over time. In sum, it is necessary to balance healthy impatience with a thoughtful calculation of the level of disruption a transformational initiative will produce. The bottom line is don’t wait too long! There is value in being out in front.</Para>

            <Heading>Be Sensitive to Your Constituents</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par34" TextBreak="No">The response to change from the members of your organization will vary dramatically. The utopia for any leader is that the entire organization will be enthusiastic and supportive of the proposed change. However, unanimous support for any change is unusual if not remote. Nonetheless, the more the better when it comes to supporters. One needs strong allies to carry a vision forward.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par35" TextBreak="No">After those that support your vision, there will be a second cohort of individuals who are ambivalent, not passionate about your vision but not opposed. This group deserves a great deal of, focus and attention, as it is these individuals that you are most likely to sway.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par36" TextBreak="No">Then there will be those that oppose your initiative. There is an obvious need to invest time and effort in this group. The first step is to learn the reasoning behind their opposition. Is it possible that that they are right and you are wrong? Be open-minded. Step out of the box and put yourself into their roles. What about their personal situation makes the resistance so forceful? Are there work-arounds that can simultaneously achieve everyone’s goals? Is there the ability to negotiate a win-win situation for these individuals and your organization? Understanding the opposition is important in that it produces insights that can allow you to reframe your vision or initiative in a way that is more sensible or palatable for individuals who are less comfortable with the change. Under some circumstances a compromise or a more gradual rate of change might be best rather than failure of the initiative or multiple casualties. When negotiating with individuals that oppose change, it is critical to not personalize your interactions. Resistance and the anger that can ensue is most often directed to the proposed change, not to you as an individual. One of the most important lessons for all leaders to learn the concept of “it’s just business”. Those in leadership must be capable of separating their individual emotions from the strife that change can bring to an organization.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par37" TextBreak="No">Those that oppose change will fall into three groups: passive, passive/aggressive, or aggressive resistors. Each of these individuals poses a different set of challenges. The passive group may eventually come along although the effort involved in moving these individuals forward can be substantial. Passive/aggressive individuals will not be visibly opposed to change but will work behind the scenes to interfere. This can be a frustrating group and the most difficult to address since opposition is not overt. Aggressive individuals will be outspoken and actively campaign against the change. The degree of opposition can vary from moderate to fierce. However, direct opposition is often easier to address because the issues are tangible, visible and open.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par38" TextBreak="No">When addressing those that resist change, the approach needs to be individualized, calm, thoughtful, and most importantly respectful. Today’s health care systems are evolving rapidly. Changes rarely benefit everyone. It is unusual that strategic decisions are either “right” or “wrong”. It is important to have empathy. Consider the following example: A long-standing faculty member has been allowed for years to assume a moderate clinical load and perform unfunded research. As the health care environment changes, resources diminish and now this same individual needs to assume a full clinical load or obtain funding for their research. Little surprise that that this change would lead to resistance and unhappiness on the part of the faculty. The current behavior has been tolerated, if not condoned for years. For this individual, although the need for change is obvious, resistance would be anticipated. It is important, to be understanding if not empathetic to this individual’s situation. A long-standing agreement is being changed. A significant investment of time, accompanied by sensitivity, a thorough explanation, as well as persuasion, can be rewarding and help in such transitions.</Para>

            <Heading>A Strategy for Non-adopters</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par39" TextBreak="No">The question is how to respond when, despite your best efforts, resistance persists. What does one do when the decision is absolute, the organization will move on, but resistance continues? There are several possible strategies. First, exceptions can be made however this approach is usually problematic. The danger is that those who you have cajoled into change, particularly individuals who were initially reluctant, will not understand why others have been excused. If exceptions are made, it is important that these individuals not be outspoken. This is a strategy that should be undertaken with care; there should be a solid rationale for making exceptions.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par40" TextBreak="No">If exceptions are not made, the change is substantial, and leadership stands firm, those that resist will ultimately need to consider whether or not to leave the organization. Most reasonable individuals that cannot accept change will realize their tenure in the organization is not durable. It is rare that non-adopters, particularly those with a reasonable degree of sophistication, remain in an environment where they do not fit. Most of us strive to be comfortable and secure at work and we seek an environment where this is readily achievable. Thus, rarely is there the need for termination. Nevertheless, when it appears that termination may be necessary, a preemptive conversation, suggesting the value of searching for other opportunities, can avoid the disruption and negativity that accompanies termination. Nevertheless, there are times where termination is the only alternative. When this must happen, the reasons should be clear and concise. The need for change as well as the expectations must have been repeatedly articulated and appropriate warnings provided.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par41" TextBreak="No">For all non-adopters, there may be a period of discussion or negotiation. During these negotiations, the leader must be thoughtful, calm, and strategic. It is critical to not play in the sandbox. Interactions need to be supportive with constant reinforcement of the positive aspects of change. E-mail interactions, particularly those that are negative, are forbidden. Recognition of each individual’s viewpoints is essential. Great leaders are positive and sensitive but also unflappable and firm. The downfall of many bright and talented leaders has been (1) their adversity to conflict or (2) their inability to effectively manage conflict.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par42" TextBreak="No">In promoting change it is critically important to remain focused on the positive; on the goals and the vision rather than the resistance. Both need tending. However, the split should be 80 % positive and 20 % negative. If more time and energy are devoted to the resistance, less time is available for forward movement. Many great initiatives have not been successfully completed because a small group or even an individual resistor has been capable of consuming the leader’s full attention and energy. When under fire and in the face of significant opposition, it is sometimes difficult to focus on the positive, to embrace one’s supporters, and feel confident about the mission. Ultimately success requires continued forward movement.</Para>

The vision was to be in the top ten within the next 5 years and in our first year we have moved into top 20. We have successfully reduced our expenses by 10 % yet we were able to care for more patients with higher quality. For those who have made sacrifices or have contributed time and energy to the initiative, learning of the organization’s success can be greatly rewarding. Moreover, a personal compliment at a critical juncture can be worth more than a raise or a bonus. Be certain to celebrate your success at every possible juncture.</Para>

We know from Darwin that evolution sacrifices some. But humans, particularly sophisticated physicians, have an impressive ability to adapt and evolve. It is surprising how resistant individuals can be to change …maybe not that surprising. But equally impressive is how capable we are of responding particularly if the environment is positive and supportive. There are some that readily embrace change, however, many do not.

There are many leadership strategies that can be employed to manage organizational change.

For adaptive change, the onus is on the leadership to demonstrate that the new culture will be beneficial to all.</Para>
