          <Para ID="Par1">This chapter describes the general look and feel of the StrokeBack system. It concentrates on real-world requirements and previous experiences in telemedicine work and provides the blue print for the StrokeBack system development. The implementation and integration of the overall project solution into a “Smart Table” and “Mobile Station” of MEYTEC is described. In the follow-up aspects related to exploitation of the project results, commercialization and business potential are discussed. It provides the details of the associated market, the profiles of the tentative clients and the opportunities for further post-project exploitation. The same is done for by-products of the project. In addition the reader is provided with details related to regulatory framework regarding medical devices and software and the assessment of the consortium regarding a characterization of exploitable outcomes from this framework.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par2">The goal of system development in telemedicine is the user/patient benefit. Corresponding to the software architecture guidelines defined in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>], the user benefit is described in Use Cases (UC). The content of these UC is determined by the project description and experiences in former projects concerning medical tele-rehabilitation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. Differences in healthcare systems of partner countries have been considered to design the most suitable system for the StrokeBack project [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. The following sections describe five UC that have been identified to complete the StrokeBack system from user perspective. The list of applicable use cases follows.</Para>

              <Heading>Clinical Assessment of Patient’s Needs (UC 1)</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par3">The physician/therapist explores the individual impairments and needs of the physically present patient. She/he agrees with the patient about its expected benefit and outcome of the rehabilitation. The doctor’s advice and filling of clinical scores, i.e., Barthel Index (BI) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>] and the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QoL), are complemented by execution of test tasks as a subset of the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). This execution of test tasks is tracked by a couple of sensors capable of motion capturing and EMG measurement (if necessary from clinical point of view). Scores of the WMFT are filled manually by the physician/therapist and are determined by the sensing system in parallel.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par4">The patient executes training sessions at home using the StrokeBack system with and without supervision by the therapist. Supervision may additionally be provided in real time by bidirectional audio-visual communication or by exchange of written messages. Patient may select the exercise to do from an offered set of exercises. The difficulty may be adjusted by the patient in a given range or set by the therapist.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par5">Patient’s daily live activities are tracked by a Body Area Network (BAN) worn throughout the day. All data are logged and transferred in certain periods to the home base station where data are processed to determine daily activity statistics. Thereafter, these statistics are stored in patient’s Personal Health Record (PHR). The patient needs a BAN and a comfortable way to attach it for daily use.</Para>

To control the patient’s exercises in home environment, it needs multimedia output channels as speaker for audio signals and a screen for video signals. Both channels are used to give the patient three different stimuli: (a) a number of pointers how to execute correctly the exercise, (b) the information about the exercise and its options and (c) experience of motivation by playful tasks. The PHS gets multimodal feedback from the patient as the speech, the body gesture and the hand movements handling the training objects and while executing the exercises. Speech and body gesture are captured by the component itself while further inputs are given by the components IAB, ECT, and BAN. The PHS contains the following subsystems: a computer, front screen, microphone and speaker, controllable camera (with pan and tilt), and the network interface.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par50">The patient sits in the chair (or wheelchair) at the work table trolley. Chair and trolley can be adapted to the needs of the individual patient. His/her body posture should be optimal for monitoring by sensors and/or camera. The table trolley must be equipped with immobilization brakes and the option to adjust the table height, preferably during installation phase. Adjustment to table height can be done using dowels steps. Table design must prevent it from falling. Its size should fit to the free place in a regular living room. As a first approach, the size of 800 × 1000 mm is fixed. The depth of 800 mm is needed for positioning of vertical computer screen. The width of 1000 mm is needed for positioning of the near-field motion tracker.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par51">The motion tracking of hands and training objects must be available to (1) support exercises, (2) to evaluate movements during exercises and (3) to provide a comfortable Human—Machine Interface (HMI) for the patient. The design of comfortable HMI for the patient considers his/her impairments controlling the “Patient’s training place” by movements. Such functionality is provided by the unit “Motion Tracker” represented in the first approach by the commercial product “Kinect,” used in near-field mode, and the “Kinect-Server.”</Para>
              <Para ID="Par52">The “Kinect-Server” subsystem reduces the data stream sent by the commercial product “Kinect” to few essential messages and skeleton ankle positions. The output of the unit “Motion Tracker” is formatted specifically, so that a transmission to the component “Patient’s Home Station” is feasible. It is intended proposing a communication standard between training devices and the PHS in the framework of homely rehabilitation equipment. The mentioned concept considers optionally developing further kinds of interaction boards or training devices in the future, which then may communicate via that interface with the PHS as well.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par53">Patients interact with the “Patient’s Home Station” via three different user interfaces: a video screen, a graphical display of the “Interaction Board” and audio (microphone and speakers). The main video screen displays information regarding a choice of exercises, the configuration of exercises such as level of difficulty, the type of sounds, and other adjustments preparing the exercise. During live communication, the face of therapist or physician may be displayed on the main screen. The live communication can be combined with exercises motivating the patient and suggestions by therapist in parallel. Both tasks of remote care are essentially to keep the motivation of the patient high and to avoid wrong movement learning.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par54">During training, the state of exercises and scores are displayed. Content of exercises and the graphical representation of tasks can also be displayed on the interaction board. Graphical information must not be presented on both channels in parallel to avoid too complex tasks and irritation while concentrating on both screens. At the end, the kind of exercise practically identifies where the main content is displayed: Exercises for hand rehabilitation and tasks with real training objects will be displayed on the interaction board. Exercises with virtual reality involving whole upper body parts will display their content on the main screen. The speaker outputs the speech in live communication with the advisor and the sound of exercises, i.e., music or spoken commands.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par57">However, such approach requires more or less equal time of therapists as in real visit. Overcoming such drawback, the component “Exercise and Compensation Tool” is added. This unit automatically evaluates current movements and exercises to signal changes or failures to improve patient performance similar to real trainings with therapists. This feedback is based on capturing motion of the entire upper part of the body. The unit contains “Far-Field Kinect” and “Expert System” units. The latter one generates feedback for the patient based on motion capture and transmits feedback messages from the component “ECT” to the “Patient’s Home Station” unit, where these are put out via speakers.</Para>

<Emphasis Type="Bold">Version A</Emphasis>: The “Interactions Board” consists of a glass plate as half transparent back projection screen, a mini projector with controller and the unit “Motion Tracker.” The visual content is received by the unit “WLAN” and sent to the mini projector via the video controller. The projection is executed from below against the glass plate serving as work area for the patient. The training objects are located on the glass plate where the exercise is executed. The unit “Motion Tracker” is located above the glass plate on the right or left side and must not hinder the exercises of the patient. The unit “Motion Tracker” creates a volume model of the hand and the training objects and identifies collisions between the hands and objects as well as the glass plate. The collisions are messaged as touch-events to the component “Patient’s Home Station.” Currently the functionalities of the “Motion Tracker” are offered by the modified commercial “Kinect-Server.”</Para>

          <Para ID="Par135">The StrokeBack system addressed two primary types of users i.e., patients and therapists or care persons respectively. It is quite obvious that both user types must not be confronted with any technical duties and tasks. Therefore the system had to be self-explanatory and self-calibrating up to certain level, e.g., a fixed training place should be able to recalibrate or reconfigure autonomously with minimal intervention of the users.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par136">From the patient’s point of view, the usability of hardware components of the StrokeBack system, especially when used at home without on-site therapists, is the most crucial point to be sorted out. Currently, the most challenging tasks will be: How to enable ease of use when sensors need to be attached to the body by the patient herself? How to determine, or make sure respectively, that the sensors will be at the right positions? Different ideas have been discussed already. For example, a wrist band such as used for wristwatches should be a proper means to attach sensors to the wrist of the arm under monitoring. However, means that aren’t easy to handle for the patient, or that need assistance from a care person, are to be avoided wherever applicable. Here, the consortium will rely on hands-on knowledge gathered in previous projects. Necessary approaches were agreed as soon as first technical experiments allowed a detailed analysis of a technical architecture and components used. A close work with therapists in early experimental phases allowed to determine proper and smooth ways of integrating devices in patients’ daily routines.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par137">Furthermore, designs of user interfaces regarding the look and feel of the system and the graphical representation have been discussed. Currently, the system provides a touch screen display with a simple GUI for patients composed of large, color-coded icons. The four sections are represented to patients with big buttons:<UnorderedList Mark="Bullet">

<Emphasis Type="Bold">Exercises</Emphasis>/<Emphasis Type="Bold">Training</Emphasis>—The patient should use this section to initiate and select training sessions and exercises. It will feature a graphical representation of the rehabilitation plan that is to be configured by the therapist. It will most probably allow configuring training sessions on daily basis with an integrated calendar function. This enables to integrate reminder messages and audio-visual reminder functions as well.</Para>

          <Para ID="Par142">In general, any data given to the patient should be high-level data with minimal details and should preferably be presented in graphical and/or audio-visual way. Similarly, data accessible by the therapist should also be simple data but on a more detailed basis. Therapists will have access to timesheets, training results, and rehabilitation progress in more detail, e.g., being able to figure out number and quality of single exercises. However, end users will neither gain access to raw sensor data nor to interim values or algorithms. The main design rule is: Keep it simple!</Para>
          <Para ID="Par143">The technical design guidelines based on experiences from previous projects, various system approaches, and use cases have been reviewed and assessed for drafting the StrokeBack architecture.</Para>

            <Heading>Evaluation of the Overall Design</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par144">The first drafts of the architecture and requirements, allowed for use cases and lists of components required for each use case to be selected. Furthermore, aspects of look and feel of the StrokeBack system and its integration into patient’s home and life have been incorporated into the design. As a result of further investigations regarding minimum distances between patient and the Kinect cameras, a prototype of the patient home station has been produced. This has been used as initial reference system for parallel developments of all subsystems.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par145">Several instances of serious games have been tested and improved according to the feedback from therapists and patients. The same holds true for development of the PHR interfaces, the Exercise and Compensation Analyse (ECA) tool from UP and the user interface of the patient station. With respect to the events specified for controlling the rehab games, the event capturing algorithms has been developed using a near-field Kinect focussing on wrist movements and palm opening/closing as these have been identified by the physicians as key objectives for successful rehabilitation of the post-stroke patient (refer to Chap. <ExternalRef>
                <RefSource>7</RefSource>

            <Para ID="Par146">While integrating both main Kinect-based subsystems ECA tool and wrist movement capturing, the performance of the near-field Kinect system decreases significantly when both Kinects are used in parallel. Hence, we need to merge both implementations to work with one Kinect only if possible. Therefore the patient home station will integrate one Kinect device only.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par147">Finally, the empirical evaluation of the assembled Patient Station and its respective workflow commenced with the design of the patient station with a vertical and a horizontal screen.

            <Para ID="Par148">Since the first prototype of the mobile patient station was quite large and heavy, thus a second much smaller variant has been designed. Photos of both variants are shown in Figs. <InternalRef RefID="Fig16">9.16</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Fig17">9.17</InternalRef>, respectively. The first prototype is based on the design of the stationary device in the clinic, while the second one adds few technical improvements. In particular, near-field Kinect was removed with a leap motion sensor taking over monitoring/recognition of hand movements. This allowed to get rid of the second computer inside the horizontal part of the device lying on the desk. In total, the size of the mobile station has been reduced by 30–40 % and the weight reduced by 50 % as well. Please note that the sizes of the displays used in both variants are equal, as this might not be distinguishable in the figures.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig16">

            <Para ID="Par149">The functionality of exercise monitoring tool has enabled the monitoring of the whole upper body of a person instead of single limbs only. Instead of calculating position of body joints and angles between adjacent body parts, the evaluation tool can calculate complete 3D vectors of each body part including length and direction of those. This enables a much more precise modelling of the upper body. A tool for real-time supervision of simple, non-complex exercises is already available. It allows to record and monitor individual but simple exercises. This tool has been re-implemented for usage on window platforms, which has been chosen as the basic programming environment for the StrokeBack system. It has been further extended to support parallel multi-exercise monitoring of previously recorded exercises.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par150">In addition to the modelling and evaluation of correct execution of therapeutic exercises, a tool to detect unwanted or not-allowed movements during training sessions, called compensational movements, is developed. This is especially desirable from the therapeutical point of view. In a real-life training session, normally the therapist pays attention to unintentional movements and corrects those, e.g., leaning forward or movement of the shoulder. In StrokeBack, the monitoring systems should do this automatically. Hence, we investigated a library of compensational movements that need to be monitored during normal execution of exercises. Therefore we have worked out an overview of compensational movements that commonly appear during training with stroke affected patients. A first version of this tool that detects compensational shoulder movements. In the very end, both tools would be merged into one tool, called Exercise and Compensation Analyse.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par151">Advanced training means based on the interaction board and near-field use of the Kinect camera have been discussed. It deals with fine-granular tracking of hand movements and gesture recognition for a single hand. In particular, to clench a fist, to open and close the hand as well as extension/flexion of the wrist should be observed. This setting will be investigated as an extended rehabilitation tool. Please note, none of the currently available Service Development Kits (SDKs) for the Kinect camera allows for fine-grained tracking of hand movements or finger tracking in general. Such a tool is currently still under development. The wrist movement monitoring tool based on near-field use of the Kinect for Xbox is ready for use. A respective application using the Kinect for Windows device and the standard SDK is under development.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par152">To keep the motivation of the patient high while exercising, the exercises are to be combined with small games. A respective list of several potential games has been described in Chap. <ExternalRef>

                <RefTarget Address="10.1007/978-3-319-21293-7_5" TargetType="DOI"/>
              </ExternalRef>. All games have been iteratively reviewed by the medical partners in view of usability for stroke patient and potential therapeutic impact of expected control means (movements/exercises to control the game) in correlation to rehabilitation outcome. The gaming engine will be loosely coupled to different exercises, which means the controlling movements can be individually set to the patient’s therapeutic needs. Prototypes of four games are ready to be tested. After testing and selection by the therapists, we focus future implementations on the following games (refer to Chap. <ExternalRef>

            <Para ID="Par157">The evaluation of the StrokeBack system allowed to ensure high acceptance of the results by end users. In order to achieve this we follow an iterative approach. In very early stages we use the Tandem stack available at IHP or the FeuerWehr sensor node developed at IHP to do experiments for evaluating the feasibility of approaches under consideration in other work packages. Here we think of evaluating technical parameters such as processing speed accuracy. In addition we involved experts in the field (sub-contractors, e.g., physical therapists with working experience in stationary and ambulant rehabilitation) and patients to get early feedback on the acceptance, e.g., of graphical look and feel of applications under development. Later on when the final system is ready we aim to do experiments with the fully integrated system together with sub-contractor and patients. Early designed workstation is located at therapists and at patients living room to enable project partners to perform real live tests.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par158">The project partners have agreed on a common procedure and time schedule for development and closely coupled early tests of game ideas and exercises in parallel. BBK has led and assisted in the technical development, thanks to their medical and therapeutic knowledge. The key issue here is to balance the technical feasibilities and medical requirements to develop a reasonable system for individual needs of people suffering from stroke. During the project lifetime, the StrokeBack team investigated the following components:<UnorderedList Mark="Bullet">

            <Para ID="Par163">A description of the WMFT test procedures, descriptions, and manuals of assessment principles and scores as well as complete exercise evaluation sheets are available. These have already been used for the patient trials in March 2013. An initial sensor set-up of Shimmer sensing devices have further been used in regular tests with patients at BBK. This setting was technically supported by IHP and SOTON. The reason behind this is the fact that a patient usually stays in the rehabilitation clinic at BBK for 3–4 weeks only. To gather realistic sensor data for development and refinement of movement detection algorithms, BBK has integrated several test movements into the regular therapy schedule, i.e., same patients have carried out the same exercises on weekly basis. Thereby we have collected reliable data about feasibility and accuracy of developed algorithms and more important, we have investigated whether a progress in rehabilitation could be measured with technical means. To compare technical outcome to clinical assessment means, therapists have made a record of the protocol rehabilitation progress in parallel.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par164">According to the feedback from medical partners, the patient station and the sensor system only could be accepted for trials if both parts provided the minimum safety CE marks. Therefore MEYTEC as the partner responsible for overall system integration, investigated all CE requirements for the patient station and IHP for the BAN. As the BAN is a wireless radio system, it had to be further proofed to meet the maximum safety value of electromagnetic tolerance. For IHP as a research partner this meant to have the sensor system tested by a certified sub-contractor.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par165">The wrist detection engine has been improved to deliver more accurate and reliable gesture recognition. In addition, it is now more robust against influences from the compensation detection tool using the second (far-field) Kinect. The wrist detection tools can now be more accurately configured to the patients sitting position at the table and provides better detection results even if the patient does not exactly adhere to the training position. The latter one might be the most difficult problem at the very end, especially for patients with severely limited mobility of the upper limbs or the hand respectively. For better usability, several improvements have been made such as manuals and instruction videos for the games and the other exercises.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par166">The EET tool has been improved and tested in several instances for application of more fine-grained configuration means. Also a GUI for more visual feedback is now available. The new features are running properly, but however require to have detailed knowledge about its behavior and influence of several different parameters that can be set for configuration. Indeed, detailed configuration for various patients and upper limbs movement recognition can be configured. Hence the EET tool demonstrated its functionality, but might not be useful in common practice due to configuration process that is too complex for therapists or non-technical personnel.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par167">The ADL-detection engine using the BAN is available as stand-alone unit for live detection of ADL activities. The application has been improved so that the sensor worn at the wrist is automatically activated and collects data autonomously during the day. For demonstration purposes a GUI has been implemented displaying gathered data and detection results. Likewise the sensor-equipped cube is available for therapy means. It automatically connects to the patient station and sends orientation data during training. Respective software with a GUI has been implemented.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par168">The most severe problems have arisen due to instability and size of the mobile prototype as well as unsynchronised communication between the patient station and the PHR. The interplay between the different components of all partners has been changed many times. Hence the integration of the software components and especially exchange of training plans, configurations and training results between the patient station and the PHR is prone to failures.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par174">There are many different customer paths that StrokeBack could attempt to go to market with, but one market that clearly is important is that of at-home rehabilitation care (tele-rehabilitation). With this said, and although at-home market incorporates the end user, it is important to understand that, before attempting to penetrate that market, the clinical segment should be the initial market to be targeted. For this market, some relevant details are provided in following paragraphs.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par175">In the USA, according to Hoovers’ market report on Rehabilitation Therapy Services [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>], the rehabilitation therapy industry consists of about 30,000 establishments with combined annual revenue of approximately $20 billion. The industry is highly fragmented, with the top 50 companies accounting for less than 25 % of total revenue. More specifically, the outpatient rehabilitation industry accounts for nearly $5 billion of Medicare spending. This figure has been rising steadily, and has more than doubled since 2000 when annual rehabilitation expenditures were $2.1 billion. The three primary classifications within outpatient rehabilitation are: physical therapy, i.e., diagnosis and treatment of physical impairments, functional limitations, disabilities, or changes in physical function and health status; occupational therapy, i.e., treatment to improve or restore functions that have been impaired (or permanently lost or reduced) because of illness or injury, to improve the individual’s ability to perform tasks required for independent functioning; and speech language pathology—diagnosis and treatment of speech and language disorders that result in communication disabilities or problems with swallowing. Of the three outpatient rehabilitation classifications, physical therapy expenditures far outweigh spending in the other areas, accounting for nearly three quarters of all outpatient rehabilitation spending (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig20">9.20</InternalRef>).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig20">

F&amp;S has found that the European RPM market earned revenues of US $175 million in 2007 and estimates this to reach $400 million by 2014. More specifically, RPM in Europe in 2009 was dominated by UK with 25 % market share and Germany with 21 %. Other prominent markets include France, Italy, and Benelux.

In many European countries, the government plays an important role in procuring, launching, supporting, and distributing the tele-rehabilitation service, while taking care about the regulatory aspects of the service deployment and operation. Health insurance companies are also engaged in the associated health service cost payments. The motivation for their intervention is that eHealth and mHealth services can contribute in healthcare cost reduction due to more cost-efficient medical treatments.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par182">The service providers’ group includes several key actors: the patients, the therapists, and clinicians (i.e., the healthcare professionals), and the non-professional caretakers (e.g., family members). The patients make use of the system (the Rehab Table) at their residential environment. The non-professional caretakers may help patients during the process of using the Rehab Table. At the clinical environment, the healthcare professionals (clinicians and therapists) make use of the system (the Therapist Station) to set up care plans, monitor the execution of the exercises by the patients and overview the measurements/results. Periodically, the healthcare professionals participate in video communication sessions with their patients.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par183">On the backstage, another group of key actors performs: it includes the equipment manufacturers/integrators who develop and maintain specific system functionalities that support the health service; wholesale and retailers who distribute the product; IT service providers who deploy and maintain the infrastructure; a network provider who offers its broadband network for transport of data between the Rehab Table, the Therapist Station and the central repository, the PHR database.</Para>

<Emphasis Type="Bold">Technological enhancements</Emphasis> [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]: Tele-rehabilitation via teleconferencing technology affords access to many. However, often, using this type of technology requires skilful hand dexterity to manoeuvre using the mouse or the arrow keys on the keyboard. With the development of motion control for video games, users with impaired hand dexterity now have access to much that computers can offer. Furthermore, this motion-controlled interface serves as a therapeutic intervention to improve upper extremity function. In the past, motion tracking and gesture recognition systems such as Polhemus [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>], which has more capabilities yet is extremely expensive, were the only choice for motion tracking and thus cost prohibitive for everyday home use. Recently innovators such as SoftKinetic [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>] now offer natural interfaces for videogames and serious games and allow the users to interact with the digital world in a more immersive, transparent and intuitive manner. With this type of technology, moving objects can be captured in depth dimension and in real time. Using this type of technology removes the need for precise finger dexterity required of typical mouse or game controllers with many buttons to push. On parallel, the developments in the teleconferencing arena (e.g., is voice over internet protocol) offer a very inexpensive alternative to telephone calls and provides tele-rehabilitation with audio feedback. In other words, the therapist located at a remote location can communicate with the client using voice rather than having to type via text or call on a typical landline. The development of videoconferencing embedded within game-based tele-rehabilitation offers real-time feedback between therapist and client, thus ensuring proper movement.</Para>

The stroke patients are exposed to a bigger psychic load than the “healthy” user group, because of their obvious restrictions of motion. They can feel frustration or shame, just because they are not capable to do general daily routine activities because of their illness. This is the reason why the introduction of a new telemedicine-based method into the treating process of post-stroke therapy is such an important question. As previous studies have already proved, using VR-based environment and modern technical devices for the rehabilitation of post-stroke patients, can be an expense-effective solution besides the conventional therapies. After training for 2–3 h a day for 8 days, all of the patients showed increased control of hand and arm during reaching. They all had better stability of the damaged limb, and greater smoothness and efficiency of movement. Kinematic analysis showed that they also had improved control over their fingers and were quicker at all test tasks. In contrast their uninjured arm and the arms of control game players’ group, who had normal hand/arm function, showed no significant improvement at all.</Para>

One can consult Gebruers et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>] for a more exhaustive review. Commonly, these fitness systems provide a summary of the subjects’ physical activity based on activity classification deduced from features extracted from accelerometer signals. However, these systems often support only a limited set of activities (e.g., walking and running) and are not precise in their calculation of energy expenditure. Moreover, they often lack feedback and motivational elements regarding the user’s activity, which nonetheless helps to preserve or increase motivation. Fitness games provide these motivational elements. Current video games include feedback provided by motion sensors, either on the body or based on external cameras, in order for users to follow some fitness exercises, but only few parameters are taken into account and the proposed methods are not documented and not adapted for medical purposes.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par242">In addition, the GHOST platform is used to construct sensor-equipped objects for enhanced rehabilitation therapy means. The first agreed object is a cube with sensing stuff inside, which can determine its position and forward it in real-time to a host for application as a game controller. We may further develop respective interactive games dedicated for applying the cube for hand movement training. All equipped objects are of further interest for exploitation.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par243">To facilitate these applications, each sensor node will be equipped with a microcontroller, a Bluetooth low energy transceiver with integrated antenna, flash memory, power management circuits, and a couple of sensors, amongst others a 3-axis accelerometer and a gyroscope. It furthers provides a pin-header for extension with other modules. The sensor node board is flat and small (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig21">9.21</InternalRef>). Every sensor node can be seen as a single product, but may also be exploited as bundle with or without debugging tools and software. For application in StrokeBack, the sensor nodes are packaged into a case of glass fiber without any ports.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig21">

              <Para ID="Par244">Since IHP and SOTON are research partners and not industry, the focus is on providing a platform for sensor network research with particular focus on wearable BAN applications. The goal is to provide a complete wearable sensing solution for monitoring of body movements with inertial sensors, just as for example provided by the Shimmer platform (<ExternalRef>
                  <RefSource>www.shimmersensing.com</RefSource>
                  <RefTarget Address="http://www.shimmersensing.com" TargetType="URL"/>
                </ExternalRef>). Nevertheless, the GHOST sensor platform can of course also be used for any other sensor network application, e.g., structural health or environmental monitoring. It can be easily extended with additional modules, for example with other radios and sensors.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par245">Such sensor systems are used by both research teams and industry, which approximately require millions of devices per year in Europe only, given the fact that sensor nodes are relatively cheap and will rather be substituted by newer developments than re-used for other purposes (also thanks to new developments). Due to rapidly increasing network coverage—some EU member states can already claim a network coverage of nearly 100 %—applications for ubiquitous remote monitoring are widely used today. We expect the wireless sensor market to grow rapidly for personal health and wellness (including sports) monitoring, as it can be seen for years, e.g., with sensor-equipped clothes and shoes.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par246">With the final GHOSTv2 variant we target another future market, i.e., sensor network applications for critical infrastructure monitoring and homeland security applications, where highly secure sensor hardware and applications are required. The special security features provided by the IHP-crypto-microcontroller on the node should assure a prime position in that market area.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par255">While the GHOSTv1 platform is in a good competitive position compared to existing platforms, the GHOSTv2 variant will offer distinctive security and processing features that are (to the best of our knowledge) not available on the market in a compact sensor platform. Further good arguments for the GHOST platform are envisioned prices and free access to software and tools. Competitive single devices cost about 250€ (Shimmer3 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>]) up to 2000€ (XSENS MTw [<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>]) while complete development kits for developers cost about 2500€ (Shimmer3) up to 13,000€ (XSENS).

              <Para ID="Par256">With the GHOST platform we intend to reach market prices of around 200–300€ for single devices for the hardware, depending on respective sensor node configurations. Instead of selling kits and licenses, we will provide an open source basic driver library for developers which can be used together with freely available tools. This should make the platform very interesting for research and early stage developers. Following this strategy, there is no need to provide respective development bundles, since each customer can just configure its own “kit” by merely selecting the number of respective single sensor nodes that are needed.

            <Heading>Serious Games</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par262">Serious games were designed for the purpose of solving a problem. Although serious games can be entertaining, their main purpose is to investigate, or advertise. Sometimes a game will deliberately sacrifice fun and entertainment in order to achieve a desired progress by the player. Whereas video game genres are classified by gameplay, serious games are not a game genre but a category of games with different purposes. The categories of serious games that are closely related to StrokeBack are those intended for training, also known as “game-learning.”</Para>
            <Para ID="Par263">Serious Games are computer and video games that are intended to not only entertain users, but have additional purposes such as education, rehabilitation, and training. Serious Games can be of any genre and many of them can be considered a kind of edutainment, but the main goal of a serious game is not to entertain, though the potential of games to engage is often an important aspect of the choice to use games as a support tool. A serious game is a simulation which has the look and feel of a game, but is actually a simulation of real-world events or processes. The main goal of a serious game is to train or educate users, though it may have other purposes, such as marketing or advertising, while offering an enjoyable experience.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par264">In the context of the StrokeBack project we refer to the use of games for Health, such as games for psychological therapy, cognitive training, emotional training or physical rehabilitation uses, in our case post-stroke rehabilitation. Almost 80 % of patients do not regain full recovery of arm and hand function and this really limits their independence and ability to return to work. Technology and mental health issues can use Serious Games to make therapy accessible to adolescents who would otherwise not find a psychotherapist approachable.</Para>
            <Section3 ID="Sec59">
              <Heading>Market Details</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par265">Serious gaming has found already way into stroke rehabilitation area. For example neuroscientists at Newcastle University are developing a series of motion-controlled video games to make stroke rehabilitation more fun and accessible. The team’s first title, dubbed Circus Challenge, lets patients digitally throw pies, tame lions, and juggle to help them build strength and regain motor skills. As players progress the game ratchets up its difficulty to match pace with their recovery. With video games people get engrossed in the competition and action of the circus characters and forget that the purpose of the game is therapy. Patients use wireless controllers to learn various circus-related skills, from lion taming and juggling to high diving and trapeze work. As they succeed at various tasks, they go on to more challenging quests that involve greater skill, strength, and coordination.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par266">Games have been designed so that players at different skill levels can still compete. Perhaps most importantly, because of support from the Health Innovation Challenge Fund, the game includes tele-monitoring so that a therapist can watch a patient’s progress remotely and help tailor his or her next steps. It is also geared to those in wheelchairs too or with limited mobility, making the game convenient as well as fun could be key to recovery. Although Limbs Alive, the game’s publisher, has only described their motion controller as “next-generation,” it affirms that the game will be playable on PCs, laptops, and tablets later this year. In an effort to lower costs and provide at-home therapy, the team hopes to leverage a £1.5 million award from the UK’s Health Innovation Challenge Fund to build a system that will allow therapists to monitor patient progress remotely.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par267">The idea behind rehabilitation training is the so-called “mirror box” as a strategy towards functional recovery in stroke survivors. For example, in a 2003 study reported in “Archives of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation,” a mirror box was used along with imagined movement with chronic stage stroke survivors to provide a means to provide good examples of movement for the brain to practice movement by the impaired limb. The 4-week protocol included simulated practice on a variety of simple and complex action sequences. Even though participants were in the chronic stage (more than 1-year post-stroke) and the intervention involved no physical practice, gains in actual performance of the impaired limb were seen following the simulation practice.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par268">In a 2009, researchers at University of Queensland in Australia reported that experience with the Wii Fit resulted in an immediate effect on balance and strength. In 2010, St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto is completing a clinical trial assessing the improvement in performance of stroke survivors. Patients assigned to the Wii group will receive an intensive program consisting of eight 60-min Wii gaming sessions over a 14-day period. There are also a few case studies that have reported on the value of using the virtual world of Wii to improve motor performance. For example, a study published in “Physical Therapy” in 2008 reported on an adolescent with cerebral palsy who participated in training sessions using Wii sports games including boxing, tennis, bowling, and golf. Improvements in visual-perceptual processing, postural control, and functional mobility were measured after the training and positive outcomes were found at the impairment and functional levels. While mirror reflection can fool the brain into thinking a limb is present and working fine, the Wii fools the brain into thinking the person is operating within a completely different environment.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par269">The most technological brain games for stroke rehabilitation use robots. Several groups of researchers are developing robotic devices and protocols for their use. Many of the devices are specific to arm movement. In a 2008 study reported in the journal “Brain,” chronic stage stroke survivors received 3 weeks of therapy with a hand-wrist robot that would provide reaching assistance when it was needed. For example, the robot might move a hand more quickly or accurately to a moving target. Following this training there were two important effects. First, participants who received robotic assistance in all sessions (as opposed to just half of them) showed the greatest functional gains. Second, brain scanning with MRI revealed increased sensorimotor cortex activation across the period of therapy demonstrating that work with the robot-induced brain changes. One downside to the use of robots is that access is relatively limited. Typically, use is restricted to persons participating in research in a rehabilitation lab or receiving treatment at a clinic housed within a medical research environment.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par270">Games have the ability to engage and challenge people of all ages, they have the ability to help individuals manage chronic illnesses, support physical rehabilitation and contribute to changes in health behaviors. Doctors, nurses, rehabilitation specialists, and other health professionals are also using games and game technologies to advance their skills and enhance how they deliver care and services. The acceptance of games as a valuable health management and training method and popular success of consoles such as Wii and Kinect as well as the growth of smartphone game applications indicate that there is a big potential for continuing to move health and behavior change activities beyond the traditional clinical settings and into the consumers’ home, work, and social settings.</Para>

This will expand on the current internal work in the direction of using custom image projection onto the objects and determination of their 3D shapes from distorted images captured by 2D cameras. This will be combined with the development of 3D visual scanning technologies along with wearable microembedded wireless multi-sensor nodes for application in future 3D Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) interfaces. This will be marketed as an OEM technology for future 3D-enabled devices and as IP for ongoing development and deployment of innovative application in the follow-up funded R&amp;D projects.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par280">In principle, Health Service Providers execute the medical care routines and if necessary, they supply to their patients the technical infrastructure (devices, access to software applications, etc.). This infrastructure is provided to the Health Service Providers by an ICT Vendor. Health Service Providers invoice their effort in the form of agreed prices to the Health Insurance companies. Typically, there is an agreement between the Health Insurance companies and all concerned Health Service Providers about the maximum costs of the offered rehabilitation service. ICT vendors serve as the supplier for the assisting technologies (e.g., the Rehab Table, the Therapist Station) and regular providers of associated IT services (e.g., software maintenance and updates, hardware maintenance). So, in general they act as ICT Service providers who sign a contract with the Health Insurance Companies, to offer the above-mentioned infrastructure and service offering to the Health Service Providers and the Insured Patients who are eligible for these specific rehabilitation-related clinical service. In some cases the ICT Service Providers also sign a contract with a broadband network provider (wired and/or wireless), so as to make use of their network infrastructure in the provision of the ICT service. In addition, they have license agreements with the owners of the intellectual property of constituting blocks of the total ICT solution. Such a reimbursement model for the provision of clinical services like the StrokeBack platform is presented in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig22">9.22</InternalRef>.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig22">

            <Para ID="Par281">In Europe, before a medical device is put on the market, the device is required to be affixed with a CE mark, which is an indicator of the product’s compliance with EU legislation. Medical software was considered intangible and functioned as integral parts of medical devices, when the first draft of European Directives was created in the early 1990s [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>]. It was not until 2007, in the preamble of Directives 2007/47/EC4 (European Parliament and the Council, 2007) that European legislators viewed certain types of software, which are “intended for one or more medical purposes set out in the definition for medical devices,” as medical devices. Accordingly, regulatory requirements for these categories of medical software have been changed. These changes are reflected in the Active Implantable Medical Device Directives (AIMD) and the Medical Device Directives (MDD) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>]. The latter is further detailed in the subsequent paragraph. In a nutshell, stand-alone software and accessory software of medical devices are considered medical devices, if they are intended to satisfy the purposes explicitly defined in AIMD and MDD. As with physical devices, this type of software must be CE marked and subject to their own respective conformance assessment. Software that is not related to the core functions of a medical device, but as a component or integral part of the medical device, is not considered a medical device by the EU legislator. This type of software does not require a CE mark.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par282">In the USA, the <Emphasis Type="BoldItalic">Food and Drug Administration</Emphasis> (FDA) is responsible for regulation on software related to medical devices. For premarket approval, the FDA combines product-oriented and process-oriented approaches [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>] to assess the software production quality, where FDA emphasizes on a well-documented and robust quality assurance practice to ensure a “rational” software development process. The most important document used in the FDA’s premarket approval review of medical software is “Reviewer Guidance for Computer-Controlled Medical Devices” (RGCCMD). The guidance defines what data are required for computer-controlled device submission and the three “levels of concerns” to categorize computer-controlled devices. With regards to the post-market surveillance, the FDA oversees marketed computer-controlled devices through Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Along with the assurance of device component acceptability and labelling, GMP requires manufacturers to establish QA programs, documentation for their activities products, updates, and revisions. In terms of regulations, the GMP is compatible with the international standards ISO 9001, which is adopted by the European Committee for specification of quality system requirements of medical devices.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par283">The regulatory bodies in both EU and the USA take into account the development process in addition to the pure product-related aspects in the assessment of the medical software. The CE mark certification process requires a manufacturer of medical devices to attest conformity with all relevant New Approach Directives (NAD). However, it is important to recognize that a CE mark by itself, does not indicate conformity to a particular standard, it only indicates conformity to the legal requirements of E.U. Directives. For most of the medical software, CE marking Directives require ISO 9000 standards, common for system quality assessment.</Para>

            <Heading>European Guidelines on the Qualification and Classification of Stand-Alone Software Used in Healthcare Within the Regulatory Framework of Medical Devices</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par284">Here we summarize the most relevant to StrokeBack extracts of the guidance document issued by European Commission, DG Health And Consumer Directorate B, Unit B2 “Health Technology and Cosmetics” on the issue of Qualification and Classification of stand-alone software [<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>]. The guidelines presented in that document are part of a set of guidelines relating to questions of application of the EU legislation on medical devices. They are legally not binding. The guidelines have been drafted through a process of consultation of the various interested parties (Competent Authorities, Commission services, industry and Notified Bodies in the medical device sector) during which intermediate drafts were circulated and comments were taken up in the document where appropriate. Therefore this document reflects positions taken in particular by the aforementioned interested parties. Due to the participation of the aforementioned interested parties, it is anticipated that these guidelines would follow within the Member States and, therefore, ensure uniform application of relevant Directive provisions.</Para>

              <Heading>Qualification Criteria as Medical Device</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par285">Software can be used for a large variety of medical purposes. In that respect the arguments do not differ from those used for other medical devices. Stand-alone software can directly control an apparatus (e.g., radiotherapy treatment), can provide immediate decision triggering information (e.g., blood glucose meters), or can provide support for healthcare professionals (e.g., ECG interpretation). Not all stand-alone software used within healthcare can be qualified as a medical device. Stand-alone software may run on different operating systems or in virtual environments. These operating systems or virtual environments do not impact the qualification criteria. Stand-alone software might also be an accessory of a medical device. The risk related to a malfunction of the stand-alone software used within healthcare is in itself not a criterion for its qualification or not as a medical device. It is therefore necessary to clarify some criteria for the qualification of stand-alone software as medical devices. The decision diagram (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig23">9.23</InternalRef>) gives some guidance regarding the necessary steps to qualify stand-alone software as medical device.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig23">

Altering the representation of data for embellishment purposes does not make the software a medical device. In other cases, including where the software alters the representation of data for a medical purpose, it could be a medical device. “Simple search” refers to the retrieval of records by matching record metadata against record search criteria, e.g., library functions. Simple search does not include software which provides interpretative search results, e.g., to identify medical findings in health records or on medical images. Software which is intended to create or modify medical information might be qualified as a medical device. If such alterations are made to facilitate the perceptual and/or interpretative tasks performed by the healthcare professionals when reviewing medical information, (e.g., when searching the image for findings that support a clinical hypothesis as to the diagnosis or evolution of therapy) the software could be a medical device.</Para>

Computer programs used in healthcare mostly have applications, which consist of both medical device and non-medical device modules. The modules which are subject to the MDD must comply with the requirements of the MDD and must carry the CE marking. The non-medical device modules are not subject to the requirements of medical devices. It is the obligation of the manufacturer to identify the boundaries and the interfaces of the different modules. The boundaries of the modules which are subject to the MDD should be clearly identified by the manufacturer and based on the intended use. If the modules which are subject to the MDD are intended for use in combination with other modules of the whole software structure, other devices or equipment, the whole combination, including the connection system, must be safe and must not impair the specified performances of modules, which are subject to MDD.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par329">The exploitable outcomes of the project are in the form of a total product concerning the execution of tele-rehabilitation so-called “StrokeBack system.” There are few by-products and/or constituting components that are considered as individual intellectual property (IP), such as the PHR and Care Management platform, the BAN, a number of single exercises/serious games, the Patient-Station, the Therapist-Station. In that sense the consortium anticipates two types of exploitation license agreements. The first is the IP license agreement that is related to the license for integrating certain pieces of hardware/software in the project core product StrokeBack, and the second is the product license agreement, which is related to the license for marketing and selling the product in specific (most probably geographic areas related) markets.</Para>
