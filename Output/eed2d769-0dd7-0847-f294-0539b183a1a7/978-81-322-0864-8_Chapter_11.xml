          <Para TextBreak="No">Biotoxins are generally referred to as toxic substances that are produced naturally and can originate either in fauna or flora. They are of animal or plant origin and produce adverse effects in humans and other animals. They enter the body by ingestion through food or water or by direct exposure in air through aerosols or by bites and stings. The degree and magnitude of biological response depends on the nature of risk factors and relative susceptibility/resistance of the host. Many toxins are biomagnified through the food chain and ultimately humans may suffer. Toxins are produced by organisms, either for defence or offence, and are sometimes used to paralyse the prey. Several biotoxins have been used as medicines as they are the most reactive molecules and in very low concentrations can react with specific target sites. Due to their specificity, some of them have been used as pharmacological tools to study the physiology of the body. Toxins produced by marine organisms are most potent and often reach the human population through food chain. The biotoxins produced by microorganisms like bacteria and fungi can also be very potent and may lead to several health hazards including allergy and mortality. In human health they cause hypotension, bradycardia, negative inotrophic effect on the heart and vasoconstriction of the skin and skeletal muscles. A lectin has been isolated which is cytotoxic and is used as anticancer agent. They also decrease bronchial and salivary secretions in low dose. Some of the important toxins discussed are, namely, okadaic acid, domoic acid, ciguatoxin, scombrotoxin, kainic acid and ibotenic acid.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Biotoxins can be of animal or plant origin or from microorganisms. Toxicity is the function of dose and susceptibility of the host. There is always a safe limit for any toxin, and similarly every known substance can produce a toxic effect beyond a certain point. A biotoxin is a chemical produced by any living organism either for defence or offence and can effect and kill other living organisms. Poisonous animals are found in all groups including birds, that is, from <Emphasis Type="Italic">Alexandrium</Emphasis> to chordates including duckbilled platypus and short-tailed shrew. There are about 1,200 species of poisonous marine animals and 400 species of poisonous snakes. Creatures who have developed secretory glands or groups of cells for producing poison and deliver it during a bite or stinging act are called venomous, and those without specialised mechanisms but whose tissues are toxic are termed poisonous. There are two types of biotoxins: one is of animal origin and the other is of marine origin.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Chemically, toxins are proteins of high or low molecular weight including polypeptides and enzymes (Russell <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">1996</CitationRef>). They can also be amines, lipids, steroids, amino-polysaccharides, quinines, 5-hydroxytryptamine and glycosides. Generally, many of the venoms have high affinity for a particular tissue, causing more damage to that tissue. The toxic activity is named after the specific tissue that the venom targets, for example, neurotoxins, cardiotoxins, hemotoxins and mycotoxins, even though other tissues are affected with higher doses. The more important types of toxins produced by different organisms are described below:</Para>

          <Heading>Toxins of Marine Origin</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Marine toxins are some of the strongest toxins known (Van Dolah <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2010</CitationRef>). Chemically, they contain proteins of low and high molecular weight, lipids, amines, alkaloids, guanidine bases and mucopolysaccharides. In general marine fauna and flora can be toxic, and they cause several epidemics in the coastal areas. Some marine animals particularly fish, mussels and clams may not be themselves poisonous, but the toxins get biomagnified through the food chain as they may feed on toxic dinoflagellates, other diatoms and algae and become toxic to humans even though they themselves do not suffer. Marine mammals may be exposed to environmental stressors such as chemical pollutants, harmful algal biotoxins and emerging or resurging pathogens. Since many marine mammal species share the coastal environment with humans and consume the same food, they also may serve as effective sentinels for public health problems. Marine mammals are sentimental species for oceans and human health (Bossart <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2011</CitationRef>). Finally, marine mammals are charismatic megafauna that typically stimulate an exaggerated human behavioural response and are thus more likely to be observed. Seafood is high on the list of food transmitting disease. However, the food safety issues are highly focussed, and more than 80% of all seafood-borne outbreaks are related to biotoxins (ciguatoxin), scombrotoxin or the consumption of raw molluscan shellfish. It is pointed out that there are serious safety concerns related to the consumption of raw fish and shellfish due to the presence of biological (bacteria, virus, parasites) and chemical (biotoxins) hazards. These hazards are present in the fish and shellfish preharvest and are difficult or impossible to control by applying presently available preventive measures. In contrast, the hazards related to contamination, recontamination or survival of biological hazards during processing are well defined and can be controlled by applying good manufacturing practice (GMP), good hygiene practice (GHP) and a well-designed HACCP programme. Similarly, to prevent the growth of pathogenic microorganisms during distribution and storage of the final products are—with a few exceptions—available. Proper application of well-known preservative parameters including temperature is able to control growth of most pathogens. When this is not always the case, for example, inhibition of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Listeria monocytogenes</Emphasis> in lightly preserved fish products, it is recommended to limit the stated shelf life of these products to a period of no growth for the pathogen of concern. There is good agreement between the trends shown in disease statistics, the hazard analysis and the qualitative risk assessment of the various fish products. It is recommended that consumers should be informed of the risk of eating raw seafood—particularly molluscan shellfish and certain freshwater fish.</Para>

When ingested, they cause hypotension, bradycardia and muscular twitchings. They act on the sodium current in the heart resulting in the depolarisation of the membrane. Aconitine alkaloid from <Emphasis Type="Italic">Aconitum napellus</Emphasis> causes cardiac arrhythmia and repeated firing of nerves due to action on Na channels. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Taxus baccata</Emphasis> leaf intake has been reported to cause death due to cardiac or respiratory failure as it inhibits Ca<Superscript>++</Superscript> current in the heart. Taxol derived from <Emphasis Type="Italic">T. brevifolia</Emphasis> has anticancer properties.

Isolation of phoratoxin has been reported. It is a polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 13,000 and causes hypotension, bradycardia, negative inotrophic effect on the heart and vasoconstriction of skin and skeletal muscles. Another parasitic plant is <Emphasis Type="Italic">Viscum album</Emphasis> from which polypeptides viscotoxins have been isolated. They are five times more toxic than phoratoxins. A lectin viscumin has been isolated which is cytotoxic and used as anticancer agents. Among the fungi, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Claviceps purpurea</Emphasis>, a parasite of rye grain yields ergot. It is well known to cause vasoconstriction of the extremities leading to gangrene and also has a stimulant action on uterus.

            <Heading>Okadaic Acid (OKA)</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Produced by dinoflagellates and can cause toxicity at concentrations of 0.5–1.0 nM. It is a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A leading to significant increase in protein phosphorylation and alters the activity of Ca<Superscript>++</Superscript>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-K). It is tumour promoter and cellular functions such as smooth muscle contraction, fatty acid biosynthesis, protein synthesis, catecholamines and their secretions. Liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to search for esters of DSP toxins in Portuguese bivalves. Hexane-soluble derivatives of okadaic acid (OA) and dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2) were found. Presumably, they are acyl derivatives, globally known as ‘dinophysistoxin-3’ (DTX-3). In certain instances DTX-3 content surpassed 50% of the total amount of DSP toxins. A human diarrhoeic poisoning (DSP) incident with Donax clams (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Donax trunculus</Emphasis>) harvested at Fuzeta (Algarve coast) was confirmed where the apolar (DTX-3 type) and other esters remaining in the polar aqueous methanol layer were implicated. The percentage of acyl esters of OA was always higher than those of DTX-2. An enzymic mechanism for the conversion of OA and DTX-2 seems to be implicated in some kind of detoxification process because the percentage of esters increases with the toxin amount ingested by the bivalve, and there is some degree of selectivity as DTX-2 seems more difficult to acylate (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">11.1</InternalRef>). These findings pose a problem for the current assay methods used to detect DSP because mainly they are able to detect the parent toxins but not their esters. The current bioassay method used in Portugal includes a hexane washing step that prevents interference from free fatty acids. However, it cannot detect the presence of acyl derivatives because they are highly soluble in hexane (Vale et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">1999</CitationRef>).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

              <Emphasis Type="Italic">Domoic acid</Emphasis> (DA), the neurotoxin that causes amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), is a kainic acid analogue, heterocyclic amino acid associated with certain harmful algal blooms.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In 1958, domoic acid was originally isolated from the red alga called ‘doumoi’ or ‘hanayanagi’ (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Chondria armata</Emphasis>) in Japan. ‘Doumoi’ is used as an anthelmintic in Tokunoshima, Kagoshima. Domoic acid is also produced by some diatoms of the genus <Emphasis Type="Italic">Pseudo-nitzschia</Emphasis> and by some strains of the diatom species <Emphasis Type="Italic">Nitzschia navis-varingica</Emphasis>. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries</Emphasis> loses most of its ability to produce domoic acid when it is cultured axenically. However, domoic acid production recovers when bacteria from the original culture are reintroduced to axenic cultures, indicating a bacterial association with domoic acid production in this species. The increasing frequency and geographic extent of toxic algal blooms along populated coastlines is generally attributed to human activities. Considerable recent research has been carried out by the Marine Mammal Center and other scientific centres on the association of domoic acid-producing harmful algal blooms and neurological damage in marine mammals of the Pacific Ocean. Domoic acid can bioaccumulate in marine organisms such as shellfish, anchovies and sardines that feed on the phytoplankton known to produce this toxin. It can accumulate in high concentrations in the tissues of these plankton feeders when the toxic phytoplankton itself is high in concentration in the surrounding waters.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In mammals, including humans, domoic acid acts as a neurotoxin, causing short-term memory loss, brain damage and, in severe cases, death. DA-producing algal blooms are associated with the phenomenon of amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP). In marine mammals, domoic acid typically causes seizures and tremors. In the brain, domoic acid especially damages the hippocampus and amygdaloid nucleus. It damages the neurons by activating AMPA and kainate receptors, causing an influx of calcium. Although calcium flowing into cells is a normal event, the uncontrolled increase of calcium causes the cell to degenerate. Because the hippocampus may be severely damaged, short-term memory loss occurs. It is a rare excitatory tricarboxylic amino acid. It is activated by dicarboxylic acid, aspartic acid and glutamic acid and is mainly neurotoxic in behaviour (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">11.2</InternalRef>).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig2">

There are also reports that scombrotoxin could occur in salmon species. Generally, fast-swimming and migratory finfish species with red-coloured meat are more likely to develop high histamine levels than whitefish species. The toxin is not limited to fresh and frozen fish. It may be present in canned and cured fish products at high enough concentrations to cause illness. The concentration of histamine can vary considerably between different sampling sites in a single fish or between individual cans in a single lot. Levels of &gt;3,000 ppm have been recorded in fish products implicated in outbreaks.

                <Para TextBreak="No">Scombrotoxic (histamine) poisoning is a chemical intoxication, in which symptoms typically develop rapidly (from 10 min to 2 h) after ingestion of food containing toxic histamine levels. The range of symptoms experienced is quite wide, but may include an oral burning or tingling sensation, skin rash and localised inflammation, hypotension, headaches and flushing. In some cases vomiting and diarrhoea may develop, and elderly or sick individuals may require hospital treatment. The symptoms usually resolve themselves within 24 h. The evidence for histamine as the active toxin in scombrotoxic poisoning is strong, but the condition is very difficult to replicate in humans using pure histamine. It is possible that other biogenic amines in spoiled fish, such as putrescine and cadaverine, may act as potentiators for histamine toxicity, but the mechanism for this is not known.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">For this reason the threshold toxic level for histamine remains uncertain. Individuals also vary in the severity of their response to histamine in fish. Analysis of outbreaks suggests that levels of histamine above 200 ppm are potentially toxic. Although histamine occurs naturally in the human body, exposure to large doses can rapidly produce the symptoms of toxicity.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">The symptoms of histamine poisoning resemble an allergic reaction, and there is potential for misdiagnosis. Furthermore, since symptoms are usually mild, it is likely that the illness is considerably under-reported. Nevertheless, it is thought that histamine poisoning is probably the commonest form of fish-related toxicity. The highest numbers of cases are reported in the USA, Japan and the UK, but this may be a reflection of reporting systems rather than incidence. Between 1992 and 2004, England and Wales reported 56 outbreaks affecting 296 people. Outbreaks were more common in summer than in winter. In the USA, between 1968 and 1980, 103 outbreaks involving 827 people were reported and in Japan over the same period, 42 outbreaks affecting 4,122 people. Large outbreaks also occur. In 1973, at least 200 US consumers became ill after eating domestic canned tuna. In the first 6 months of 2005, an unusual increase in incidence was reported in England and Wales, with 16 outbreaks affecting 38 people. This was thought to be associated with poor temperature control and hygiene in certain catering premises.</Para>

                <Heading>Sources</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Histamine in fish and other foods is produced by the decarboxylation of the amino acid histidine, and fish species that have high levels of free histidine in their tissues are most likely to develop toxic histamine levels. This is usually the result of the action of the enzyme histidine decarboxylase, which is found in a number of bacterial species that may occur on fish. Species such as <Emphasis Type="Italic">Vibrio</Emphasis> spp., <Emphasis Type="Italic">Pseudomonas</Emphasis> spp. and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Photobacterium</Emphasis> spp. are found in the marine environment and occur naturally on fish. Others, especially the Enterobacteriaceae, are contaminants that are introduced after postharvest. It is this second group that is considered most important in the development of histamine. Species such as <Emphasis Type="Italic">Morganella morganii</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Hafnia alvei</Emphasis> are able to produce high levels of histamine very rapidly at mesophilic temperatures (20–30°C). For this reason, histamine is more often produced during spoilage in this temperature range, although high levels can also develop at lower temperatures over time.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In tropical waters the indigenous microflora may be more important histamine-producing organisms, particularly when fishing methods such as longlining are used, where the fish may die before landing. Under these conditions, it is possible for histamine to be formed before the fish is landed and chilled. There is evidence that histidine decarboxylase remains active at chill temperatures, even though the bacteria themselves are not active. Therefore, once the enzyme has been formed at higher temperatures, it may continue to produce histamine even when the fish is properly chilled. It is also possible for histamine to form after cooking or canning if the fish subsequently becomes contaminated with histidine decarboxylase-producing bacteria. This can happen when canned fish is handled under conditions of poor hygiene.</Para>

It can survive canning and retorting processes and is not reduced during freezing or frozen storage. Furthermore, high histamine levels may not be accompanied by other signs of spoilage and may be undetectable other than by chemical analysis. The enzyme histidine decarboxylase is inactivated by cooking, and further histamine will not then be produced unless recontamination occurs.</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">The key measure for the control of histamine production in fish is rapid chilling as soon as possible after death, particularly where the fish has been exposed to warm water. This will inhibit the formation of bacterial histidine decarboxylase. Once the enzyme is present, control options are very limited. Accepted guidelines (FAO/FDA) recommend that fish should be placed in ice or chilled seawater or brine at &lt;4.4°C within 12 h of death or placed in chilled seawater or brine at &lt;10°C within 9 h of death. If the fish have been exposed to air or water temperatures above 28.3°C, they should be chilled to &lt;4.4°C within 6 h, and very large fish such as tuna that are eviscerated before chilling also should have the body cavity packed with ice.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Further chilling to a temperature as close to the freezing point as possible is desirable to prevent less rapid formation of histidine decarboxylase at lower temperatures. Even rapid chilling to &lt;4.4°C may only give a safe shelf life of 5–7 days. Once frozen, the fish can be stored safely for extended periods, and further histidine decarboxylase will not be formed. However, enzyme produced before freezing will not be destroyed and will continue to produce histamine after thawing.</Para>

For example, puncture wounds in fish can introduce contaminating bacteria into deep tissue where large concentrations of histidine are available. Histamine production may then happen much more quickly. Good hygiene at processing and preparation stages further along the supply chain, such as cutting and packing or in catering operations, is also important to prevent contamination of fresh fish or recontamination of frozen and cooked fish.</Para>

Chemical testing can provide some assurance that toxic levels of histamine are not present, but the variability in histamine levels in a single fish means that very large numbers of samples must be taken. For this reason, chemical testing cannot be relied upon to demonstrate adequate control of the hazard, but can be useful as an HACCP verification tool.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">European legislation states that fish species belonging to families known to contain large amounts of histidine (e.g. Scombridae, Clupeidae) in their tissues should be tested for the presence of histamine. Nine samples should be tested from each lot, and the mean value should be ≤100 ppm. The lot is considered unsatisfactory if more than two samples give results between 100 and 200 ppm or if any sample gives a result of ≥200 ppm. A mean level of 200 ppm and a maximum limit of 400 ppm are permitted for fish that have undergone enzyme maturation in brine. In USA the Food and Drug Administration has issued guidelines for tuna and related fish establishing a ‘defect action level’ of 50 ppm in any sample. This is said to be indicative of spoilage and may mean that toxic levels are present in other samples. A separate toxicity level of 500 ppm is also given. The international Codex standard for fish also includes histamine levels as indicators of decomposition and hygiene and handling. A maximum average level of not more than 100 ppm is considered satisfactory in relation to decomposition, while an upper limit of 200 ppm in any one sample is applied for hygiene and handling.</Para>

Kainic acid is a potent central nervous system stimulant and has been developed as the prototype neuroexcitatory amino acid for the induction of seizures in experimental animals, at a typical dose of 10–30 mg/kg in mice. Kainic acid is neuroexcitotoxic and epileptogenic, acting through specific kainate receptors. Because of the supply shortage in 2000, the price of kainic acid has risen significantly.<OrderedList>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Biotoxins are produced by a wide range of organisms for defence or offence, or to catch prey, and they include animals and plants including microorganisms like bacteria and fungi. They can enter the body through ingestion of food and water or by air through aerosols. Marine biotoxins are important since they are most potent, and many of them get biomagnified and become part of food chain. Some toxins are used as drugs and/or pharmacological tools because of their specificity. The reaction of the body to a toxin depends upon many factors ranging from nutritional status to genetic make-up and dose of the toxin taken.</Para>
