              <Para>During the last decade, the efforts in the field of atmospheric modeling have been directed towards a joint ‘online’ approach of the meteorological and chemical processes in order to treat, in an integrated way, their complex and interactive links. This approach allows for the use of all meteorological fields as input in the chemical submodel, at each model time step, as well as takes into consideration the concentration of the pollutants on the meteorological processes (radiation and cloud microphysics). In this work, the air pollution over East Mediterranean is assessed with the use of the fully coupled, two-way interactive modeling system ICLAMS. Simulations have been performed for several test cases enhancing on the feedback mechanisms that occur. The summer case (July 2005) is used as base evaluation case due the increased insolation and high photolytic activity. The ozone model results are compared with measurements from stations from the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP). The correlation coefficient over all model domain reaches 0.7 with a root mean square error 22.78 μg/m<Superscript>3</Superscript> and mean bias 0.74 μg/m<Superscript>3</Superscript>. The spring case (April 2004) highlights on the impact of mineral dust and sea salt on the photolysis rates that in turn determine the concentration of ozone in the area. The presence of dust over Finokalia station (Crete, Greece) leads to a decrease in the photolysis rates of NO2 and O3. Another winter case has also been discussed regarding the role of anthropogenic aerosols on clouds and precipitation.</Para>

              <Para>The assessment of weather processes and atmospheric chemistry in a combined way is a necessity in chemical weather modeling. Traditional chemical transport modeling systems use an offline approach that has several drawbacks. Chemical weather forecasting is based on online integrated modeling systems since this approach gives the possibility to consider the links between air pollution and meteorological processes. These links consist of several feedback mechanisms of direct, semi-direct and non-direct type on radiation, clouds and precipitation. The thermally induced circulation is responsible for the distribution of the gases and aerosols, and therefore any changes, from the direct effects, in the temperature and wind field, will lead to changes in their concentrations. Additionally the indirect effect plays a crucial role in the pollutants levels through removal processes.</Para>
              <Para>Another important link between chemistry and meteorology refers to the strong dependency of the photolysis rates on the actinic fluxes that in an integrated model can be achieved through the online calculation of them, therefore giving the possibility to reflect any changes on the actinic fluxes due to the changes on the cloud cover. The present work focuses on the feedbacks between air pollution and meteorology over East Mediterranean in an attempt to define certain conditions when the impact of these links is magnified. The integrated fully coupled model ICLAMS is used for this study. A detailed description of the development related to the natural aerosols and several meteorological schemes is given in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00471">1</CitationRef>]. The chemical component of the model constitutes of the gas (SAPRC99) and aqueous chemistry module (RADM) and the gas-particle interaction module (ISORROPIA). The photochemical scheme uses basic formulations and it is directly coupled with the radiation scheme.</Para>

                <Para>The performance of the integrated model for a summer test case, characterized by enhanced radiation and low cloud cover (increased photolytic activity), is discussed for four sub-regions: West Europe (WE 12 stations), Central Europe (CE 38 stations), Iberian Peninsula (IP 10 stations) and East Europe (EE 7 stations) to reflect different characteristics and measurements availability. The comparison of the modelled and observed ozone concentrations reveals a satisfactory performance overall domain with single station correlations above 0.6, apart from several distinct areas of lower correlation (lower than 0.4) along Austrian Alps, and coastal areas due to coarse resolution. Low correlations are also noted over Greece and Cyprus but the RMSE in these cases is low (less than 20 μg/m<Superscript>3</Superscript>) indicating the lack of diurnal ozone cycle in these areas that are mostly affected by long range transport. Overall domain, the absolute mean biases are also low. Several discrete statistical parameters are summarized in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00471">47.1</InternalRef> for each sub-region. In all sub-regions the R coefficient is above 0.7 and absolute mean biases less than 6 μg/m<Superscript>3</Superscript>. RMSE varies from 20.86 to 23.69 μg/m<Superscript>3</Superscript>. The standard deviations of the model and observed averages differ by approx. 10 μg/m<Superscript>3</Superscript> indicating a lower diurnal span of modeled hourly ozone concentrations. The spatial resolution of the model (24 km) is adequate for a satisfactory description of the chemical and meteorological mechanisms that take place but may be low for areas with complex terrain and high altitudes therefore nesting configuration must be applied for local air quality studies. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00471">

                <Heading>Impact of Aerosols on Clouds and Precipitation: 26–30 January 2003</Heading>
                <Para>Solomos et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00471">1</CitationRef>] studied the case of 26–30 January 2003 when a low pressure system and a dust storm coexisted over East Mediterranean, showing that prognostic natural aerosol treatment gave better results than simulations with prescribed aerosol properties. In this study anthropogenic aerosols are explicitly represented and their impact on precipitation is discussed. In order to assess the respective effect of sulphate aerosols on precipitation two runs were performed with a solely difference the inclusion of the sulphates activation as CCN (Run with dust and salt – RD; Run with dust, salt and sulphate aerosols – RS). Over East Mediterranean there are two spots of increased sulphate activity that may result in considerable levels of sulphate aerosols over the coastline of Israel: Cairo mega city and west coast of Israel (power plants). The RS cloud system exhibits lower cloud top, enhancement of ice formation and suppression of cloud development over sea (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00473">47.3</InternalRef>a, b). Over the entire domain the 24 h accumulated precipitation remains the same in both cases but the spatiotemporal features of hourly precipitation differ (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00473">47.3</InternalRef>c). The maximum values of the hourly precipitation in the RD case are noticed more inland that in the RS case. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00473">

                <Heading>Impact of Aviation Emissions on Ozone Levels Over Europe and GMR</Heading>
                <Para>The inclusion of aviation emissions in the emission inventory leads to an increase in the ozone levels over Europe and GMR. The higher differences are noticed over Mediterranean due to the prevailing westerly flow over continental Europe and the etesian winds over the Aegean Sea that transfers the pollutants from East Europe over Eastern Mediterranean and Northeast Africa (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00474">47.4</InternalRef>). <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00474">

              <Para>The online approach for chemical weather modelling systems gives the opportunity to capture features that cannot be accurately described by the conventional meteorological and air quality models. Apart from configuration advantages, the integrated model can assess links and feedbacks between atmospheric processes. The order of magnitude of these interactions is a necessary quantification for local applications to climatological studies.</Para>

              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: The AQ impacts of O3 (∼10–20 ppb) due to aviation emissions seem too high. Can you report these as a recent of total anthropogenic O3 over your domain? A similar analysis of NOx emissions budgets (aircraft as a percent of total anthropogenic NOx) will be helpful.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: What was shown is O3 difference in the lower troposphere (runs with minus without aviation emissions of all type). The numbers mentioned in the presentation as too high are spotted at specific locations and are instant values, not averaged as in the paper. As an average, aviation emissions contribute to a relatively small percentage but for specific locations and seasons it can become more important (e.g. near or downwind from a major airport). This analysis is not finished yet and therefore is hard to quantify at this stage.</SimplePara>
