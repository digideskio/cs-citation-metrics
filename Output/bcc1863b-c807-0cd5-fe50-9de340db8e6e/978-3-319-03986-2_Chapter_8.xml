          <Para TextBreak="No">This chapter explains some interpretive substantive theories in medical sociology including social construction of illness, trajectory of chronic illness, labelling theory, theory of social stigma, the total institution theory, and a note on postmodernism. All of the substantive theories are based on microanalysis, subjectivity, and the idiographic approach. The social construction of illness focuses on how social forces or context shape human understanding of illness. It focuses on the social origin of disease and how individuals also construct responses within a sociocultural context. The social construction of illness indicates that illness does not mean the same across cultures and that it depends on the perception of the individuals. The key references here include Kleinmann’s explanatory model of health and illness, focusing on perceived aetiology, symptoms, pathophysiology, course of illness, and treatment. The peculiarities of chronic illness are explored with a model developed by Corbin and Strauss. Then, two social reaction theories, namely labelling theory and the theory of social stigma, are presented. Reference is made to the works of Howard S. Becker and other classical proponents of labelling theory. After the discussion of the features of labelling theory with the aid of a framework, reference is made to the works Thomas Scheff and Walter Gove, who are leading proponents in the application of labelling theory to mental illness. The later part of the discussion relates to the application of the labelling theory to mental illness. Two important theoretical stances from Erving Goffman (1922–1982) are presented—the theories of stigma and total institution. Some emerging trends of the classical ideas of Goffman are examined.</Para>

            </ExternalRef>). Particularly in medical sociology, the application of the perceptive has been traced to the works of Erving Goffman, Anselm Strauss, Eliot Freidson, Becker S. Howard<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Becker, H.S.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, and Michel Foucault<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Foucault, M.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, among others. The perspective here stems from the traditional conception of social constructionist approach and not that of Brown (<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2008</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Brown, P.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, which is a fusion of constructionism and structuralism. In sum, the perspective is based on microanalysis<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Microanalysis</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, subjectivity<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Subjectivity</Primary>

              <Primary>Voluntarism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. The foundation of this microanalysis is the belief that realities are socially constructed. The meanings of any phenomena are not necessarily inherent to the phenomena themselves but develop through interaction in a particular social context (Conrad and Barker <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2010</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Conrad, P.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>
            <IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Barker, K.K.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Patients often construct realities around the disease based on sociocultural milieu. As Singer (<CitationRef CitationID="CR65">2004</CitationRef>, p. 9)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Singer, M.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> observed, this perspective is an alternative to the biomedical notion of disease “as a category in nature, a finite and objective reality discoverable through scientific endeavour…” It is also an alternative to the structuralist perspective of health. It focuses on the social origin of disease and how individuals construct certain responses to illness within a sociocultural context. The social construction of illness<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Social construction of illness</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> indicates that illness does not mean the same across cultures and that it depends on the perception of individuals. This perspective also unravels the nature of clinical interaction.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Kleinman et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR45">2006</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Kleinman, A.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> noted that the illness process begins with personal awareness of a change in the way the body feels and continues with the labelling<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Labelling</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> of the sufferer by family or by self as “ill.” This definition of being ill marks the beginning of the sick role process. It also marks the selection of a care provider and associated modalities channelled towards recovery. The starting point in the understanding of illness behaviour is to understand the perception of illness based on the social construction of illness or what could also be called lay perception or the explanatory model of illness. More often than not, the lay perception is different from the biomedical notion of disease (refer to the distinction between illness and disease in Chap. <ExternalRef>
              <RefSource>2</RefSource>
              <RefTarget Address="10.1007/978-3-319-03986-2_2" TargetType="DOI"/>
            </ExternalRef>). In short, illness refers to the personal, interpersonal, and cultural manifestation or experience of disease or discomfort (Frankenberg <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">1980</CitationRef>; Kleinman et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR45">2006</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Frankenberg, R.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>
            <IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Kleinman, A.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. The definition of illness requires personal and social interpretation and judgment. Such interpretation is based on cultural factors governing perception, labelling, explanation, and valuation of the discomforting experience (Fabrega <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">1972</CitationRef>; Kleinman et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR45">2006</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Fabrega, H.</Primary>

            <IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Kleinman, A.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. The interpretation of illness also depends on many individual attributes such as knowledge, education, and class position. This is why illness is often experienced within a cultural milieu.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The construction of illness which forms the patient’s explanatory model comprises five indices (Kleinman <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">1978</CitationRef>; Kleinman et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR45">2006</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

An individual may develop causal explanations that are “unthinkable” in biomedical terms. A supernatural explanation of disease is beyond scientific comprehension. It is a part of the cultural beliefs as it forms an important defining stance in the understanding of disease. This is similar to the first stage in the construction of disease, which Brown (<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">1995</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                    </IndexTerm> called <Emphasis Type="Italic">identification and diagnosis</Emphasis>. The beginning involves recognition of a medical problem through direct experience. According to Brown, there may be conflictual notions of the disease. AIDS was first associated with zoosexuality<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                    </IndexTerm> and subsequently with the unsafe exchange of bodily fluid through various means, especially sexual intercourse. There may be a gradual shift in belief or lay conception as more facts are emerging.</Para>

The cultural repertoire designates certain signs attributable to disease, from which disease could be categorised. If such symptoms are identified, then the individual can be categorised as ill. Most times, the extent to which a condition disrupts daily activities may indicate the signs and symptoms from a lay construction of illness. This is close to what Brown described as <Emphasis Type="Italic">experience of illness</Emphasis>. There may not be uniform experience from a particular disease. The experience of illness also shapes how the disease is defined and how rights and obligations are constructed. While obesity<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

In other words, illness may have disabling manifestations. Therefore, patients evaluate the extent of disturbances of bodily functions caused by a disease. This shows the level of underlying and potential abnormalities or threats from the disease. The perceived threat is also socially defined. This is also part of the experience of illness. It should be noted that in social construction, the physical manifestation is not in itself a problem but the consequences of such manifestation. Such consequences may involve interpersonal crisis, alienation, and stigmatisation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

There are often two major notions: the patient’s and the physician’s notions. In other words, an explanatory model reveals the meaning people attach to their illness and their experiences of it. The patient’s model reveals how people view their illness in terms of how it happens, what causes it, how it affects them, and how it can be resolved. The major goal of most qualitative research is to understand the explanatory model of illness or disease held by individuals in the community by revealing the local understanding and knowledge of the health problem. There is often more focus on the patient’s explanatory model because it is borne out of illness experience and cultural context.</Para>

            </IndexTerm>. Apart from the personal experience of discomfort, there is the relational dimension. When people discriminate against other people living with a particular disease, it becomes part of the experience of the illness. A person living with a certain disease may find it difficult to socialise with others, engage in recreational activities, and adhere to certain diets. Activities that were previously conventional may become unconventional, and this accounts for a shrinking social world (Charmaz <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">1991</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm>. As the patient progresses to accept and manage their condition, they experience diminishing fear of the disease and develop a sense of self-control or self-immunity. For some diseases, the initial reaction could be denial, an attempt to assume the condition is not real or the diagnosis could be wrong. With progression towards the experience of the symptoms of the condition, fear may arise; this could be fear of pain, incurability, financial burden, judgement of others, and other associated pressures.

              <Primary>Sontag, S.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> noted that the negative subjective experience of disease condition (e.g., cancer) and the symbolic meaning of horror attached to it are detrimental to the patient and exact adverse effects on disease control. Such negative metaphors or myths of a disease kill faster than the disease itself (Sontag <CitationRef CitationID="CR67">1978</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Primary>Significant others</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, and caregivers in managing the illness condition. In other words, the illness trajectory refers to the course of an illness, to all the related work, as well as the impact on both the workers and their relationships that further affect the management of the course of illness and the fate of the sick person (Corbin and Strauss <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">1985</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> introduced the concept of labelling—and provided an explanation of labelling, attribution, and “acceptance” of status—and laid the foundation of a theoretical movement called labelling theory. What then are labels? Labels<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Labels</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> are constructed as working definitions of a condition within a sociocultural context.

A disease might be labelled as mild or serious; it might not elicit a negative reaction. A condition might be labelled as inevitable and normal. Nausea during pregnancy<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            <Para TextBreak="No">Becker’s arguments are first applied in the study of deviant behaviour. The central argument is that society creates labels and applies them in the definition of any pathology or condition.

A similar act/behaviour may be defined differently by another audience or in another context. Becker (<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">1963</CitationRef>, p. 9)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The characteristics of the individual, social networks, disease, and structural context play important roles in the definition of a condition and application of the label. The disease characteristics mediated by the form of social, behavioural, and physical manifestations as well as sociomedical consequences create subjective attributions which lead to the formulation of a definition and application of a label. Sociomedical consequences especially relate to the control of the disease (e.g., whether curable or not) and the extent of biographic disruption<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> to mental illness, Thomas Scheff is a leading proponent with his publication <Emphasis Type="Italic">Being Mentally Ill: A Labelling Theory</Emphasis>. Actions that are often labelled are typically those that do not fit socially constructed norms. Such behaviours constitute social deviance in the society. Scheff (<CitationRef CitationID="CR62">1966</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Scheff, T.J.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> argued that society generates mental illness by labelling social deviance as such. In other words, those behaviours that are not within societal norms are often regarded as indicators of mental illness. Those who are regarded as mentally derailed are subjectively defined as such, and all their behaviours are considered abnormal. The label situates them as defined, and over time they tend to fulfil the expectation of the label by exhibiting abnormal behaviours.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Scheff (<CitationRef CitationID="CR64">2010</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> observed that when an individual is diagnosed with a mental illness, cultural ideas associated with the mentally ill become personally relevant. The societal expectations (from the mentally ill) become a lens through which a patient’s behaviour is evaluated. People are being labelled; they are seen as being mentally ill instead of having a mental illness (Pasman <CitationRef CitationID="CR54">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Pasman, J.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Therefore, according to labelling theory, the label of being mentally ill actually causes one to be mentally ill as a result of effects described as the Thomas theorem<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                <Primary>Labels</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> as if they actually cause mental illness without considering the psychiatric perspective which focuses more on actual (biomedical) diagnosis. Gove observed that Scheff neglected to take into account the influence of psychopathological variables in mental illness. To him, labelling theory should be integrated into the psychiatric perspective as an adjunctive theory which highlights potential problems in psychiatric practice. Therefore, the objective theoretical thinking should be at the mid-point between Scheff and Gove. This signifies a fusion of social and biomedical models. It upholds Gove’s argument that labelling is not the full cause of mental illness but significantly contributes to the definition of mental illness. The fact still remains that most manifestations of mental illness have behavioural dimensions which usually create social reaction.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Labelling also has some positive aspects. Labelling suggests the adoption of the sick role, especially excusable behaviour and exemption from normal duties. It suggests the possibility of a discrepancy between an acceptable standard of behaviour and abnormality. This may stimulate the labelled to seek treatment. It helps the patient to seek competent help in order to normalise behaviour. Labelling is also a form of lay diagnosis. It creates awareness and understanding of illness condition. Unfortunately, the consequences of a negative label could be harmful. It leads to low self-esteem, impaired self-efficacy<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The first account of stigma as a symbolic mark on humans is documented in the Bible (later in the Quran) as the mark of Cain; the mark has its origin in the criminal act (murder of his brother, Abel) committed by Cain. Since then, various degrading stigmata have been used in human history.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Social stigma is a mark or attribution of shame, disgrace, or social devaluation. Goffman (<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">1963</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>; the gap shows a discrediting effect. A virtual social identity is one created by people through subjective evaluation of other people; it acts as an interaction interface that has the tendency to predominate the actual social identity. Stigma exists when there is a negative gap between the virtual identity and actual identity. Impliedly, stigma emanates from social interaction; this is why Goffman called it a language of relationship and not an attribute. It is a socially discrediting status ascribed to an individual that is indicative of a social difference from others. Simply, according to Goffman, stigmatisation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Physical characteristics could form a source of social degradation. Campbell and Deacon (<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2006</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>, dystrophy, dwarfism, and autism. Blemishes of individual character or deviations in personal traits constitute the second type. These are traits which are unusual, unnatural, or asocial. These forms of deviation present a discrepancy from the normative and collective norms of the society. Examples include treacherous and rigid beliefs, dishonesty, mental disorders, imprisonment, addiction, alcoholism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Alcoholism</Primary>

              </IndexTerm> described this deviation of personal traits as achieved stigma—where the role or behaviour of an individual is the source of stigma. The last type is tribal stigma<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                <Primary>Falk, G.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> described this as existential, a kind of stigma that is a result of ascription or natural attributes. The stigmatised have no control over the attributes. In this case, caste and class systems, especially where the social gap is wide, are accompanied with stigma. Atrocities committed by some members of a group may put others at the risk of stigma. For example, a long-bearded Muslim cleric may be branded as a fanatic and thus as a possible terrorist suspect, especially in the United States<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> as a personal trait that is stigmatised. During that time, homosexuality was not tolerated and was considered a medical abnormality and even a criminal act. While it has been normalised in many western nations, it is still a contested or stigmatised trait in many African societies. The implication is that stigma is a relative attribution. It varies by period, place, and person. There may be successions of alteration in attributes that are stigmatised over a period of time. Goffman (<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">1963</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> observed that “an attribute that stigmatises one type of possessor can confirm the usualness of another, and therefore is neither creditable nor discreditable as a thing in itself.” This also signifies that stigma is a social creation, not the attribute of the “mark” itself. A dwarf who belongs to the upper class may enjoy adequate social tolerance unlike one in the lower class.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Goffman discussed three categories of individuals in relation to stigma. The first are the stigmatised, or those who bear the stigma or label that is discreditable or discredited. They live with the burden of the stigma in everyday life. For them, the experience of stigma is a reality that creates a “battle” between them and others in the society. Most times, it limits their social participation and forces them to explore life opportunities only at the margins of the society. Stigma can be dehumanising and depersonalising. Second, the “normal” constitute the majority who do not bear any stigma. Most times they are those who place<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Place</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> stigma on others by imposing discredited status on others. The last category is the wise, those who are tolerable of the stigmatised, those who hold unconditional love for the discredited persons<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Persons</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. The wise are often empathetic and sympathetic; hence, they are highly tolerable of the stigmatised and do not allow the stigma to mediate social interaction.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">One major criticism of this theory is the vagueness of the concept of stigma. Link and Phelan (<CitationRef CitationID="CR48">2001</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

A label is like a tag that is affixed, beckoning to be seen or recognised, like the band with the captain in a football match.

              <Heading>Differences Associated with Negative Attributes</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Labels do not automatically lead to stigma unless they are associated with negative attributes. This component occurs when labelled differences are linked to stereotypes. Within a particular context, labelled differences are linked with undesirable attributes. Drinking alcohol in and of itself might not be a negative act, but among the groups that forbid such act it can generate a label (drunkard) and induce a negative attribute. Additionally, a label of “mentally ill” may link a person to a stereotype of being dangerous, unfit, unstable, unreliable, incompetent, and so forth. The visibility of a potential discreditable attribute contributes to stigmatisation. For instance, HIV status has the potential to be stigmatised if it is known within a social network. If a person is able to conceal such a status, he/she may be saved from stigmatisation. This is why most people with a “discreditable” attribute such as a HIV-positive status hide it.

                </IndexTerm> about labelled differences are also influenced by the degree to which they are believed to pose a danger or threat to a particular group. If an individual living with mental illness is perceived to be dangerous, he/she may experience social distance, the same way many people will keep away from PLWHA<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)</Primary>
                </IndexTerm> because of the misunderstanding that it could be contagious through mere interaction. The perception that an illness may be the victim’s fault (or responsibility) can also lead to stigmatisation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The power of the majority has a powerful voice in how a situation is defined. Such a voice is portrayed or convened through ideological apparatuses including the media. Gradually, a negative attribution becomes dominant and the stigmatised find themselves in the lower stratum of the society.

The attributes of the disease and local understanding affects the formation of a response. Some diseases (e.g., mental illness) affect social relationships and could be difficult to conceal. Responses (including behavioural disposition, attitude, and cognitive reactions) are formed based on such disease characteristics. Stigmatisation is consequential for the stigmatised through experience of both internal and external stigma. External stigma could be measured by a number of indicators including avoidance, rejection, moral judgment, unwillingness to invest in the stigmatised, discrimination, and abuse. Internal stigma, on the other hand, could be measured by self-exclusion from services and opportunities, perception of self, social withdrawal, and fear of disclosure (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">8.3</InternalRef>).</Para>

              </IndexTerm> are formally accommodated based on certain criteria; everyone is under the authority of the establishment. Second, patterned activities are carried out with like-situated others with similar treatment. Daily activities are often specified for all members and are carried out with other persons with similar characteristics (e.g., a mental health facility is differentiated from a home for the blind). Third, activities are tightly scheduled and prearranged. Daily activities are structured using a daily time-table, with one activity leading to another at a prearranged time. Fourth, formal rules and officials guide daily life of the inmates. The organisation of daily activities is not a matter of choice but is imposed by the authority and implemented by officials. Fifth, activities are bureaucratically structured to fulfil an organisational goal: every total institution has a goal; for instance, a total institution<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Total institution</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> may be organised to rehabilitate inmates. Sixth, restriction from wider social contacts is enforced. Social distance is prescribed in a total institution. This is a major defining characteristic of the institution; it controls the movement of individuals and tightly regulates contact with the wider society. There is even limited contact with the staff of the institution; the members of the staff are positioned to administer organisation materials and ensure strict compliance with the organisational rules.</Para>

In a total institution, there is no freedom of choice or action as the inmates have a duty to surrender to the constitutive authority and, most importantly, to surrender his/her self and body.

          <Para TextBreak="No">While the term “postmodern” has a long history in literature, its place in sociology can be dated back to the 1970s. Postmodernism represents an attempt at a paradigm shift following arguments that most modern theory cannot accommodate the new developments in human society and explain them appropriately. The first major criticism of the MSTs is that they are too ambitious through grand narratives and universalistic principles. Most MSTs proffer general rules governing the social worlds by focusing on the social aggregate and using a nomothetic approach. It is difficult to apply a single natural social law across social contexts (Keith <CitationRef CitationID="CR42">2005</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

It should be noted that postmodernism, like the MSTs, involves a range of different theoretical perspectives. This is why there are also a number of contentions within the postmodern perspective.

            <Heading>Some Features of a Postmodern Social Theory</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Postmodernism presents a departure from some of the classical features of the MSTs. As previously mentioned, most postmodernists start with what they describe as the failures of modern theories, which inform paradigmatic crisis and the need for a shift to more encompassing theoretical ideas that will explain the drastic developments of the new era. Postmodernism materialised out of poststructuralism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Poststructuralism</Primary>

                <Primary>Cockerham, W.C.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. The first major assumption is that there are new advances beyond modernism. There are two ways postmodernists have explained these advances: some (like Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze, and Felix Guattari) observed a drastic replacement of modernism, while others (like Fredric Jameson and Nancy Fraser) viewed it as an extension of modernism (Ritzer <CitationRef CitationID="CR59">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> within the postmodern context is difficult. Africa still consists of a majority of rural communities, some without the touch of modernity. Although globalisation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Globalisation</Primary>

). Since modernism is a result of social change that produced a new epistemological approach, it is logical that the postmodern era should also be treated with a new approach.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Postmodernism is also based on a relativistic view of reality. Relativism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Relativism</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> flows from the belief in cultural divergence, or cultural differentialism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Cultural differentialism</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. To the postmodernists, a decentering tendency due to differences across “global” localities will promote an in-depth understanding of human societies. In essence, there is a need to activate the cultural differences to allow for more theoretical and empirical probing. To the postmodernists, there is no single universal truth or reality but truths or realities constructed by the participants based on their worldview. Therefore, it is important to situate facts within these worldviews. This is why postmodernism advocates for glocalisation in relation to culture and implementation projects (Scambler <CitationRef CitationID="CR61">2002</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            <Para TextBreak="No">Postmodernism is based on critical discourse involving deconstruction<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Deconstruction</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> and reconstruction of realities. Deconstruction implies a discursive and critical questioning of traditional assumptions about realities to expose the underlying differences, especially their determinants and subjective foundation. For instance, Derrida deconstructed social structures and found only normative writings used in constraining people rather than actual “structures” (Ritzer <CitationRef CitationID="CR59">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Ritzer, G.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. As previously implied, the search for the meaning of social realities is often influenced not only by the subject but also by the contextual dynamics and space.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In addition, another postmodernist, Jean Baudrillard, insisted that the truth is what individuals project, since it can be created and controlled. The major implication is that, beyond subjective thinking, social dynamisms (e.g., power, hegemony, and hierarchy) affect human conceptualisation of realities and knowledge itself. This questions the objective foundation of knowledge and realities. Therefore, interpretation is the bedrock of reality, since interpretation is the act of making meaning of concrete and subjective experiences and writings. The process of interpretation is ever continuous. The continuity explains the fluidity of realities; it is unstable. The “truth” continues to emerge through the process of deconstruction<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Deconstruction</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> and as more meanings are reconstructed. Invariably, the postmodernist implication for sociological theorising and empiricism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Empiricism</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> is that a single coherent rationality should be avoided to pave the way for a kind of conceptual and observational multiplicity that will cater for cultural differentialism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>. The “conservative” consideration of body-with-organs is associated with modernity. Such a conservative idea implies a human body that is restricted by time and space (Fox <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">1993</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

); the body is considered an entity which is flexible and not absolutely defined by its objects (the organs). It is still a living body, not stripped (physically) of its organs, but the BwO describes the virtual dimension of the body with unlimited potentials (Deleuze and Guattari <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">1988</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Some of the theories could serve as alternatives to each other. While common ground could be observed in some theories, others present divergent views. The selection of a theory or theories could be a challenge at times. To resolve such a challenge, first, one needs to have general knowledge of theoretical perspectives and their methodological implications. Second, it is important to fully understand the problem to be studied in terms of issues to be investigated, especially whether it is micro, macro, or a combination of both. The two aforementioned issues will help to select a theory, or theories.</Para>
