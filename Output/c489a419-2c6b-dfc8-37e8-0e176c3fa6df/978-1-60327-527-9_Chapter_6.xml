            <Para TextBreak="No">T lymphocytes are a pool of cells with extremely different characteristics. First of all, every cell that derives from a certain precursor has rearranged its genes for the T cell receptor (TCR) differently from others cells. Thus, there is an extreme heterogeneity of T cells in peripheral blood due to the different TCR expressed by the cells that recognize different epitopes. In addition, T cells can be subdivided in discrete subsets, which are distinguished by the differential expression of molecules, such as CD4 and CD8, but also CD45R, CD25, CTLA-4, chemokyne receptors, etc. These molecules are variably associated to the function that a single T cell is programmed to carry out or to the differentiation stage in which at a given time that cell belongs. Moreover, the pool of peripheral cells also includes T lymphocytes with different capacity to secrete function-associated cytokines.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Many studies on T cell function may be performed by analyzing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), but since PBMC are such a heterogeneous population of cells, in many experimental settings it may be difficult to obtain clear-cut results and to attribute a certain function to a defined T cell population. The availability of a population of T lymphocytes that derives from the same progenitor (clone) with a unique phenotype and function may be of help. On the other hand, limitation on the interpretation of results must be identified also when a clone is used. A clone will consist of cells, which share the same phenotypic characteristics and function, but they may not be representative of the whole population of T lymphocytes in in vivo situations.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">T cells recognize their antigens of proteic or lipidic nature presented by antigen presenting cells (APC) in the context of diverse antigen presenting molecules (APM). Upon encounter with a APC presenting a peptide or glycolipid, for example, from bacterial origin during an infection, T cells with a TCR capable of recognizing the complex APM-Ag are activated and may proliferate, giving rise to a progeny of T cells expressing the same TCR <Emphasis Type="Italic">(</Emphasis>
              <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>
              <Emphasis Type="Italic">)</Emphasis>. Upon activation T cells synthesize their principal grow factor, the interleukin (IL)-2, and express the IL-2 receptor, which enable them to sense the IL-2 presence and continue cell division. The functional consequence of such an expansion is the availability of a large number of T cells specific for the bacterial antigen capable of giving help to B cells or to macrophages, which eventually contribute to the bacterial clearance. With the decay of antigen concentration, due to elimination of the source, i.e., bacterial clearance, the expanded T cell population ceases IL-2 synthesis and reduces the membrane expression of IL-2 receptor, so that cells progressively die. Some cells, however, remain as memory T cells. If a second infection with the same pathogen occurs, APC may present the same antigens and memory T cells are “restimulated” and rapidly expanded with a new cycle of IL-2 synthesis and IL-2 receptor expression. To isolate an antigen-specific T cell clone a strategy is used to in vitro mimic such a physiologic in vivo T cell response.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Five steps may be followed to design a T cell cloning experiment. In the first step, the precise characteristics of the required clones must be identified as well as the criteria to distinguish them from other not relevant clones. Then, the most suitable blood donor to enroll must be defined to succeed in obtaining the wanted clones. The third step includes the methods to enrich the starting pool of T lymphocytes in the required T cell population. The fourth step encompasses the methods to obtain single cell cultures and the last step is the identification, among the growing clones, of those that fulfill the criteria of selection.<OrderedList>

              <Heading>Definition of the Clone Requirements</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In the simplest case, it may be needed a random cloned population of T lymphocytes. This is the case of those experimental situations in which it is not relevant the antigen specificity of the cloned population or its function. For example, a cloned population may be an excellent tool to study signal transduction pathways <Emphasis Type="Italic">(</Emphasis>

                <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>
                <Emphasis Type="Italic">)</Emphasis>. In this category of non-selected T cell clones requirement also fall those studies that are aimed at verifying the frequency of a given character in an array of casually generated clones <Emphasis Type="Italic">(</Emphasis>
                <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>

                <Emphasis Type="Italic">)</Emphasis>. In the majority of cases, however, T cell clones are required for having certain characteristics. It may be wanted an array of T cell clones with defined antigen specificity, or with helper or cytotoxic function, or with a certain phenotype, i.e., CCR3<Superscript>+</Superscript>, CD30<Superscript>+</Superscript> or Vβ11<Superscript>+</Superscript>. The precise definition of the required populations and the strategies to identify such population are essential in planning the next steps of T cell clone generation and finally in obtaining a positive result.</Para>

              <Heading>Identification of the Donor</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Obviously, in the case of non-antigen-specific T cell clones there is no need to choose a specific donor as source of lymphocytes, thus the procedure may proceed directly to step 4. In those cases, instead, where the interest is focused on generation of T cell clones with certain antigen specificity, the source of lymphocytes becomes an important issue. For example, to obtain a single clone of antigen-specific T lymphocytes requires methods to identify and select the lymphocytes with the desired specificity among the pool of cells with different specificities present in the peripheral blood. Thus, the chances to succeed will be proportional to the frequency of the antigen-specific cells among the whole population of T lymphocytes in the blood, and this implies that the required populations of T cells must be present in the peripheral blood of certain donor. For instance, it will be relatively easy to isolate tetanus toxoid (TT) specific T lymphocytes from a healthy donor recently vaccinated against tetanus, while it will be less easy to isolate the same clones from a donor vaccinated several years before and it will be uncertain to obtain clones with the same specificity from a donor who has never been vaccinated against tetanus. Thus, recently vaccinated subjects represent a source of antigen-specific lymphocytes to enroll for the isolation of T cell clones <Emphasis Type="Italic">(</Emphasis>
                <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>
                <Emphasis Type="Italic">)</Emphasis>. Other sources for T cell clones isolation are represented by patients with or recently recovered from a certain disease, which is associated with an antigen-specific T cell expansion. Examples of such diseases are infectious or allergic diseases <Emphasis Type="Italic">(</Emphasis>
                <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>
                <Emphasis Type="Italic">)</Emphasis> and, with several limitations, also neoplastic <Emphasis Type="Italic">(</Emphasis>
                <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>

                <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>
                <Emphasis Type="Italic">)</Emphasis>. In most of these cases, peripheral blood is the ideal source of lymphocyte to isolate T cell clones. There are, however, situations in which alternative sources of lymphocytes are preferred. This is the case, for example, of lymphocytes infiltrating tumors or inflammatory sites. In this case, lymphocytes could be isolated from biopsies <Emphasis Type="Italic">(</Emphasis>

                <Emphasis Type="Italic">)</Emphasis>. Isolation of lymphocytes in these situations will be briefly described in <Emphasis Type="Bold">Section 3.5</Emphasis>. T cell population in the blood is heterogeneous, thus, if the required T cell clones are frequent, there is no need to use methods for its enrichment: for example, we would require non-specific CD4 or non-specific CD8 T cell clones. In this case, using a limiting dilution method to obtain clones, we will have almost half of the clones with the desired characteristic.</Para>

              <Heading>Strategy to Enrich the Population</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">On the other hand, if we need to clone rare T cells, the strategy to enrich the population of required cells becomes an important issue. For example, before cloning a low frequent T cell population, such as a population bearing a certain Vβ chain as part of its TCR, we might need to enrich it, by magnetic- or flow cytometric-sorting. In the case of antigen-specific T cells, that cannot be identified by their phenotype and whose frequency is very low, a primary culture to enrich in antigen-specific cells is required (<Emphasis Type="Bold">Fig.</Emphasis>

            <Para TextBreak="No">A T cell cloning is in theory a simple procedure: if we presume that the blood of a given donor contains the desired T cell population to obtain as a clone, we could isolate PBMC, count the cells and dilute the cells up to a concentration which would allow to seed only one cell in a single well and induce the proliferation of single cells with appropriate stimuli, such as PHA. We will obtain a high number of growing cells that could be screened in order to find the clones that satisfy our requirements. In practice, this procedure is almost impossible to succeed or it could be useful with an absolute negative cost–benefit ratio and a high dose of luck. Since T cells specific for a given antigen are relatively rare among the whole population of T cells that is represented by heterogeneous cells with specificity for virtually all antigens, the above mentioned procedure would require to seed thousands of wells. Moreover, a single dilution of the cell population does not assure that cells can be effectively separated in one for well as expected. A procedure of enrichment of antigen-specific cells and a method to reduce the experimental variability of the limiting dilution procedure is thus required to increase the cost–benefit of the cloning method.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">PBMC are resuspended in complete medium + 5% autologous serum at the concentration of 1×10<Superscript>6</Superscript> cell/ml. Cell suspension of 100 µl are distributed in flat-bottomed 96-well plates. In a typical experiment, 80 wells will be filled. Sixteen and 64 wells will be filled with 100 µl of complete medium + 5% autologous serum without and with antigen, respectively (<Emphasis Type="Bold">Fig.</Emphasis>

                </InternalRef>). Cultures without antigen will indicate the control basal growth of cells without antigen and will monitor whether the culture conditions are suitable for the isolation of antigen-specific T cells. In these wells, if the culture medium does not contain mitogens or unwanted antigens (present, for example, in the serum), T cells should not grow and would represent the “negative cultures”. It is important to envisage in the experimental design such a control culture, since an unwanted growth in these wells will indicate that a T cell division occurs independently on the antigen and will prevent to proceed in the next steps. A typical example of the helpfulness of control wells can be given by experiments made in FCS instead of autologous or human serum: FCS contains antigens of bovine origin as well as low endotoxin level and human T cell mitogens that induce the growth of a significant number of cells. The number of FCS responder cells will be higher than the number of T cell specific for a given antigen, rendering difficult if not impossible to isolate the desired T cell clones. Usually antigen can be added at concentration ranging from 1 to 20 µg/ml (<Emphasis Type="Italic">see</Emphasis>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Note 1</Emphasis>). However, it is not possible to provide a general rule. Since the real antigen concentration is not always what measured with colorimetric methods and since the frequency of antigen-specific cells varies as well the efficiency of APC in the wells, unless tested in advance, it is recommended to use more than one concentration of antigen (<Emphasis Type="Italic">see</Emphasis>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Note 2</Emphasis>). Thus, cultures of at least 12 replicates with different antigen concentrations may be required to find the dose that results in the best proliferation of specific cells.

              <Para TextBreak="No">A good culture will end up with no T cell growth in negative control wells and with clumps of cells distributed onto the well bottom surface with a frequency dependent on the antigen dose. After inspection, at day 5, 10 µl/well of 10 U/ml IL-2 in complete medium + 5% autologous serum medium will be added. A low IL-2 dose will now facilitate the proliferation of those cells that, following antigen recognition on the surface of APC have the IL-2 receptor CD25 up-regulated.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">At day 10, a new microscopy inspection will show that some IL-2 mediated T cell growth occurs in control wells without antigen. This proliferation, however, if the culture conditions are correct, will be limited and sporadic. On the other hand, in wells with antigen, the proliferation will be evident and some cells will now be found out of the clumps with blast morphology. At the same day 10, 10 µl/well of 50 U/ml IL-2 in complete medium + 5% autologous serum medium will be added.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Daily inspection will indicate the preferred day to proceed with the cloning experiment. The preferred day will be that day, usually the 12–15th, in which cells in the well with antigen are growing making the medium to turn pink–yellow, indicating the acidification of the medium and suggesting the need to split the medium, while cells in the wells without antigen are not yet beginning to outgrow. If cells in the wells with antigen are growing and the medium turned to yellow, but the cloning experiment cannot be performed and must be delayed, wells can be split into two. In this case a twin plate can be prepared. Using a 8- or 12-channel multipipette, mix accurately each well, and transfer 100 µl in the second plate mirroring the scheme of the first, changing the tip for every row (<Emphasis Type="Bold">Fig.</Emphasis>

Wells containing cells without antigen must be treated with the same procedure.

It is in fact not suggested to maintain in culture these lines: non-antigen-specific cells can in fact outgrow and reduce the frequency of the antigen-specific cells, reducing the efficiency of antigen-specific T cell recovery after cloning. An alternative to clone the lines at this point of the culture is represented by the possibility to restimulate them with APC and antigen (<Emphasis Type="Italic">see</Emphasis>

Moreover, if the required T cell population has a very low frequency in PBMC, it could happen that cells in the wells with antigen are not expanded enough at day 12–15 of primary culture.

              <Para TextBreak="No">After 12–15 days of primary culture in optimal conditions, T cells specific for the antigen had been stimulated and had begun to proliferate, so that their frequency at this stage is increased. However, it is well established that during the same period of culture, several other cells with different specificities are non-specifically activated and do proliferate indeed <Emphasis Type="Italic">(</Emphasis>

Thus, the 12–15 days culture contains blasts cells specific for the desired antigen, but also blast cells and resting cells with non-relevant specificity. If antigen-specific cells were present with a theoretical frequency ranging from 1:10,000 to 1:100,000 before the primary culture, after the 12–15 days of culture in the appropriate conditions their frequency may increase up to 1:10–1:100. This means that we have chances to find an antigen-specific cell for every 10–100 cells if we could separate each cell from others and allow it to grow as a clone, i.e., as the progeny of a single cell. The remaining 9–99 cells represent cells with different specificity that underwent non-specific activation or resting cells that did not die during the culture. The cloning procedure will allow separating these functionally different cells and screen for the antigen-specific cells we want to obtain.</Para>

                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">)</Emphasis>. The principle of this method relies on the possibility to dilute the cultures so that in a given volume is theoretical present a single cell. For example, if the 12–15 days culture contains 2×10<Superscript>5</Superscript> cells in the volume of 200 µl, it means that this culture contains 1,000 cell in 1 µl. If we dilute the culture 1:1,000 by picking up 1 µl of the culture and adding 999 µl of medium, the obtained diluted culture will contain 1,000 cells in 1,000 µl. Thus, every µl of this diluted solution will contain one cell that can be placed into a single well and cultured in the appropriate condition to allow its grow as a clone.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In practice, there are several problems that limit the efficiency of the procedure as described. For instance, the cell count by Boyden chambers or even by electronic counters represents a typical example of count by sample and not of the cell population to be used. In addition, the count by sample is characterized by the experimental variability that makes it almost impossible to have the real enumeration of cells, so that, practically, we may have just a good estimation of the real cell concentration. Moreover, due to the fact that often T cells grow in clumps where many cells are attached one to the others, and the electrostatic forces and superficial tension at the interfaces can prevent an equal distribution of cells in the diluted volume.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">After the 12–15 days of primary culture, the growth of cells is not always homogeneous in the different wells. A good procedure is to select and pool those wells in which cells are growing the most. Coming back to the first example, among the 32 wells with 1 µg/ml of antigen we could expect to obtain eight wells with a good T cell growth, while among the 32 wells with 10 µg/ml of antigen we could obtain 16 wells in which the growth of cells is microscopically much higher than in control wells without antigen. Since each well contains 200+10+10 µl of medium, we could then make a pool of about 1.7 ml from the first eight cultures and another pool of 3.5 ml from the other 16 cultures in two plastic tubes. We can then make a third pool, mixing part of the first and the second pool, that will be used for the limiting dilution and cloning.

                <Para TextBreak="No">To proceed to the calculations for the limiting dilution, we need to know which will be the final volume of medium that we will use for the single cultures. If we are going to use Terasaki plates, every well of these plates can be filled with a final volume of 20 µl. If we are going to use 96 well U-bottomed plastic plates, 100 µl will be the final volume of the cultures. The choice of the plate is irrelevant for the scope of the limiting dilution, but every plate has its pros and its cons. Terasaki plates require the minimum amounts of cloning medium, allowing saving components and, in particular, in IL-2 and feeder cells, but multipipette device for these plates are not currently found in all laboratories. Therefore a multistep device is required to dispense the cells in the well and with these pipettes the procedure is time consuming, boring, and a good experience of the operator is required since many times the medium does not rich the well, but is dispensed outside. Moreover, the small volume of medium per well (20 µl) imposes perfect incubation conditions to avoid fast evaporation and therefore failure of the procedure. On the other hand, 96-well plates are easier to manage than the Terasaki, but they require more room in the incubator, higher amounts of medium components, and higher number of feeder cells than Terasaki plates.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">As an example, it is described the procedure to perform a typical cloning experiment using Terasaki plates. In Terasaki plates, the final volume of each well will be 20 µl. If we could be precise in the cell count, we could make calculations to dilute cells in order to have 1 cell/20 µl per well. For the reason described above, it is not useful to trust the counting methods. If an error occurs in any step of the counting process, we could easily make a dilution that is 0.1 or 0.01 cell/20 µl, that means that we will have a well containing a growing cell every 10 or 100 wells. If we design an experiment using 1,000 wells, we could obtain only 100 or 10 growing cells, respectively. Since the frequency of antigen-specific T cells will be 1:10–1:100 we could obtain one or none antigen-specific T lymphocyte. On the other hand, if an error occurs and the real concentration of cells upon dilution will be of 2 or 10 cells/well, we could have en extremely high number of wells containing growing cells that will require a complex screening, but the positive cells that we will select with high probability will not be the progeny of a single cell. A strategy that can be used to ride over these problems is to make at least three different dilutions and analyze statistically the number of growing cells for every dilution to identify the dilution that with higher probability results as the more accurate <Emphasis Type="Italic">(</Emphasis>

                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">)</Emphasis>. For example, we can count cells and dilute them in order to have a concentration of 5 cells/well, than make a 1:5 dilution that will give rise to a concentration of 1 cell/well and a further 1:5 dilution to obtain a final concentration of 0.2 cells/well. With this strategy, there is a higher probability to find a concentration of cells that will be adequate. In the case of Terasaki plates, to obtain a concentration of 5 cells/well we need a concentration of 5 cells/20 µl that corresponds to 250 cells/ml (<Emphasis Type="Bold">Fig.</Emphasis>

As described above, the counting of the T cell line is a critical step of cloning procedure. It should be performed using a vital stain like Tripan Blue that allows to exclude dead cells and mixing up very well the suspension of cells trying to disrupt clumps. If the concentration of T lymphocyte pool is, for example, of 4×10<Superscript>5</Superscript> cells/ml, to obtain a concentration of 250 cells/ml (that will give a dilution of 5 cells/well) we have to make a 1:1,600 dilution (400,000/250=1,600). The dilution 1:1,600 can be dividend in three serial dilutions: 1:16, 1:10, and a last 1:10. We can mix up very well the pool of cells trying to disrupt clumps and cell aggregates by passing in serial tubes with micropipettes the same volume of, for example, 500 µl, changing the tip at every passage. Then, we can make the first dilution (1:16) by adding 100 µl of our pool to 1,500 µl of medium in a new plastic tube.

It is intuitive that the number of negative wells will be low in those plates, where 5 cells/wells were seeded, and that this number will increase in plates filled with cells at lower concentrations. However, the experimental confirmation of this trend is important, since it indicates that dilutions have been performed correctly and that the distribution of cells upon dilution was free and not constrained by, for example, cell adhesiveness or electrostatic forces. In addition, a linear increase of the number of negative wells and the confrontation with the theoretical increase that should be observed as obtained in several experimental settings for statistical purposes <Emphasis Type="Italic">(</Emphasis>

Not all the cells of a culture will divide and grow, some of them being, for example, at the end of the life cycle or have begun a programmed cell death due to environmental conditions. It has been demonstrated with several experimental procedures, including the physical seeding of single cells in individual wells using a microscopic micromanipulator, that when single cells of a given population are independently seeded in different wells, as an average only 63% of them divide determining the growth of a progeny.

                  </InternalRef> reports an example of results obtained in three independent experiments in which the plating efficiency varies notably. In the first experiment (A), the percentage of negative wells obtained with all the dilutions always is higher than 37. We can conclude that even if cells were diluted to a theoretical concentration of 5, 1, and 0.2 cell/well, due to errors of counting or to the characteristic of the cell line, in practice less than one cell per well grew in all the seeded wells. Practical consequence of this is that all the lines independently grown that have been obtained are likely to represent progeny of single cells, i.e., clones. On the other hand, in the experiment (C) the T cell lines obtained from the cultures in the wells in which 5, 1, and 0.2 cell/well were seeded, according to the dilution initially made, cannot be considered as clones, because the percentage of negative culture is below 37 in all the cultures. The most likely explanation for this result is that the number of cells in the primary culture pool was underestimated, so that the dilution corresponding to 0.2 cell/well probably contained more than 1 cell/well, and consequently a higher number of cells than the estimated was seeded in the other conditions too. Lastly, experiment (B) reproduces the result of the plating efficiency more commonly obtained in which the experimental frequency is similar to what expected. In this experiment, in fact approximately 48% of negative cultures were observed in the group of plates, where 1 cell/well was seeded.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A practical consequence of the results shown with this analysis is that if antigen-specific responses will generate the line depicted in experiment (C), a more accurate evaluation of the responder line should be made, since there is an high probability that the positive cell line will not be a clone, but a mixture of cells not all antigen responder. On the other hand, the high number of T cell lines obtained in the experiment (A) will increase the chance to find an antigen-specific T cell clone also among those lines derived from plates in which 5 cells/well were theoretically seeded.</Para>

PBMC will be used to obtain an EBV transformed B cell line and frozen to be used as APC in primary and possibly restimulation cultures. Tissue may derive from biopsies of surgery samples and care must be given to the sterile preparation of the tissues. The tissue is to be treated to reduce its mass (in the case of surgery samples) and immersed in culture medium in the presence of antibiotics. Then the tissue must be finely minced under sterile conditions and passed trough a fine plastic sterile net (nylon cell strainer 40 µm) to allow lymphocytes to enter in suspension. In some circumstances, incubation of the minced tissues with enzymes such as collagenase can help to increase the recover of lymphocytes. The cell suspension must be washed twice at low rpm (100) to remove the tissue fragments and the supernatant can be layered onto a Ficoll cushion to isolate lymphocytes. The density gradient isolation may not be required if erythrocytes and other cell contaminants are not relevant and if T cell counting for immediate cloning is not required. In fact, in the majority of cases, the chances to obtain a growing line and clones from tissues increase if cells are not stimulated soon after the isolation from tissues. Since in tissues are more often found cells with effector function and with an activated phenotype due to specific and non-specific stimulation due to the inflammatory environment of the tissue, cells should be maintained in culture for not less that 3–7 days in the medium containing 100 U/ml of IL-2. Then, cells can be stimulated in the presence of the relevant antigen and autologous APC as described for the primary culture. However, the number of cells in this case is usually limited. Thus a proportional number of APC must be calculated and generally a limited number of wells can be programmed. In any case a negative culture in the absence of antigen is required.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">A rare T cell population in the blood may be enriched by T cell magnetic- or flow cytometric-sorting. These two methods allow the physical separation of cell subpopulations from a heterogeneous mixture of cell types and rely on the availability of an appropriate monoclonal antibody or a mix of monoclonal antibodies that identify the cell types to be separated. Both these methods can be performed in positive or negative mode utilizing antibodies direct against the required cell population or against all the other cell types, respectively. Their advantages over other antibody-mediated selection techniques are purity of resulting cell preparation and reproducibility of separation. Cell separation using flow cytometry involves scanning and sorting individual cells and generally leads to a cell population of higher purity than that obtained with other techniques but suffers from the disadvantage that the number of cells obtained is limited and time necessary to perform cell-sorting increases proportionally to the purity required. Immuno-magnetic purification of T cells is an easier and less expensive method than the flow cytometric-sorting, since it does not require sophisticated instrumentation and allows handling of larger number of cells, but purity of the recovered populations is reduced in comparison to cytometric-sorting. In both cases, a significant factor limiting the purity of the recovered cell populations is represented by cell clumping, and care must be given to obtain single cell suspension of samples to sort.</Para>

Cell proliferation is determined by estimating the incorporation of <Superscript>3</Superscript>H-thymidine into DNA during stimuli-induced mitosis. <Superscript>3</Superscript>H-thymidine can be added after 2 (when using T cell clones and lines) or 6 days of culture (when using PBMC) at 1 µCi/well and left in culture from 6 to 18 h in humidified 37°C, 5% CO<Subscript>2</Subscript>incubator.

Thus, it is important to freeze several aliquots of each cell line and clone (as soon as sufficient numbers of cells became available) for future use and when a T cell clone or line is not necessary for experiments. To recover cells in good condition upon thawing, T cell lines and clones are frozen after 5–7 days from the last stimulation.

This intermediate –70°C incubation is important to inhibit any metabolic activity of the cells in the presence of DMSO. Moreover, to improve the vitality of cells at thawing by avoiding the formation of crystals within the cells, cryovials should be placed into “freezing can” containing ethanol or into a polystyrene box. These procedures cause the temperature of the cells within the cryovials to decrease linearly. Frozen cell lines and clones are stable at –70°C for approximately a week (recovered viability slowly decreases over a period of 4 weeks). Conservation of cells for longer period is possible if cryovials are transferred into liquid nitrogen containers. The concentration of cells in each aliquot may vary: in general, a range of 1×10<Superscript>6</Superscript>–1×10<Superscript>7</Superscript> T cells per aliquot is adequate to obtain a good recovery after thawing.</Para>

The differences are related to the different antigens that stimulate CD8+ T cells and to the antigen processing pathway that allows a given peptide to bind MHC class I. The majority of soluble antigen, when picked-up by APC is internalized by phagocytosis–endocytosis and targeted to phagosomes-late endosomes, where they intersect the MHC class II pathway so that digested peptides are associated to these HLA molecules. Consequently, MHC class II specific CD4+ T cells are likely to be activated. The generation of a CD8+ T cell line can be obtained using peptides, which directly bind MHC class I.

                <Heading>Generation of CD1-Restricted T Cell Clones</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The same procedures described for cloning of CD4 peptide-specific T cells, with some modifications, can be used to obtain CD1-restricted T cell clones. In particular, since CD1+ APC are required, the main differences are limited to the set-up of the primary culture and screening tests. To optimize the possibility to expand lipid-specific CD1-restricted T cells instead of peptide-reactive MHC class I- or II-restricted T lymphocytes, the primary culture must be set-up using DC as APC. In details, from a given donor, PBMC must be isolated twice at a 6 days interval. Obviously, from a single blood withdrawal PBMC can be isolated and frozen at least two aliquots. From the first PBMC isolation, monocytes are magnetically sorted and induced to differentiate into DC <Emphasis Type="Italic">(</Emphasis>
                  <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">)</Emphasis>. After 5 days, DC are pulsed overnight with the purified lipid antigen of interest in serum free complete medium, to allow internalization and surface expression of antigen–CD1 complexes. The pulsing in serum free medium is a procedure that, avoiding the interference by serum lipids, increases the CD1-loading with the given lipid antigen. At the 6th day, a new isolation of PBMC (or thawing of a PBMC aliquot) from the same donor is required as CD1-restricted T lymphocyte source. Then, the o/n pulsed DC can be co-cultured in complete medium together with autologous PBMC (ratio DC:PBMC=1:10) and 5% serum, in the presence of blocking anti-MHC class I and class II monoclonal antibodies (at 5 µg/ml). The next steps of primary culture expansion and cloning are identical to the procedure related to peptide-specific T cell clone generation described above .</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The screening of the antigen-specific CD1-restricted T cell clones among all the growing clones presents some differences with the MHC class II-restricted T cell clone screening. First of all, the source of APC, in this case, is represented by DC, thus thawing of a further aliquot of PBMC (or a new isolation of PBMC from the same donor) is required 4–7 days before the screening test to induce monocyte differentiation into DC. Then, instead of the o/n pulsing of APC, the lipid antigen is given to DC at the optimal dose and left in the culture of APC and responder T clones. In particular, two aliquots of DC are prepared: one without and the other with the lipid antigen. After a 2 h incubation in serum free medium at 37°C, to allow the loading of CD1 molecules with the lipid antigen, T cell clones are added with a DC:T ratio 1:10. Lastly, autologous DC are of help in the screening, but DC from any donor can be used in all other lipid antigen-specific clones test, since CD1 are non-polymorphic molecules. A typical screening includes a first test with autologous DC, to screen for all the antigen-specific T cell clones regardless of restriction element. Then, a second antigen presentation assay can be performed using diverse sources of allogeneic DC to identify the CD1-restricted lipid antigen-specific clones. As a last confirmation test, an antigen presentation assay in the presence of anti MHC class I and II and anti CD1 monoclonal antibodies (at 5 µg/ml) will identify the restriction element <Emphasis Type="Italic">(</Emphasis>

                    <Para TextBreak="No">A constrain in the generation of human antigen-specific T cell clones is the availability of a purified antigen. Several antigens can be purchased from the market, such as TT, or isolated from a given pathogen or cell or chemically synthesized. In general, the more purified is the antigen, the higher will be the chance to obtain a population of specific T cell clones. For example, a recombinant protein produced in <Emphasis Type="Italic">Escherichia coli</Emphasis> would represent an excellent source of antigen. However, care must be given to highly purify the recombinant protein from products of the bacterial cells in which the protein has been synthesized. Since every human being has daily contacts with <Emphasis Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis>, the frequency of T cells specific for <Emphasis Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis> proteins is high in the peripheral blood of almost all the individuals. Thus, the culture of T lymphocytes with a recombinant protein produced in <Emphasis Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis> without a high purification from bacterial products has high probability to give rise to a T cell line specific for <Emphasis Type="Italic">E. coli</Emphasis> antigen possibly “contaminated” by T cells specific for the recombinant protein. In any case, if a recombinant protein is to be used as source of antigen, a protein extract from the vector will be required to exclude unwanted specificities in the antigen-responsiveness tests that have been described above.</Para>

For example, if we have defined that the best concentration for TT to be used is 1 µg/ml and that recently vaccinated subjects have a high response so that in the first experiment a high number of 96 wells with this dose of antigen end-up as positive, we could simply prepare a primary culture by seeding cells at 5×10<Superscript>6</Superscript>/ml in 24-well plates filled with 2 ml of complete medium supplemented with 5% autologous serum. We could prepare two wells without antigen, as negative control, and from two to five wells with antigen at the previously defined dose. IL-2 will be added at the same concentrations indicated above at day 5 and 10. If needed, wells could be split in neighbor wells using the same medium, until cloning.</Para>

This will cause the death of the cells. To avoid evaporation of the well content, it is preferable to use an incubator that is not utilized for the culture of other cells, so that you can avoid opening it for the all culture period. It is also suggested to add an extra 2 l of sterile water in a flat and opened plastic or metallic container to increase the humidity in the incubator. In addition, the plates must not be microscopically inspected until the 12th day. Inspection under the microscope will increase the evaporation rate and the number of dry wells will increase, accordingly.</Para>

                    <Para TextBreak="No">Screening assays of many clones may be complex, since IL-2 in the culture must be washed out from every clone culture. It is possible to wash many clones at contemporaneously by the use of a refrigerated centrifuge with a rotor allowing the 96 wells microplate canister. In the plate for antigen presentation test, each clone should be moved in two wells: one to be challenged with APC without antigen, the other with APC pulsed with antigen. Since clones to be screened are growing in 96-well plates in 200 µl of medium, a simple procedure will permit their transfer to plates for the antigen specificity test. Using a 8-channel micropipette, each clone can be transferred in the plate for the antigen presentation test with a procedure similar to that depicted in <Emphasis Type="Bold">Fig.</Emphasis>

                      </InternalRef>. In details, from each vertical row of the growing plate, move 60 µl of clone to the first and second rows of the test plate. In this case, in the culture plate approximately 80 µl of each clone will remain for further culture and restimulation. When this procedure will be repeated for all the clones with the same multipipette 140 µl of medium is added to each clone in the test plate and 120 µl of complete medium +IL-2 is added to the growing culture plates. The plate for growing is moved to the incubator for culture, while the test plates are spun in the centrifuge and clones washed twice with medium without IL-2.</Para>
