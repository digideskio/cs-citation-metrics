          <Para TextBreak="No">Climate change and research outputs greatly affect land productivity and performance of dependable food crops such as cassava, millet and sorghum. Interventions that enrich these crops particularly pearl millet and cassava are discussed showing that the use of fertilizers can greatly enhance crop yields. Cassava, a cheap source of carbohydrates but nutritionally poor protein source can be fortified through improved processing and fortification methods. Pearl millet too, can be fortified to add essential minerals that are absent in this dependable crop growing in poor mineral deficient soils. Mitigation of food and nutritional insecurity including severe protein malnutrition rampant in many cassava and pearl millet growing areas are highlighted showing that protein malnutrition is occasioned by inadequate access to animal based proteins by the majority of the people in the small-scale agricultural production sector dependent on cassava as their staple food crop. Most diets of these small-scale producers in these areas derive their proteins largely from traditional vegetable sources, such as beans and leafy vegetables which are inherently low in protein content. High protein legumes such as cowpeas and soybeans not widely incorporated into these people’s diets are recommended to be intercropped and incorporated into pearl millet and cassava flour milling.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Globally, it has been acknowledged that there is a large risk that will be caused by continued release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The risk is in the form of a range of adverse impacts including global warming, sea level rise, increase of storms, changes in historical patterns of rainfall (and drought), threats to endangered habitats and the possible spread of contagious diseases. Even if the countries of the world agree to take aggressive steps to stabilize or reduce CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> emissions over the next 20–50 years, it is still feared that there is a strong possibility that the cumulative effects of past greenhouse gas emissions will cause sea level to rise and storms to intensify for at least the next several decades, and probably longer (Susskind <CitationRef CitationID="CR026">2009</CitationRef>). Temperatures in Southern Africa have been increasing while lower rainfall with greater variability is expected. Higher temperatures rises will boost evaporation rates, leading to severe water shortages which will negatively affect agricultural productivity. An increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as droughts are also predicted to increase substantially (Reid et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">There is sufficient evidence suggesting significant changes in global climate over the past century, and that this phenomenon will continue throughout the twenty-first century due to anthropogenic activities as well as natural cycles (UNDP <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2009</CitationRef>; NCCF <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">2007</CitationRef>). Agriculture in Southern Africa is extremely vulnerable to predicted changes in climatic elements such as rainfall variability and unreliability. Persistently high temperatures keep evaporation rates at astronomical levels consequently limiting moisture availability to crops reducing yields of dependable crops such as cassava and pearl millet. The overall impacts of these weather attributes will no doubt affect the hydrology of the region limiting the potential for supplemental irrigation thus breeding uncertainty surrounding agricultural productivity that will be a threat to regional food security (Dirkx et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The prolonged droughts of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s saw very low food yields which precipitated an already bad situation that sent food self sufficiency into disarray culminating into food shortages, hunger and even famines. It is documented that the devastating 1991–1992 drought resulted into 45 % fall of agricultural production across Southern Africa to the extent that a food gap was felt throughout the region, more so in arid areas such as those in Namibia where food deficits resulted into acute hunger and malnutrition in many parts of the country particularly in the northern areas where majority of the small-scale agricultural producers live. The food deficit and relief food demands emerged as a major social issue of concern to policy makers across all countries in Southern Africa. Most national governments were forced to divert funds from investment in order to import relief food. During this period food crop harvests fell by a large margin; for example cereal harvests in Namibia fell by 70 % (Hirji et al <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Previous to independence of most countries in Southern Africa, paucity in research on traditional crops produced by small-scale producers was widespread. During the colonial rule in Southern Africa, cash crops such as grapes, sisal, cotton, grapes, green beans, sugar-cane, coffee, tea and cut flowers were accorded a great deal of attention in form of research, extension services and provision of agricultural inputs at the expense of traditional subsistence crops such as millet, sorghum, pearl millet (<Emphasis Type="Italic">mahangu</Emphasis>) and cassava. At the time, such malady did not attract much attention because population numbers were low and increased demand that called for increased production was attained through farm area expansion. However as the population numbers increased and demand for land grew exponentially particularly after many countries attained independence, the negative impact of paucity in research and inherent neglect on traditional subsistence crops became apparent. Land output remained constant or at worst declined due to falling soil fertility resulting from continuous use of the same parcel of land for a long time. Meanwhile demand for food production escalated due to rapidly growing population numbers as the result of improved health and lowered mortality rates. As population numbers increased the pressure on the land and its resources also increased causing rapid decline in soil fertility and crop yields across the region. It is a known fact that low soil fertility and land degradation characterizes many parts of the region particularly those areas which have been in use for generations. Thus research addressing these issues is of paramount importance.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Across Southern Africa, agricultural research, availability of agricultural inputs as well as extension services are essential in increasing land productivity and securing food self sufficiency among small-scale agricultural producers. It is widely recognized that substantial increase in agricultural production demands new innovations in agricultural practices, in farming methods and in the use of qualitative genetic materials of both plants and animals. Equally recognized is the fact that demand-driven agricultural research that is strongly geared towards the development and applications of best practices is the key factor to success. The Indian Green Revolution Policy provides a classic example of what impact good research policy can bring to bear on agricultural performance.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Some small-scale agricultural producers as well as other stakeholders in Southern Africa are still skeptical on the value of agricultural research because of held perceptions that this research has not produced significant impact on agricultural productivity, poverty reduction and food security. However, it should be remembered that research input takes time to be seen especially where the consumers of research findings and recommendations fail to adopt these recommendations as specified by the researchers. Often the customers of research findings prefer to stick to their traditional methods of production because these are what they know and the ones that have supported previous generations. Therefore the research agenda should be revisited prudently while increasing funding and investments in agricultural research activities that will lead to improved technology development and strengthen extension services so as to convince and support the research findings consumers.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">At the continental level, Pillar 4 of the New Economic Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)’s Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) also focuses on enhancing and improving the effectiveness of agricultural research and development with aim of improving agricultural production in keeping in line with one of the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of achieving 50 % reduction in poverty by 2015 and attaining 6 % growth in agriculture production per annum. This goal can best be attained by continuously realigning research agenda to fit the need and the aspirations of the agricultural sector particularly that which supports the small-scale agricultural sector. Thus policy research that informs decision-making process in areas that encourage efficient use of inputs as well as promoting sustainable cropping systems is required. Required research policy must also include a thorough understanding of decisions taken at household levels. The required research must also address integrated management of natural resources as well as marketing, product processing, value addition and nutritional requirements.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Meanwhile throughout Southern Africa, relevant government ministries have embarked on measures to increase land productivity and promote crop diversifications as part of strategies to improve food security and reduce poverty among small-scale agricultural producers. Promoting soil erosion control and cubing land degradation and value addition to agricultural produce are among strategies identified as viable means of meeting these goals. Additional strategies include strengthening extension service to the small-scale agricultural sector through information dissemination and advisory services aimed at changing small-scale producers’ perceptions and attitudes towards adopting improved technologies and good agricultural practices. Strategies adopted by government research departments include practical research programs which are demand-driven oriented towards addressing specific issues such as that targeting land conservation, the promotion of optimal livestock carrying capacities as well as access to local, regional and international markets particularly for those areas characterized by aridity in Botswana and Namibia. In these lands, research emphasis has been put on animal health and land carrying capacity as well as quick maturing cereals and hardy vegetables. Attention has been placed on animal products processing and marketing as well as effective and efficient livestock disease control, meat hygiene and coping strategies during critical times.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">While developing viable and appropriate research generated options to the land productivity challenge, researchers have placed specific emphasis on staple food crops including grains and root crops which constitute the main survival foods for the majority of small-scale agricultural producers. Many research scholars are of the opinion that the key to success lies in finding ways to adopt systems to natural environmental variability rather than attempting to homogenize the environment with massive inputs that are exceedingly expensive, economically unsustainable and environmentally unsound (Heinrich <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2004</CitationRef>). They also believe that developing scientific interventions that are appropriate, affordable, user-friendly and well packaged, efficient and effective in addressing specific needs will ensure success in coming up with useful interventions for the small-scale agricultural producers.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Essential to envisaged success is the availability of informed scientists who are able to skillfully analyze, synthesize and integrate agricultural research findings into indigenous knowledge and indigenous practices in order to foster smart stakeholders’ participation and partnerships. Participatory approaches would strengthen the relevancy of research findings and make technology appropriate to local conditions. Therefore for agricultural research to be relevant and useful to the consumers of new knowledge it is necessary to holistically look at agriculture research and relating it to the broader environment in which small-scale agricultural producers in the region operate.</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">Pearl millet is one of climate-smarts crops. Pearl millet is a hardy dry land cereal grain crop largely grown in the drought-prone regions of Africa and Asia where it performs better than other cereals. Pearl millet which has its origin in the Sahel zone of Western Africa was introduced into Southern and Eastern Africa about 2,000 years ago. Its tolerance to drought, heat and soil salinity and its high water use efficiency qualifies it a climate-smart crop. While pearl millet can grow on a wide variety of soils ranging from clay loams to deep sands, yields and grain quality are best on deep, well-drained sandy soils because areas with soils prone to “water logging” in wet seasons cause shallow rooting, low seed protein and poor yields (Dewey et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">To a certain extent, sorghum is also a climate-smart crop. Sorghum, grown in many localities within Southern Africa’s arid and semi-arid areas is among the most photo-synthetically efficient and fast maturing food plants which thrive on marginal sites where other crops fail. The crop faces limited productivity due to lack of improved production technologies and unavailability of improved cultivars. In cultivar development, emphasis should be placed on incorporating enormous genetic variability that has higher yields and higher moisture deficit tolerance than the indigenous varieties. Researchers should strive to raise their understanding of the varieties farmers have access to, their properties, characteristics and uses.</Para>

          <Heading>Pearl Millet and Sorghum in Namibia</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Pearl millet (<Emphasis Type="Italic">pennisetum glaucum)</Emphasis> and sorghum (<Emphasis Type="Italic">sorghum bicolour)</Emphasis> are both dependable cereal crops supporting the livelihoods of small-scale agricultural producers in Namibia. In Namibia, pearl millet and sorghum are popularly planted in one field with pearl millet occupying the larger portion of a field. Both pearl millet and sorghum flourish in dry sandy soils with low fertility and low pH (high salinity); both crops have extreme genetic diversity and high tolerance to heat and meager soil moisture conditions. It is documented that a great percentage of Namibia has the lowest soil fertility in Southern Africa. This is more so in the northern parts of the country where the situation among small-scale agricultural producers has been described as precarious due to poor soil fertility. Although in large parts of Namibia mixed crop cultivation and livestock rearing are practiced, the soil does not benefit much from animal manure because livestock ownership is not uniformly distributed across the entire population of small-scale agricultural producers. Also, insufficient moisture availability in the very dry parts does not support fast digestion and beak up of manure so that it can be integrated into the soil. In some parts, the dried manure is collected and used as cooking fuel. Thus soil fertility largely remains low adversely affecting crop yields (Matanyaire <CitationRef CitationID="CR025">1998</CitationRef>) (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">6.1</InternalRef>).

          <Para TextBreak="No">Poor soil fertility and low crop yield is a recognized concern across the small-scale agriculture sector in Namibia which has compelled researchers to continuously search for crop options that are beneficial to all small-scale agricultural producer households including those with little or no access to manure and other fertilizers. While some households use manure to improve crop yields, maintaining soil fertility at all times has not been attained and is particularly difficult for resource poor households which have limited access to manure as well as to financial resources to procure fertilizers. Thus research that focuses on developing good practices such as intercropping, crop rotation and agro-forestry zeroing on legumes and biological nitrogen fixing species is particularly demanded in order to increase crop yields and secure food security for such households (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">6.2</InternalRef>).

          <Para TextBreak="No">However, one of the issues that require attention of researchers and extension officers alike is that of opportune planting time. Given the endemic rainfall unpredictability in Namibia, early planting is usually recommended to enable the crop to fully utilize the entire growing season to achieve physiological maturity before the onset of the dry and cold weather during May-June. It has been documented that due to uncertainty surrounding the onset of rainfall, researchers must come up with a variety of pearl millet that would mature before the onset of the dry season for late planted crop. Field research results demonstrated that the gap between genetic yield potential and the realized yield in pearl millet is primarily related to planting time and environmental stress factors which include moisture deficit during the growing period (Ipinge <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">1998a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">b</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2000</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Pearl millet (locally known as <Emphasis Type="Italic">mahangu)</Emphasis>, Namibia’s most important and dependable food crop, survives the harsh climatic conditions pertaining in the country’s dry lands stretching between Oshikoto, Ohangwena, Omusati, Oshana, Kavango and Zambezi (previously Caprivi) regions. This variety of pearl millet survives in areas that experience prolonged periods of dry weather during either the vegetative or reproductive phases. In Namibia, <Emphasis Type="Italic">mahangu</Emphasis> has proven to be more tolerant to sandy and acidic soils than other millet crops such as sorghum. It has been reported that <Emphasis Type="Italic">mahangu</Emphasis> is deep-rooted and can use residual nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium and, therefore, may not need the levels of fertility required by other millet grains (Dirkx et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">To ensure a good harvest, weed control is vital; it is particularly important to control early emerging weeds. Stink bugs and other insects also require control on developing grain heads as these bugs feeding causes small and shriveled seeds. Corn earworms, webworms, chinch bug and fall armyworms can also destroy and damage <Emphasis Type="Italic">mahangu</Emphasis> seeds. Chinch bugs can damage <Emphasis Type="Italic">mahangu</Emphasis> grain any time from the seedling stage to the soft dough stage. It is reported that damaged plants can have a drought-stressed appearance, and generalized death of lower leaves. Early infestations can cause severe stand loss and can also wither and kill plants from before flowering through grain filling (Bunting et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2007</CitationRef>). Research carried out during 2009 revealed that losses also occurred from flooding experienced during 2008 when the six regions were affected by floods that negatively affected crop yields. The flooding damaged flowering crops and swept away crop stands growing close to river bank. Greatly reduced harvests were recorded, some areas registering as much as 63 % and 67 % drop in yield (Dewey et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and national research organizations have developed open-pollinated varieties of pearl millet in eight countries in Southern Africa region. Among these, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Okashana 1 and Okashana 2</Emphasis> varieties were introduced to Namibia from Zimbabwe in 1990. Both have been widely adopted so that in 2008, they covered more than 50 % of the total pearl millet area in Namibia. Recently more productive varieties of pearl millet have been introduced, enabling farmers to increase production considerably (Manning et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2010</CitationRef>). Recent research conducted by ICRISAT in collaboration with national research organs in eight countries across the region found out that cultivars originating from the collaborative research have proven to be highly transferable across different environments. Yields increased substantially particularly where fertilizers were used to overcome low soil fertility. In Namibia, research on crop rotation to improve soil fertility was conducted using leguminous plants (lablab, Jack bean and cowpeas). Pearl millet recorded marked increase in yield particularly where pearl millet was rotated with lablab followed by Jack bean and lastly cow pea (Shiningayamwe <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2012</CitationRef>; Fleissner <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2005</CitationRef>). Improved cultivars proved to be very popular mainly due to their early maturity and drought tolerance giving high yield of between 10 % and 38 % higher than local varieties (Manning et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Elsewhere, a recent study published in August <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">2013</CitationRef> Journal of Nutrition revealed that improved pearl millet cultivars which contain more iron can provide young children with their full daily iron needs. In India and Pakistan, these new varieties of pearl millet are being conventionally bred to provide more dietary iron to rural farming communities in arid drought-prone regions where few other crops thrive. In the study, iron-deficient Indian children under the age of three who ate traditionally-prepared porridges (<Emphasis Type="Italic">sheera, uppama</Emphasis>) and flat bread (<Emphasis Type="Italic">roti</Emphasis>) made from iron-rich pearl millet flour absorbed substantially more iron than from ordinary pearl millet flour, enough to meet their physiological requirements. As an added bonus, this iron-rich pearl millet also contained more zinc, which was similarly absorbed in sufficient amounts to meet the children’s full daily zinc needs. Lack of zinc in children is linked with stunting and impaired immune response against common infections.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Iron-rich pearl millet being developed using conventional breeding by ICRISAT showed that iron-rich pearl millet variety (ICTP-8203Fe) commercialized in <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2012</CitationRef> also provides more zinc, is high yielding and is disease and drought tolerant. The bioavailability studies done in women and children show that high-iron pearl millet provides many health benefits. Thus in areas where pearl millet is the main food staple like in many parts of Namibia, results from these studies offer important strategy that can overcome rampant malnutrition and stunting inherent in the areas that rely on pearl millet. These results should encourage the production and consumption of bio-fortified pearl millet in Namibia.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Other crops that form part of bio-fortification research include cassava, maize and orange sweet potato as well as beans, wheat and rice, all crops grown in Namibia. These efforts are being undertaken by HarvestPlus which is part of CGIAR research program on agriculture for nutrition and health spread over 40 countries across the globe. CGIAR is a globe agriculture research partnership for food secure future. HarvestPlus works with public and private partners and is coordinated by International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and International Food Policy Institute (IFPRI). Thus Namibian researchers stand to gain if they seek partnership with these organizations.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Food science is uncovering new ways to improve the diets of the small-scale producers. Research on bio-fortification and breeding nutrients into crops holds great promise because it focuses on the unprocessed food staples that small-scale agricultural producers eat in large quantities every day. Bio-fortification implicitly targets its nutrient enrichment to small-scale producer households that cannot afford to purchase commercially fortified processed foods. While the technology has limits, it could give traditional African diets a major nutrition boost (UNDP <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2012</CitationRef>). Agricultural produce is the principal input into food processing industries in Namibia mainly livestock derived products such as meat products, biltong, canned beef, leather products, milk and other dairy products. From the crop products, significant processing activities include maize and wheat flour milling, packaging and baking. Many other food products such as <Emphasis Type="Italic">mahangu</Emphasis> are processed on a small scale for domestic consumption and domestic sales while only a few such as table grapes are exported (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">6.3</InternalRef>).

The second stage is the pounding of the starch component into flour (pulverizing or size reduction). The processing of flour involves a fermenting process which yields tasty white flour. Most commonly, pounding into flour and sieving the product is done twice. After the second pounding the flour is dried in the sun before it is considered ready for use in the kitchen or stored for a few days. In recent years, some industrial grain processing facilities have been introduced to hasten the processing procedure. Efforts are also being made to develop smaller scale processing using food extrusion and other methods which allow the grain to be milled, forced through a die so as to make a variety of products including breakfast cereals, puffed grains and pasta shapes.</Para>

          <Heading>Cassava and Livelihoods in Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Recent years have seen growing interest in increasing land productivity and improving nutritive value and ensuring food safety of cassava in various countries including those in Southern Africa (Tanzania, Malawi Mozambique). Since the introduction of cassava (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Manihot esculenta</Emphasis> Crantz) into Africa by Portuguese trade-merchants in the fourteenth century the crop has become increasingly popular in Southern Africa among other regions in the continent. By 2008, cassava was grown by over 31 African countries with Democratic Republic of Congo being the largest producer followed by Tanzania as the second largest cassava producer (SADC <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2009a</CitationRef>). It is widely documented that cassava is Africa’s second most important food staple, after maize, in terms of calories consumed.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In Southern Africa countries like Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawi, cassava is widely produced for food and income generation. In Tanzania cassava is grown in Eastern, Southern, Central and Lake agro-ecological zones whereas in Mozambique the crop is mainly grown in Nampula, Zambezia, Cabo Delgado and Inhambane provinces while in Malawi cassava, the second important root crop is grown in most parts of the country. It is a staple food crop for about 30 % of the 10 million people in Malawi, especially those in the five districts along the shores of lake Malawi where the soils are generally poor (Karonga, Rumphi, Nkhata Bay, Nkhotakota, and Salima). The crop ranks high among food crops in these countries owing to, among other factors, its agronomical advantages as compared to other crops. Cassava has the ability to grow in poor soils and low rainfall while giving reasonable yields compared to other crops.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In developing countries such as Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawi, persistent food and nutrition insecurity and low income are among the factors which contribute towards the prevalent poverty and poor health among small-scale agricultural producers who depend on cassava for their livelihood. It is well acknowledged that the situation is even worse among the rural resource-poor households particularly women who continue to use rudimentary arduous methods and equipment to produce and process food for their families. This is despite the fact that locally grown root crops like cassava and protein-rich legumes such as cowpeas and soybeans have high potential in improving household food security. Nutritionally, cassava is a cheap source of carbohydrates but poor protein source. Despite this situation, the improvement of cassava nutritive value and food safety through food fortification and improved processing methods had not been given serious consideration until the early part of 2000s. Cassava consumption was largely limited to its raw state, boiled, roasted or fried, with fried cassava being popular in urban areas. Despite the huge potential lying in cassava fortification, food and nutritional insecurity including severe protein malnutrition was and still is rampant in many cassava growing areas (SADC <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2009a</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Researchers in other parts of the world, particularly in Nigeria (the biggest producer of cassava in the world) had for some time embarked on enhancing the nutritional quality of cassava products through processing, especially fermentation. Prior to early 2000s, Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique cassava small-scale producers did not benefit much from cassava be it nutritionally or financially. This is attributed to poor traditional processing technologies and preservation and marketing methods (SADC <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2009a</CitationRef>). To rectify this anomaly, during the later part of 2000s, researchers working in collaboration with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and with SADC’s Food, Agriculture and Natural Resources directorate (FANR) initiated investigations into ways to address the two constraints facing food insecurity among the small-scale agricultural producers dependent on cassava. The investigations confirmed that in Tanzania and Mozambique, cassava was mostly grown on small-scale farms intercropped with leguminous crops and vegetables while in Malawi the majority of the fields were planted to a mix of cassava cultivars with no or little intercropping since the soils are much poorer and other crops perform dismally (Schöning and Mkumbira <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2007</CitationRef>). In all three countries cassava was gown as a smallholder low input crop where no fertilizers were used to add to nutrient deficits inherent in the soils.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The aim of one of the research projects conducted during 2007–2009 was to develop and promote soil fertility management technologies for increasing production in smallholder cassava-based farming systems through integrated use of nutrient resources. At the time, cassava based farming systems were faced by three major constraints i.e. low soil fertility, pests and diseases and inadequate availability of high yielding disease-free planting material. Other constraints facing the small-scale producers at the time included inadequate post harvest processing technology, low per capita production and unstable and unreliable markets.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The objective of the second project was to improve the status of rural cassava small-scale growers by protecting them from cyanide exposure that emanated from traditional methods of cassava processing and subsequently improving their health through consumption and marketing of safe and high quality cassava products. Traditional cassava processing methods in the locality where the research was carried out were deemed to be inefficient and ineffective in removing cyanogens from cassava. The methods used at the time of the research involved soaking the tubers for 5–10 days before directly sun-drying of peeled whole or peeled and split cassava roots depending on the sunshine intensity. The dried cassava tubers would then be pounded in mortars to obtain fine flour for making stiff porridge (<Emphasis Type="Italic">ugali/nsima</Emphasis>). The method leaves the root intact with little tissue disintegration that exposes large surface area to allow release of the indigenous enzyme <Emphasis Type="Italic">linamarase</Emphasis> that hydrolyses the <Emphasis Type="Italic">cyanogenic glucosides</Emphasis> in cassava particularly the bitter varieties (SADC <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2009a</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The research conducted at the time reported that during prolonged drought <Emphasis Type="Italic">cyanogenic glucosides</Emphasis> get concentrated in cassava varieties increasing the concentration of the toxic <Emphasis Type="Italic">glucosides</Emphasis> in dried cassava. During food shortages experienced during prolonged droughts, a shortened traditional cassava processing method was used that involved alternate pounding of freshly peeled bitter cassava roots followed by sun-drying and repeated pounding several times until sufficient flour is obtained the same day. During these times, cyanogens levels in cassava become highly concentrated. Therefore alternative and more efficient cassava processing methods were explored to reduce dietary cyanide exposure amongst small-scale cassava dependent communities (SADC <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2009a</CitationRef>). The research recommended soaking the tubers after peeling to improve the efficiency in cyanide reduction and that milling machines replace hand pounding. Furthermore the research recommended that waste materials be pre-treated before disposal into the environment to reduce pollution rates which were very high due to cyanogens and organic wastes being released directly into rivers and water wells.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The research revealed that lack of reliable transportation system curtailed efficient marketing of any crop surplus. Although some small-scale producers realized surpluses very few of them were involved in cassava large scale marketing mostly because transportation modes were limited to bicycles or head carting. Commonly used modes of transport were either owned or hired bicycles. Motor vehicles were only accessible to traders who transported dried cassava tubers to milling machines located in urban centers. Improved cassava processing methods were not resorted to because of poverty and lack of knowledge and cultural beliefs such as the belief that cassava processing was women’s occupation and that machine processed flour becomes light and therefore difficult to handle during cooking. Even then, many of the villagers expressed interest in attending training on available diversified usage of cassava and on how to access credit facilities and market information (SADC <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2009a</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The aim of the third research project conducted in Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique was to address issues of soil fertility, food and nutritional insecurity through improvement of processing techniques, nutritional qualities of cassava products, and diversification of products. The main goal was to explore ways of enhancing nutritional quality, safety and diversity of cassava based food products. Specifically, the project targeted two things; (i) developing novel cassava fermentation techniques that would improve the nutritional quality and safety of cassava products through protein enhancement and reduction of cyanogens levels by fine-tuning the traditional fermentation process used to detoxify the cassava and (ii) developing improved cassava based formulations and fortification techniques using soybeans and cowpeas for nutritional enhancement and diversification of products. Improvement of nutritional and safety status of cassava products was envisaged to offer significant advantages to the small-scale agricultural producers diets because animal-based proteins were too expensive for the majority of the small-scale producers in the three countries. Most diets derived their proteins from traditional vegetable sources such as beans and leafy vegetables, which are inherently low in protein content. High protein legumes such as cowpeas and soybeans were not widely consumed which partly explained the high rate of malnutrition observed during the research period.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In carrying out the projects the researchers closely involved the small-scale producers in identifying shortfalls and possible interventions which incorporated the producers’ indigenous knowledge and processing methodologies. It emerged that the producers in predominantly cassava-based farming systems were poor and faced frequent food and nutritional insecurity due to among other things poor production and processing methods. Thus focus was placed on poverty alleviation through soil fertility improvement and value addition to cassava products. To address the soil low fertility, Zinc fertilizer was added to Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) fertilizer to ensure that it does not limit plant growth. Cropping systems tested were cassava-maize-cowpea multiple cropping system; cassava-cowpea intercropping system; cassava-maize-<Emphasis Type="Italic">bambara</Emphasis> groundnut multiple intercropping and cassava-<Emphasis Type="Italic">bambara</Emphasis> groundnut intercropping systems (SADC <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2009b</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Phosphorus, potassium and zinc fertilizers were applied by broadcasting at planting. Nitrogen was applied in two splits using banding method. Half at 4 weeks after planting, and the remaining half at 4 months after planting. Second dose was applied at 2 months after planting. In the cassava + cowpea + maize cropping system, crop spacing was 1 × 1.2 m, which is 1 m between cassava plants (<Emphasis Type="Italic">kiroba</Emphasis> variety) within the cassava line and 1.2 m between cassava lines. Maize was planted between cassava lines at a spacing of 60 cm between maize plants (TMV I variety). Cowpeas (<Emphasis Type="Italic">vuli</Emphasis> variety) were planted in the cassava line between the cassava plants. In the cassava-cowpea intercropping system, crop spacing was 1 × 1 m (that is 1 m between cassava plants within the line and 1 m between cassava lines). Cowpeas were planted between cassava lines at a spacing of 30 cm between cowpea plants (<Emphasis Type="Italic">vuli</Emphasis> II variety) (SADC <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2009b</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Exchange visits were organized where individual grower groups visited individual experimental plots and assessed the different treatment performances. There were also exchange visits between groups in each other’s country. During these visits superior as well as poor treatments were noted. Discussions between the different groups were held on the impact of the treatments to the environment. The growers for example appreciated the impact of the canopy of the fully grown cassava and healthy plants which suppressed weeds and therefore saved them from weeding for the third time. In addition they noted that soil erosion and runoff were minimized as a result of the canopy.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Fertilizers application increased cassava yields significantly (P &lt; 0.05) as compared to non fertilized cassava yields. Average yields for two growing seasons showed that all tested fertilizers except N treatments gave highest yields in all plots treated with combinations of N, P, K and Zn at a rate of 40, 30, 40 and 10 respectively (SADC <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2009b</CitationRef>). High response of cassava yields to these combinations indicates that all these nutrients should be applied to get optimal crop yields from the production systems (all things being equal). It has been reported elsewhere that water stress during 1–5 months after planting cassava may reduce root tubers up to 32–60 % (SADC <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2009b</CitationRef>). Yields from non fertilized plots (Figs. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">6.4</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Fig5">6.5</InternalRef>) were much higher than those from non-fertilized fields (Figs. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">6.6</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Fig7">6.7</InternalRef>). Timely farm operations, use of improved variety (<Emphasis Type="Italic">kiroba</Emphasis>) and appropriate plant population contributed to higher yields from the trials. Generally the response of the crops to the tested fertilizers in the cropping systems was associated with soil fertility conditions, crop characteristics, adequate and distribution of rainfall during the growing seasons.

          <Para TextBreak="No">The research project introduced value addition to the cassava products. The project introduced the philosophy of processing cassava into a range of value-added products like high quality and fortified cassava flour, baked products like breads, deep fried products such as chips (<Emphasis Type="Italic">kibabu)</Emphasis> and fried products such as flat bread (<Emphasis Type="Italic">chappati)</Emphasis>. This move was achieved with full participation of the farmers who were the key stakeholders. The issue of poverty which was identified as the trunk of the tree of problems was addressed primarily by encouraging the farmers to add value to their produce during processing in order to earn more money from the cassava they produce. Appropriate agro-processing machines (i.e. the cassava chipper for producing cassava chips and the cassava grater for grating cassava into a paste) were introduced and the farmers were trained on how to use them.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In Tanzania, the problem of lack of improved planting materials was addressed by linking the farmers with the Root and Tuber section of the Kibaha Sugarcane Research Institute (KSRI) which has a national mandate to produce improved root and tuber planting materials. One prolific cassava variety (locally known as <Emphasis Type="Italic">“kiroba”</Emphasis>) was obtained from KSRI and introduced to the small-scale producers in the research area. This variety is known to be high yielding and resistant to common cassava diseases in the country. The main product that had huge market potential was the High Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF). The problem of limited market for raw cassava was addressed by encouraging the farmers to focus on sale of value-added cassava products rather than raw cassava (SADC <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2009c</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In Tanzania, cassava fortification by using soybeans was chosen because (i) soybean is nutritionally superior over other legume crops, and (ii) soybean is readily available in the country although it was not grown in the study area at the time of the research. In Mozambique, fortification employed cowpeas because they were grown locally while soybean was scarce even in large markets in Mozambique. As for cassava fermentation, in Tanzania both wet and dry fermentation were experimented with as practiced in different parts of the country, although dry fermentation was used almost exclusively in the study area. Stakeholders agreed to try both methods of fermentation because the results obtained could be used in other areas thereby making it easy to scale-out the project. In Mozambique on the other hand, cassava fermentation was of lesser significance because cassava was largely consumed in the form of <Emphasis Type="Italic">rale</Emphasis> prepared directly from fresh cassava tubers.</Para>

          <Heading>Conclusions and Recommendations</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Southern Africa is characterized by similar climatic conditions and more or less similar natural resources such as soil and land productivity. While small variations exist, the great similarities are manifested in that agriculture is the dominant sector of economic activity and employment in most countries of the region. Agriculture is the backbone of the region’s economy which employs between 70 % and 90 % of the population. Agriculture contributes more than 35 % of GDP and accounts for almost 85 % of the export earnings. Many rural communities are small-scale crop producers and animal herders depending upon agriculture for their livelihoods. Much of the small-scale agricultural production is characterized by low inputs, rudimentary agricultural implements and machinery and depends largely on rainfall. Irrigation is rarely practiced to support the small-scale farming systems.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Research investigations cited in this chapter endorse the fact that agriculture is the most important economic activity supporting the livelihoods of the majority of the small-scale producers who are largely resource-poor and that the most important crops grown are pearl millet, sorghum and cassava sometimes intercropped with legumes such as cowpeas, ground beans and maize. The research projects revealed that the major constraints limiting farmers from achieving the potential crop yields are low soil fertility, scarce rainfall, limited production resources and inadequate knowledge on soil fertility improvement options. Some social economic and cultural factors such as producers’ perception on fertilizer requirements for their most dependable crops, low household income, inaccessible markets, poor processing techniques and post-harvest crop losses influence non-employment of soil fertility improvement technologies that would increase nutritional levels and ensure food security and food safety.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Success in the small-scale agricultural sector is largely constrained by climatic and land physical characteristics as well as low labor skills. Despite the high agricultural potential of the region, often, food deficits are experienced particularly during extended dry spells that are from time to time prolonged culminating into droughts. Thus efforts are being made to address the chronic food deficits which have dogged the region for quite a while. At these times of food deficits, many small-scale producers resort to food relief and extended family support wherever feasible. Out of the many crops grown by the sector, millet and cassava have proven to be the most dependable crops that support the small-sector producers during critical periods. Thus efforts to stabilize and increase yields have been stepped up by government agriculture departments and researchers in tertiary institutions in collaboration with foreign research agencies who provide research funds and in some cases technical advice. The research findings presented in this chapter are examples of the outcome of such collaborative endeavors.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Recent research on fortification of pearl millet offers an important strategy that can overcome rampant malnutrition and stunting inherent in those areas that rely on pearl millet like northern parts of Namibia. More productive varieties of pearl millet have been introduced into the small-scale agricultural sector enabling farmers to increase production considerably. Iron-rich pearl millet is being developed using conventional breeding by the ICRISAT and it has been demonstrated that iron-rich pearl millet variety (ICTP-8203Fe) commercialized in <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2012</CitationRef> provides more zinc, is high yielding and is disease and drought tolerant. The bioavailability studies done in women and children show that high-iron pearl millet provides many health benefits. Thus these results should encourage the production and consumption of bio-fortified grains in Southern Africa as a whole.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The three research projects carried out in collaboration with FANR at the SADC Secretariat and funded by FIRCOP of France recommended the need to fortify soil fertility by applying fertilizers. From these studies the best fertilizer use combination giving the highest benefit for investment is Phosphate Rock (MPR) at a rate of 30 kg P/ha + Potassium Chloride 40 kg K/ha + Zinc 10 kg/ha for the cassava and cowpea intercrop. For sustainability it was recommended that fertilizer application should be for at least one out of two seasons. It was also recommended that small-scale producers need to be linked to input dealers and farm equipment owners. Long term plans to address the problem of poor farming equipment access and lack of inputs should include putting in place tractor hire centers within the reach of the small-scale producers as well as input stocks within or close to their settlements.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Further recommendations made include that improved processing techniques centered on food safety and value addition as well as better post harvest product management including marketing should be part of the efforts geared towards improving production in order to encourage farmers to invest on good land management, fertilizer use and environmental protection. A rectification is called for to dispel the farmers’ belief that cassava cannot be grown with fertilizer because cassava is low nutrient demander hence can be grown without application of inorganic fertilizer, and that the taste of cassava would change if fertilizer is applied. Therefore, departments of agricultural extension services need to continuously campaign to raise and strengthen awareness on the need to use fertilizer in cassava production systems.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">More recommendations made by these research studies include those on efficient and safe methods of cassava processing and preservation and raising awareness among the households on health risks posed by cassava cyanide and toxicity. Training on safe and hygienic methods of cassava processing to minimize contamination by microorganisms is called for just like ways of establishing linkages to markets which would afford small-scale producers chances to negotiate and respond to price fluctuations affecting their products. Such ways could include the establishment of farmer information centers where market information and demand of cassava products and their prices would be shared.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Further interventions recommended involve setting up more demonstration plots for improved cassava varieties in order to have seed multiplication of improved cassava varieties that are resistant to drought, pests and diseases. The value addition projects already started in the case of pearl millet and those recommended in the case of cassava require further support and strengthening. The small-scale producers should be afforded easy-terms credit facilities and assisted in acquiring business skills so as to be able to start and run their business ventures successfully and thus repay loans promptly.</Para>
