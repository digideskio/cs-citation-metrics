          <Para TextBreak="No">The position an organism occupies on the food web is called the trophic level. A food chain refers to a succession of organisms which are eating other organism and that are eaten by themselves. Trophic level is a measurement which starts from the chain and reaches up to trophic level. Food chains start at trophic level one with primary producers such as plants, then the second level is herbivores, third level is the predators and top level are the carnivores or predators at level four or five. The food web forms a single flow. Ecological communities with higher biodiversity form more complex trophic paths. Ecosystems have four basic components, namely, the abiotic environment, producers, consumers, and decomposers. Multitrophic interactions are those that involve more than two trophic levels in a food web. The term is most often applied to interactions among plants, herbivores and predators. One example of a multitrophic interaction is a trophic cascade, in which predators help to increase plant growth and prevent overgrazing by suppressing herbivores. A simple way to show more than two trophic levels can be a pyramid, which shows the flow of energy throughout an ecosystem. A food chain shows how energy moves from one organism to another organism in an ecosystem. Autotrophs make their own food from inorganic carbon and provide a food source to primary consumers. The primary consumers grow and form their own organic compounds (e.g. proteins in muscle) from the plant food that they eat. These primary consumers store energy for consumers at higher levels. Trophic levels represent the flow of energy in food chains, with losses at each level. Food webs demonstrate more complex relationships between living organisms, as one animal may have several different food sources and several different predators.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">The trophic level of an organism is the position it occupies in a food chain. The word trophic derives from the Greek τροϕή (trophē) referring to food or feeding. A food chain represents a succession of organisms that eat another organism and are, in turn, eaten themselves. The number of steps an organism is from the start of the chain is a measure of its trophic level. Food chains start at trophic level 1 with primary producers such as plants, move to herbivores at level 2, predators at level 3 and typically finish with carnivores or apex predators at level 4 or 5. The path along the chain can form either a one-way flow or a food ‘web’. Ecological communities with higher biodiversity form more complex trophic paths.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Producers (autotrophs) are plants or algae. These manufacture their own food by the process of photosynthesis and do not eat other organisms, and they are called as primary producers. The Sun’s energy is used for the manufacture of food, and thus by the process of the food chain, transfer of energy takes place from lowest to the highest level (Butz <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2002</CitationRef>). However, in deep-sea hydrothermal ecosystems, no sunlight reaches the deep sea; therefore, manufacture of food by the primary producers is through a process which is called chemosynthesis (Dover <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2000</CitationRef>).</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">There are number of food chains for almost all the organism present on the Earth, as most of the organisms are eaten by more than one kind of food or are eaten by more than one type of predator. A food web is that which overlaps or intersects food chains in an ecosystem. Decomposers are excluded from the food webs, but if they are included, they mark the end of a food chain (Lisowski et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2004</CitationRef>). Thus, food chains start with primary producers and end up with the decomposers. Decomposers recycle all the nutrients, leaving them so they can be reused by primary producers, and they are sometimes regarded as occupying their own trophic level.</Para>

            <Heading>Biomass Transfer Efficiency</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Each trophic level is related to the one below it by absorbing some of the energy it consumes, and in this way is supported by the next lower trophic level. Food chains generally show the amount of energy that moves from one feeding level to the next in a food chain. This is called an energy pyramid. The energy transferred between levels is thought to transfer in biomass, so energy pyramids can also be viewed as biomass pyramids as at higher levels biomass is consumed at lower levels (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">6.2</InternalRef>). The efficiency with which energy or biomass is transferred from one trophic level to the next is called the ecological efficiency. Consumers at each level convert on an average of only about 10% of the chemical energy in their food to their own organic tissue. For this reason, food chains rarely extend for more than 5 or 6 levels (American Heritage Science <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2005</CitationRef>).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig2">

          <Heading>Fractional Trophic Levels</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Food webs are defined as ecosystems, and the trophic levels are the position of organisms within the webs. Trophic levels are not always simple integers because organisms often feed at more than one trophic level. For example, some carnivores also eat plants, and some plants are carnivores. A large carnivore may eat both smaller carnivores and herbivores; the bobcat eats rabbits, but the mountain lion eats both bobcats and rabbits. Animals can also eat each other; the bullfrog eats crayfish and crayfish eat young bullfrogs. The feeding habits of a juvenile animal, and consequently its trophic level, can change as it grows up. The fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly sets the values of trophic levels to one in plants and detritus, two in herbivores and detritivores (primary consumers), three in secondary consumers and so on. The definition of the trophic level, TL, for any consumer species is (Pauly and Palomares <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2005</CitationRef>)<Equation ID="Equa">

Overfishing at the higher trophic levels results in higher economic values of fishes. There was a decline in level of fishes as the food web declined (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2005</CitationRef>). But scientists have discovered that there is no relation between economic value and trophic level. The mean trophic levels in catches, surveys and stock assessments have in fact declined, suggesting that fishing down the food web is not a global phenomenon (Pauly et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2000</CitationRef>).</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Since biomass transfer efficiencies are only about 10%, it follows that the rate of biological production is much greater at lower trophic levels than it is at higher levels. Fisheries catches tend to increase as the trophic levels declines. The fisheries will target species lower in the food web (Pauly et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">1998a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">b</CitationRef>). In 2000, this led Pauly and others to construct a ‘Fisheries in Balance’ index, usually called the FiB index.

The index increases if catches increase for any reason, for example, higher fish biomass or geographic expansion (Pauly and Palomares <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2005</CitationRef>). Such decreases explain the ‘backward-bending’ plots of trophic level versus catch originally observed by Pauly and others in 1998.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Ecologists study the energy economies of natural systems. Foundation species (also known as primary producers) harvest an energy source such as sunlight and turn it into biomass by fixing carbon dioxide. Organic compounds such as carbohydrates, fats and proteins are high-energy substances consumed by other organisms (primary consumers), which are in turn consumed by others. Each link in this chain of consumption is termed a trophic level. As only a fraction of the energy used by a level is converted to biomass, less energy is available at higher levels. Plants, algae and some bacteria can perform photosynthesis and combine water and carbon dioxide to make organic compounds using the Sun’s energy.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Almost all the ecosystems rely upon the Sun for energy and upon autotrophs to fix carbon and harness that energy. Only a few bacteria, such as chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria, derive energy from the breakdown of sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide around deep-sea hydrothermal vents and acid mine drainage. These organisms can utilise hydrogen sulphide in lieu of water to make organic compounds, and as the reaction between hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide is a spontaneous one, they do not need energy from sunlight. Lithotrophs can use inorganic compounds as electron donors to manufacture organic compounds or produce ATP. Sulphur-oxidising bacteria, for example, can consume hydrogen sulphide, elemental sulphur, sulphite and thiosulphate as energy sources instead of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Using sulphite oxidase, sulphur-oxidising bacteria can obtain electrons from sulphur compounds and form ATP through an electron transport chain (ETC.).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In terrestrial ecosystems, plants such as grass are the primary producers and form the first trophic level. Next are herbivores (primary consumers) that eat the grass, such as rabbits. Next are carnivores (secondary consumers) that eat the rabbits, such as a bobcat. Every time there is an exchange of energy between one trophic level to another, there is quite a significant loss due to the fundamental laws of thermodynamics. Living organisms utilise energy from their food for cellular processes, growth and development. Animals need energy to move and digest food. A high metabolism also reduces the efficiency of the energy transfer by causing more energy to be lost as heat. Less energy is lost in the body of a fish than in the body of a small mammal. Energy is also excreted in urine and faeces. Therefore, so many units of grass can only support a much smaller number of units of rabbits, who can only support a smaller group of bobcats and mountain lions. This is why trophic levels are usually portrayed as a pyramid, one that places grass on the bottom and mountain lions on top. The top is generally much smaller than the bottom, although certain factors can produce an inverted pyramid if it is a pyramid of number or biomass. A pyramid of energy (which measures the energy or kilojoules) is never inverted. Each level implies a loss of energy and efficiency and less life that can be supported by the Sun.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">There is no in-principle limit to the number of levels in a trophic system, but as only a fraction of the energy of each level can be processed by the next (about 10–20%), there are rarely more than four or five links of consumption.</Para>

Producers are generally green plants (those with chlorophyll). Autotrophs can be phototrophs (photoautotrophs) or lithotrophs (lithoautotrophs). Autotrophs are able to fix carbon dioxide and make their own organic compounds to be used for respiration and structural needs. Heterotrophs cannot fix carbon dioxide and require organic carbon for cell synthesis. Photoheterotrophs produce ATP through photophosphorylation, utilising light energy, and may not need an electron donor or acceptor. Photoheterotrophs must obtain carbon from organic compounds. Chemoheterotrophs can use either inorganic compounds (chemolithoheterotrophs) such as sulphur for energy or organic compounds (chemoorganoheterotrophs or simply organotrophs) such as carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Heterotrophs are generally consumers that feed on other organisms. Decomposers and detritivores utilise energy from wastes or dead organisms, and so complete the cycle by returning nutrients to the soil or water, and carbon dioxide to the air and water.</Para>

          </Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In the ocean, phytoplankton is usually the primary producer. Phytoplankton converts inorganic carbon into protoplasm. Phytoplankton is consumed by microscopic animals called zooplankton (these are the second level in the food chain and include larval animals, such as young fish, squid and crab/lobster), as well as adult crustaceans called copepods.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Zooplankton is consumed both by other larger predatory zooplankters and by fish (the third level in the food chain). Fish that eat zooplankton could constitute the fourth trophic level, while seals consuming the fish are the fifth. Alternatively, for example, whales may consume zooplankton directly, leading to an environment with one less trophic level. Trophic levels are very similar on land, with plants being the first trophic level, cows eating the grass being the second and humans eating the cows being the third. The amount of biomass produced for a given amount of solar energy is highest at the first level. Less biomass is produced at the second level, for some energy is lost during the conversion. The more trophic levels there are, the more energy is lost. Humans are generally primary and secondary consumers and thus represent usually second and third trophic levels. Most humans are omnivores, which means they consume both plants and animals and therefore consume from different trophic levels. Consuming a vegetarian diet would mean eating at a lower trophic level and would cause less energy to be lost.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Each species in an ecosystem is affected by the other species in that ecosystem. There are very few single prey-single predator relationships. Most prey are consumed by more than one predator, and most predators have more than one prey. Their relationships are also influenced by other environmental factors. In most cases, if one species is removed from an ecosystem, other species will most likely be affected, in ways that may ultimately lead to extinction. Biodiversity can contribute to the stability of ecosystems, due to the diversity of functional responses of community members to perturbation. From the point of view of an individual organism, this can vary with different life history characteristics. For example, when an organism can exploit a wide range of resources, a decrease in biodiversity is often less likely to impact that organism. However, for an organism that can exploit only a limited range of resources, a decrease in biodiversity is more likely to have a strong effect. Reduction of habitat, hunting and fishing of some species to extinction or near extinction and eradication of insects and pollution tend to tip the balance of biodiversity. Similarly, in situ conservation areas are needed to be maintained for a diverse and stable environment for the threatened species to thrive.</Para>

          <Heading>Multitrophic Interactions</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Multitrophic interactions are those that involve more than two trophic levels in a food web. The term is most often applied to interactions among plants, herbivores and predators. One example of a multitrophic interaction is a trophic cascade, in which predators help to increase plant growth and prevent overgrazing by suppressing herbivores. A simple way to show more than two trophic levels can be a pyramid, which shows the flow of energy throughout an ecosystem.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Ecologists collect data on trophic levels and food webs to statistically model and mathematically calculate parameters, such as those used in other kinds of network analysis, to study emergent patterns and properties shared among ecosystems. The emergent pyramidal arrangement of trophic levels with amounts of energy transfer decreasing as species become further removed from the source of production is one of several patterns that is repeated among the planets ecosystems. The size of each level in the pyramid generally represents biomass, which can be measured as the dry weight of an organism. Autotrophs may have the highest global proportion of biomass, but they are closely rivalled or surpassed by microbes.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Links in a food web illustrate direct trophic relations among species, but there are also indirect effects that can alter the abundance, distribution or biomass in the trophic levels. For example, predators eating herbivores indirectly influence the control and regulation of primary production in plants. Although the predators do not eat the plants directly, they regulate the population of herbivores that are directly linked to plant trophism. The net effect of direct and indirect relations is called trophic cascades. Trophic cascades are separated into species-level cascades, where only a subset of the food web dynamic is impacted by a change in population numbers, and community-level cascades, where a change in population numbers has a dramatic effect on the entire food web, such as the distribution of plant biomass.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">At each trophic level, net production is only a fraction of gross production because the organisms must expand energy to stay alive. The difference between gross and net production is greater for animals than for the producers—reflecting their greater act.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Much of the energy stored in net production was lost to the system firstly by decay and secondly by being carried downstream. The substantial losses in net production as energy pass from one trophic level to the next. The ratio of net production at one level to net production at the next higher level is called the conversion efficiency. Here it varied from 17% from producers to primary consumers (1,478/8,833) to 4.5% from primary to secondary consumers (67/1,478). Similar studies carried out in other ecosystems, 10% of the average conversion efficiency is from producers to primary consumers. Animal husbandry often exceeds this 10% value. For example, broilers (young chickens) can gain half a pound (227 g) of weight for every pound (454 g) of food they eat. Nonetheless, the loss of energy as it passes from producers to primary consumers explains, for example, why it costs more to buy a pound of beefsteak than a pound of corn. Conversion efficiencies from primary consumers to secondary consumers (herbivores to carnivores) tend to be much lower, averaging about 1%. In this ecosystem, all the gross production of the producers (20,810) ultimately disappeared in respiration (14,198) and downstream export and decay (6,612). So there was no storage of energy from 1 year to the next. This is typical of mature ecosystems, such as a mature forest.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Some ecosystems do store energy, for example, the slow rate of decay in bogs causes peat to accumulate (the source of the world’s coal). A young forest accumulates organic matter as the trees grow.</Para>

          <Heading>The Pyramid of Energy</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Conversions efficiencies are always much less than 100%. At each link in a food chain, a substantial portion of the Sun’s energy—originally trapped by a photosynthesising autotroph—is dissipated back to the environment (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">6.3</InternalRef>). Thus, it follows that the total amount of energy stored in the bodies of a given population is dependent on its trophic level. For example, the total amount of energy in a population of toads must necessarily be far less than that in the insects on which they feed. The insects, in turn, have only a fraction of the energy stored in the plants on which they feed. This decrease in the total available energy at each higher trophic level is called the pyramid of energy.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig3">

          <Para TextBreak="No">In some food chains, there is a fourth consumer level and, rarely, a fifth. An energy pyramid’s shape shows how the amount of useful energy that enters each level—chemical energy in the form of food—decreases as it is used by the organisms in that level. How does this happen? Cell respiration ‘burns’ food to release its energy and, in doing so, produces ATP, which carries some of the energy as well as heat, which carries the rest. ATP is then used to fuel countless life processes. The consequence is that even though a lot of energy may be taken in at any level, the energy that ends up being stored there—which is the food available to the next level—is far less. Scientists have calculated that an average of 90% of the energy entering each step of the food chain is ‘lost’ this way (although the total amount in the system remains unchanged). The consumers at the top of a food pyramid, as a group, thus have much less energy available to support them than those closer to the bottom. That is why their numbers are relatively few in most communities. Eventually, the amount of useful energy left cannot support another level. That is why energy flow is depicted in the shape of a pyramid. The energy that enters a community is ultimately lost to the living world as heat.</Para>

            <Heading>The Pyramid of Biomass</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Since all organisms are made of roughly the same organic molecules in similar proportions, a measure of their dry weight is a rough measure of the energy they contain. A census of the population, multiplied by the weight of an average individual in it, gives an estimate of the weight of the population. This is called the biomass (or standing crop). This, too, diminishes with the distance along the food chain from the autotrophs which make the organic molecules in the first place.</Para>

              <Heading>The Pyramid of Numbers</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Small animals are more numerous than larger ones. The pyramid of numbers results when a census of the populations of autotrophs, herbivores and two levels of carnivores was taken on an acre (0.4 ha) of grassland (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">6.6</InternalRef>). The pyramid arises because each species is limited in its total biomass by its trophic level. So, if the size of the individuals at a given trophic level is small, their numbers can be large and vice versa. Predators are usually larger than their prey. Occupying a higher trophic level, their biomass must be smaller. Hence, the number of individuals in the predator population is much smaller than that in the prey population. ‘Pyramid of numbers is the graphic representation of number of individuals per unit area of various trophic levels stepwise with producers forming the base and top carnivores the tip’.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The shape of the pyramid of numbers varies from ecosystem to ecosystem.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In aquatic ecosystems and herbaceous communities, autotrophs are present in large numbers per unit area (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig7">6.7</InternalRef>).
