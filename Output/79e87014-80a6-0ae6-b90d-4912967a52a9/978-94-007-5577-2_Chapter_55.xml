              <Para OutputMedium="All">We present an overview of results from an enhanced sub-grid scale approach to characterize air quality impacts of aircraft emissions at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International airport (in the U.S.) for June and July 2002 using an adaptation of CMAQ called the Advanced Modeling System for Transport, Emissions, Reactions, and Deposition of Atmospheric Matter (AMSTERDAM). Aircraft emissions during the landing and takeoff cycle (LTO) and below 3,000 m were represented as plume-in-grid (PInG) emissions using AMSTERDAM’s PInG treatment. Initial results from CMAQ-AMSTERDAM focusing on impacts from aircraft emissions to inorganic PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> and total PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> indicated aircraft increased average total PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> concentrations by up to 235 ng m<Superscript>−3</Superscript> near the airport and by 1–7 ng m<Superscript>−3</Superscript> throughout the Atlanta metro area. However, aircraft reduced concentrations by 0.5–1 ng m<Superscript>−3</Superscript> downwind of the airport, attributable to reductions in sulfate aerosol. The subgrid-scale concentrations were an order of magnitude higher than the grid-based concentrations due to aircraft. In an earlier study when aircraft emissions were modeled by CMAQ as traditional point sources within the ATL airport grid cell, we showed that modeled secondary organic aerosol (SOA) concentrations increased by 2 % due to primary organic aerosol (POA) emissions from aircraft, which provided additional surface area for SOA to partition onto. We now present results from additional modeling work performed to a) enhance organic treatment in a 1-D aerosol microphysics model used to provide engine-specific emissions parameters for CMAQ, and b) examine aircraft’s impacts on secondary organic aerosol concentrations using the volatility basis set (VBS) within CMAQ-AMSTERDAM to represent the formation and aging of organic aerosols. Parameterization for the VBS components was determined using current and ongoing field study measurements, chamber studies, and box models specific to aircraft SOA formation, which showed that non-traditional precursors of SOA (NTSOA) were a much higher contributor to aircraft-specific SOA than previously understood.</Para>

              <Para>Given the projected future growth of aircraft usage and emissions, it is critical to understand the effects of aircraft emissions on air quality. However, traditional modeling techniques simplify the representation of aircraft emissions, using a 1-dimensional source treatment. Adding additional uncertainty, the First Order Approximation 3 (FOA3) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00551">1</CitationRef>], the typical method used to estimate PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> emissions from aircraft, has known limitations, particularly in regards to POA. Here we present an investigation of the simulated impacts of aviation emissions when treated at the sub-grid scale as PInG emission sources, focusing on impacts to PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> and provide future considerations to enhance predictions of organic contributions.</Para>

              <Para>CMAQ-AMSTERDAM [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00552">2</CitationRef>] was used to estimate the effects of aircraft emissions on air quality at and around the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL). Modeling simulations were performed for June and July 2002 at a 4-km horizontal grid resolution with 19 vertical layers. Meteorological inputs were based on 2002 conditions and generated using MM5. Non-aviation emissions were estimated using the EPA’s 2002 NEI and excluded the NEI reported emissions from commercial aircraft.</Para>
              <Para>Aircraft emissions were estimated for Landing and Takeoff (LTO) cycle activity of commercial aircraft below 3,000 ft based on 2002 historical flight activity (CSSI, 2007). For each commercial aircraft engine, mode specific (taxiing, takeoff, approach and landing) LTO emission factors for total organic gases (TOG), NO<Subscript>x</Subscript>, CO, and SO<Subscript>2</Subscript> were taken from the ICAO database [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00553">3</CitationRef>]. TOG was speciated using the recommend FAA and EPA aircraft speciation profile [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00554">4</CitationRef>]. PM emission factors of elemental carbon, POA, and sulfate aerosol were estimated using the FOA3 methodology [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00551">1</CitationRef>]. Computed emission factors were applied to annual activity data to produce an annual inventory. This annual inventory was allocated in time and space using 51 PInG emitter sources (8 takeoff, 20 climbout, 20 approach, and 3 taxi) which were mapped onto 4 runways at ATL (2 designated for landing, 2 for takeoff) to represent typical takeoff and landing trajectories.</Para>
              <Para>Three additional model scenarios were performed over a 2-day period (June 6 and 7, 2002) to analyze sensitivities to varying the number of PInG emitter sources used to represent aircraft. In these three scenarios, total emissions were identical to the initial PInG scenario but the number of PInG emitter locations was increased from 51 to 102 (2×), 153 (3×), and 202 (∼4× and currently the maximum allowable within CMAQ-AMSTERDAM).</Para>

              <Para>CMAQ-AMSTERDAM results indicated that, on a 2 month average basis, aircraft emissions increased PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> concentrations by 235 ng m<Superscript>−3</Superscript>at the ATL airport when PInG was used, compared to 217 ng m<Superscript>−3</Superscript> without PInG. The PInG treatment also predicted higher contributions from aircraft emissions to PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> downwind of ATL compared to the non-PInG treatment. Differences in impacts between PInG and non-PInG greater than 2 ng typically occurred within 50-km of the airport but extended as far as 75-km downwind. In general, the higher predicted PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> contributions were attributable to inorganic PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> species.</Para>
              <Para>Examining hourly results for June 6, 2002, grid based contributions with PInG exhibited a higher average but lower range of values at the airport compared to without PInG (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00551">55.1</InternalRef>). However, the maximum subgrid scale concentrations in the puffs were an order of magnitude higher than the grid averages. Furthermore, puffs tended to have higher concentrations downwind than near the airport source, and their concentrations were higher aloft than in the surface layer (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00551">55.1</InternalRef>).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00551">

These increased contributions were similar to differences when using PInG vs. non-PInGand suggest that doubling or tripling the number of emitters enhances the impacts of using a PInG treatment for aircraft. Conversely, increasing emitters by approximately 4xloweredcontributions from aircraft emissions compared to the original PInG simulation. This is possibly attributable to an increase in the number of plumes, which are diluted and more readily merge into the grid, reducing PInG effects. It should be noted that with each increase in the number of emitter locations used (1× to 2×, 2× to 3×, etc.), model run time increased by approximately 15 %.</Para>

              <Para>This work provides a framework to model aircraft emissions as PInG sources using CMAQ-AMSTERDAM at ATL. Ongoing efforts include coupling the existing CMAQ-AMSTERDAM framework with the one-dimensional Aerosol Dynamics Simulation Code (ADSC) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00555">5</CitationRef>] model and the VBS approach [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00556">6</CitationRef>] to modeling aerosols. ADSC provides near field predictions of engine specific organic aerosol emissions for CMAQ-AMSTERDAM. The VBS portion predicts SOA formation and partitioning with aircraft specific parameterizations based on current and ongoing field study measurements [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00557">7</CitationRef>], chamber studies, and box models [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00558">8</CitationRef>]. Initial testing of the contributions of aircraft emissions to SOA using VBS in CMAQ is underway. Preliminary results using this VBS parameterization have indicated that the use of VBS increases SOA production from aircraft emissions, particularly downwind of the airport while also improving model performance for both OC and PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> at two monitoring locations near the airport.</Para>

              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Questioner Name</Emphasis>: Stefano Galmarini</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: Would your new approach/improvements be more visible if you considered an airport less busy than the Atlanta one? Preferential pathways may lead to differences that grid method would smear down.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: Yes, we agree that the grid-based approach would dilute some of these impacts due to preferential pathway changes. However, that limitation is precisely the reason we need an enhanced subgrid-scale treatment of aircraft sources to characterize their air quality impacts in the near field. We believe that our new approach for modeling aircraft emissions will likely show improvements in characterizing air quality even for less busy airports, specifically where commercial aircraft activity that have bigger engines dominate, but unlikely for small airports where most of the activity is dominated by regional jets.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Questioner Name</Emphasis>: Jeff Weil</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q1</Emphasis>. How far downstream (in space) do you go before the puff concentrations blend into the background, and do not stand out?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: Based upon this modeling application, up to 99 % of all the aircraft-related puffs are chemically active at a distance of 60 km from the airport, with a few puffs active even at a distance of 145 km, before they are “handed over” to the host grid in CMAQ, based upon physical or chemical criterion for puff maturity.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q2</Emphasis>. Do you see the 3D puff of PInG contribution when you compare with observations?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: We don’t have direct comparison of 3D puffs from aircraft with observations. However, since 21 % of all aircraft-related puffs from the Atlanta airport have at least 0.1 μg/m<Superscript>3</Superscript> PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> concentrations (mean of 0.14 μg/m<Superscript>3</Superscript>and max of 42.1 μg/m<Superscript>3</Superscript>from all puffs during the 2-month simulation), these concentrations are definitely measurable.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q3</Emphasis>. If the 3D puffs do matter, should you consider a TC0 case where you explicitly model individual aircraft plumes as “line-thermal” or 2D puffs because they would better retain their buoyancy?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: We haven’t considered that. But we will investigate this in ongoing work, which is focused on improving treatment of aircraft sources in 3-D models, and understanding subgrid-scale variability due to these sources.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Questioner Name</Emphasis>: Biliaiev N</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: From the physical point of view, there must be the interaction between puffs. I don’t see this in these results. Does your model take into account this interaction?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: Yes, CMAQ-AMSTERDAM supports both intra-plume and inter-plume interactions by treating both splitting and merging of puffs from aircraft to account for wind shear effects, and varying chemistry across the plume.</SimplePara>
