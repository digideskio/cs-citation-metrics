              <Para TextBreak="No">The theoretical basis for stress reduction in the workplace—psychosocial and physiological aspects—forms the first part of this chapter. A distinction is made between improvement of “good” forces and reduction of “evil” forces. The physiological counterparts of “good” (regeneration) and “bad” (energy mobilization) are presented. Furthermore, a distinction between organization-based and individual stress reduction programmes is made.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Several examples of intervention approaches and evaluation of their effects on employee health are presented. Many studies have shown that stress reduction programmes for the workplace can be effective in health promotion. There are many difficulties, however, that encounter the researcher who wants to do evaluation of the effects of such programmes on employee health, and these difficulties are particularly pronounced for those who evaluate organizational interventions.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">When workplace-based stress interventions are discussed in relation to employee health, a frequent assumption is that such interventions should be confined to individual stress management programmes. Such programmes have indeed proved to be fruitful when applied skilfully. Reviews of scientific evaluations of stress management programmes on employee health—including both individual and more collective organizational approaches—even point out that the benefits of individual stress management are easier to prove than are those of organizational approaches. Part of this, however, may be due to the fact that it is more difficult to scientifically examine beneficial employee health effects of an organizational stress reduction strategy than to design evaluations of an individual approach—when each individual’s health promotion is dealt with separately and each one’s health is also followed separately without reference to the group (Kristensen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001821">2005</CitationRef>). Practitioners involved in anti-stress health promotion programmes often point out, however, that beneficial effects of an individual stress management programme may turn out to have a short duration if the individual teaching it is not joined with an organizational approach at the same time. This complicates the theoretical analysis of stress reduction approaches in the workplace. As a consequence, the present review includes individual as well as organizational approaches to workplace stress prevention. Most of the organizational approaches will relate to work organization and to education of managers, factors that are crucial for the well-being of employees.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig00181">18.1</InternalRef> shows schematically the interplay between structural and individual factors in workplace stress reactions. There are three levels in the diagram—<Emphasis Type="Italic">stressors and regenerative factors, coping and stress/regeneration reactions</Emphasis>. Each level theoretically represents a level for intervention efforts. The diagram illustrates that the processes are dealing both with positive (anabolism or regeneration) and energy mobilization (stress) aspects of the interplay. The black parts represent energy mobilization and the white parts regeneration. The floating border between black and white illustrates that stressors can become anti-stressors and vice versa; that destructive patterns of coping can become constructive and that catabolic reactions could change to anabolic reactions. First I shall briefly introduce the three levels, and then discuss each one of them in more detail. What this model adds to previously published similar models is that it combines the positive and the negative aspects. For each box in the diagram, there is a positive white upper part and a negative black lower part, with a grey zone between them indicating that some factors may be protective in some situations and damaging in others.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00181">

These are positioned to the left in the diagram. Work organization is a very important prerequisite for the working individual’s stressors, but also for his/her positive reactions to the job situation. The theoretical stress chapter (see <ExternalRef>
                  <RefSource>Chap. 2</RefSource>
                  <RefTarget Address="10.1007/978-1-4614-4839-6_2" TargetType="DOI"/>
                </ExternalRef>, Cooper et al.) in this text describes the many aspects of work organization that have to be taken into account in the understanding of workplace stressors. Stressor reduction in the workplace could be based upon work with key groups, such as managers or company leadership, union representatives, or the whole organization. Most of the experience in this field points at the importance of dialogue in the application of stressor reduction, between employees and management, between work units and between different specialist groups. Moreover, most of the literature on work organization interventions is devoted to the reduction of negative stressors. An important observation, however, is that the worksite also has responsibility for creating a positive atmosphere that stimulates creativity and social support. A label for these factors could be <Emphasis Type="Italic">anti-stressors</Emphasis>. Anti-stressors are likely to stimulate regenerative “healing” and health promotion processes in the employees. This pertains to both psychosocial and bodily processes. In the diagram, stressors are black and anti-stressors white. There is a grey zone between them indicating that the border between positive and negative stressors may sometimes be floating, and that one circumstance may change from being positive to negative and vice versa.</Para>

                <Heading>Coping: The Individual Stress Management Level</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The individual programme for <Emphasis Type="Italic">coping</Emphasis> with stress is in the middle of the diagram. This level theoretically represents stress reduction aimed at changes in the attitudes and strategies for dealing with stressors in the workplace, rather than changing the stressors themselves. This type of stress management is mostly based on behavioural therapy principles (for instance, “mindfulness”, “heart math” or other similar systems for stimulating the individual to systematically analyze his/her own situation in relation to stressors). The individual’s coping programme is shaped by an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. The individual’s coping strategy, however, is subjected to continuous change. New experiences throughout life influence coping strategies, in both old as well as young subjects. Accordingly, the individual is not a static machine which has been built in the beginning of life by genes and childhood. Also, as quite old individuals, we may change our coping patterns when the environment changes. We have seen this in psychosocial intervention studies performed on elderly subjects (Arnetz, Theorell, Levi, Kallner, &amp; Eneroth, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00182">1983</CitationRef>; Lökk, Theorell, Arnetz, &amp; Eneroth, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001822">1991</CitationRef>; Wikström, Theorell, &amp; Sandström, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001839">1993</CitationRef>). These studies show that coping patterns may change also in old subjects when psychosocial intervention programmes are introduced. This also means that educational approaches could influence coping patterns. This is the basis for individual stress management.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Negative stress reactions and their positive counterpart, regenerative positive reactions, arise in an interplay between stressors and anti-stressors on one hand, and the individual coping programme on the other hand. The “interpretation” of the stressors and the subsequent handling of them (coping) is a result of genes and previous experiences. According to CATS (Cognitive Activation Theory of Stress) formulated by Ursin and Eriksen (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001837">2004</CitationRef>), the coping pattern is to a great extent formed by the expectancies that the individual has on the consequences of his/her actions. A <Emphasis Type="Italic">positive expectancy</Emphasis> of outcome is likely to be associated with an active coping pattern. According to this terminology, negative expectancies could be labelled either <Emphasis Type="Italic">helplessness</Emphasis> (actions will not help) or—even worse—<Emphasis Type="Italic">hopelessness</Emphasis> (actions will make things worse). The experiences that the individual may have had from similar situations in the past will partly determine how the interplay between stressor and coping will develop, and how the physiological and psychosocial reaction will be. An important goal in worksite-based stress management programmes is, accordingly, to increase the likelihood that an employee will have positive outcome expectancies—a way of reducing individual stress reactions. The CATS theory, however, illustrates how interwoven the three levels (stressors, coping and stress reactions) are. In order to influence outcome expectancy in employees, one probably has to work more broadly with other aspects of coping as well and, in order to sustain effects, it may be necessary to influence stressors.</Para>

                <Heading>The Stress Reaction and Its Positive Counterpart, Regeneration</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The psychophysiological background of stress reactions has been discussed elsewhere (e.g., Theorell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001832">2009</CitationRef>). One of the central parts of the stress reaction is the Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenocortical (HPA) axis, extending from the hypothalamus to the adrenal cortex (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00182">18.2</InternalRef>). If the organism interprets the situation as energy demanding, a chain of reactions starts resulting in raised blood concentration of corticosteroids. In a number of ways, these corticosteroids help the organism sustain its fight in a stressful situation. In the acute situation, this is purposeful since the release of energy is facilitated by mobilization of fuel for energy requiring actions (carbohydrates and free fatty acids), and there is retention of salt and fluid which may otherwise get lost in an uncontrollable way in a physically-demanding situation. There is also inhibition of acute inflammatory reactions. However, if the stressor is long-lasting (for instance, lasting for weeks or months), those same effects may be damaging to health. There are other components in the immediate stress reaction, some of which occur more immediately (within seconds or parts of seconds) than the reactions of the HPA system (which take place within minutes), such as those taking place in the sympatho-adrenergic system (noradrenalin) and in the sympathomedullary system (adrenalin).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00182">

                <Para TextBreak="No">There is also a “good” counterbalancing system an anti-stress system which protects from adverse effects of long lasting stress. This HPG (Hypothalamo Pituitary Gonadal) axis has the same levels as the HPA axis, ranging from the hypothalamus to the gonadal glands. The balance between the HPA and HPG axes is illustrated by Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00182">18.2</InternalRef>. The HPG axis represents the “regenerative” or “anabolic” part of metabolism. The male testes and the female ovaries are the end organs of this axis, and they represent the extremes of this activity, namely, reproduction. “Building a new human individual” is of course the most pronounced “anabolic/regenerative activity” that the body can be involved in. Building new cells and repairing worn-out tissues, is closely related to this. Some of the production of anabolic corticosteroids takes place in the adrenal cortex. Accordingly, some of the release of these regenerative hormones takes place in the adrenal cortex (for instance, testosterone in women), together with the corticosteroids that are important for energy mobilization. This means that the separation in the left and right side of Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00182">18.2</InternalRef> is theoretical and not anatomical. Cells producing hormones that are mainly active in regeneration are located in the adrenal cortex, which is mainly producing and releasing hormones that are active in energy mobilization. The diagram illustrates that the two forces, “energy mobilization” and “regeneration”, are balancing one another on all levels of the HPA and HPG axes.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In all bodily organs, cells are being worn out and have to be repaired or replaced. In some cell systems, this is a rapid process (days or weeks, such as in mucosa, skin and white blood cells) whereas, in other systems, it is slow (years, such as in the skeleton). Of particular interest in the discussion regarding effects of long lasting stress is the fact that connective tissues and muscles depend on regeneration, and otherwise there will be increasing fragility in muscles and tendons. Similarly, white blood cells have to be replaced when they are worn out. If not, increased resistance against infections may arise. A third example is the brain with its own support system, the glia cells. These cells are constructed like connective tissue cells, and they also depend on sufficient regenerative activity. It this is not sustained, the glial cells will be dysfunctional. This affects the brain function, possibly resulting for instance in deteriorating short memory function. Testosterone and oestrogen, as well as their precursor DHEA-s (dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate), are examples of corticosteroids with mainly anabolic/regenerative function. Also, other hormones participate in this, such as the pituitary growth hormone. There is a balance between the HPA axis and the HPG axis. This means that the HPG axis tends to lower its activity when the HPA axis has maximal activity (in stressful situations). But it also means that damaging effects of long lasting stress can be dampened by a high activity in the HPG axis. The balance between HPA and HPG activity is an important principle in health promotion. We are constructed for a life in “swings between the two”. We need challenges and periods with energy mobilization in order to “train” all our biological systems, but periods or energy focus have to be interspaced with periods of regeneration and recuperation. This balance theory has been developed previously by several authors. See for instance Karasek and Theorell (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001819">1990</CitationRef>). Karasek has recently published an interesting theoretical framework for the analysis of psychosocial work environments. Using the second law of thermodynamics from physics he describes the dynamic needs—in both individuals and organizations—of energy storage and energy release periods. Ideally it should be one of the responsibilities of occupational health care organizations to monitor these dynamics in the work place (Karasek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001818">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>

                </ExternalRef>, working conditions (both stressors and health promoting factors) were described. Factors that increase energy mobilization in employees include factors such as excessive demands (both physical and psychological), repeated frequent reorganizations, lack of support from superiors and co-workers, lack of possibilities to exert control, lack of reward, negative feedback and bullying (Siegrist <CitationRef CitationID="CR001840">1996</CitationRef>). All these factors could be turned into their opposites; that is to say, <Emphasis Type="Italic">reasonable challenges</Emphasis> adapted to the resources in terms of number of employees and knowledge in the organization, <Emphasis Type="Italic">well-planned reorganizations</Emphasis> rooted in the needs of the worksite activity, a good organizational structure for <Emphasis Type="Italic">employee influence</Emphasis>, social, psychological and material <Emphasis Type="Italic">reward</Emphasis> for hard work, <Emphasis Type="Italic">good emotional and instrumental support</Emphasis> from superiors and co-workers and <Emphasis Type="Italic">good emotional climate</Emphasis> preventing bullying. All of these now positive factors could, in turn: reduce the number of negative factors (stressors); strengthen the ability for the individuals and the organization to handle the stressors; and turn some of the negative biological reactions into positive ones. In addition, all of them could be influenced by organizational work. Such organizational work has been described by several researchers (e.g., Israel, Schurman, &amp; House, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001815">1989</CitationRef>; Rosskam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001830">2009</CitationRef>; Semmer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001831">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">There are several ways in which a workplace could introduce health-promoting activities in the organization. The general rule is always that there has to be dialogue between employees and management for any such intervention to have sustained effects. A reorganization that is introduced with a “top-down” perspective (with directives from management and no dialogue with employees) is likely to fail in the long run. Barbara Israel and co-workers have developed “participatory action research” (PAR) which builds upon active participation of researchers and stimulating employees to act as researchers in the dialogue between management and employees in improvement of work organization (Israel et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001815">1989</CitationRef>; for more recent discussions, see Rosskam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001830">2009</CitationRef>; Semmer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001831">2006</CitationRef>). Although not always explicitly stated, the goal in such processes is always to both identify and reduce the prevalence of destructive stressors and to identify, introduce and strengthen anti-stressors in the organization.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Although it is always preferable to work with the whole organization, it could sometimes be feasible to work with the managers in the organization—in order to convince them that they need to take psychosocial factors into account when the work organization is designed. Financial arguments are often important in such discussions. It has been shown that organizations that produce ill health in employees loses large amounts of money, much more than managers actually realize, in the form of indirect costs (see Jauregui &amp; Schnall, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001817">2009</CitationRef>). I describe two scientific evaluations of manager education effects on employee health, both of which had an explicit goal of improving working climate. From these examples, I discuss possibilities and difficulties in these types of efforts, and I also discuss the extent to which these intervention programmes have influenced stressors and anti-stressors, respectively.</Para>

                <Heading>Manager Education in the Troubled Swedish Insurance Company</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">This evaluation study (Theorell, Emdad, Arnetz, &amp; Weingarten, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001833">2001</CitationRef>) was planned during the Spring, 1998. During that period, Sweden was in the final part of a financial crisis that started in 1990. During the late 1990s, the economy had started to recuperate and unemployment rates had decreased. The crisis had started a new era in Swedish business life, however, with a high pressure for reorganization of worksites, privatization of several parts of the public sector, increased competition and lively discussions about management models. The insurance company in the study had a monopoly for a specific kind of insurances, but politicians were now demanding more competition. During the study period, no pronounced change in the company’s market conditions took place, but there was a constant discussion about such a change for the company and this created organizational anxiety. The leaders of the company argued that psychosocial education for the managers could be of benefit. For instance, one argument was that managers who have psychosocial knowledge would be more able to handle employee anxiety and, accordingly be able to prevent dysfunction in the organization during the turmoil. A consulting agency was contacted and, at the same time, a team of researchers was contacted taking responsibility for evaluation.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The manager education that was launched was founded in organizational research, and had the following structure:

                      <Para TextBreak="No">An important aspect of the design of this intervention was that all managers in this part of the organization took part in the meetings. This meant that they could support one another during the intervention year. They could discuss with one another about themes that had been discussed during the meetings. Another important aspect was that they could use the 2 weeks between the meetings for practical applications of what they had been discussing. There were four themes, each one occupying one fourth of the period, namely, <Emphasis Type="Italic">individual stress, group stress, organizational stress and ways for instituting and maintaining beneficial change.</Emphasis>

                </Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A condition for a meaningful evaluation was that there was a control group. This was a similar part of the same insurance company. The control group had similar numbers of employees and similar work tasks. Both groups were geographically located in the central part of Stockholm. The evaluation was a <Emphasis Type="Italic">quantitative</Emphasis> one, with emphasis on work environment and employee health. Standardized questionnaires were distributed, and morning blood samples (for the measurement of cortisol and liver enzymes, as well as lipids in serum) were collected before start, as well as after 1 year. There was no <Emphasis Type="Italic">qualitative</Emphasis> evaluation of the intervention programme. The researchers even deliberately avoided extensive qualitative interviewing because it was felt that this could have had an adverse effect on the course of the psychosocial process. However, interviews with the personnel management after the end of the intervention year showed that the managers in the psychosocial intervention group were more orientated towards the psychosocial needs of their employees, so some effect of the programme was clearly visible. The results from the questionnaires showed that there was a significantly more favourable development of reported decision authority in the experimental group than in the control group during the intervention year. In the control group, decision authority deteriorated, whereas in the intervention group, it improved. This significant difference in development was observed both in the managers themselves (approximately 20 in each group) and in their respective subordinates (about 100 in each group). In the examination of 260 employees who provided blood sample collections (130 in each group), morning serum cortisol remained unchanged during the study year in the control group, but decreased in the experimental group (with a significant Group  ×  Time interaction effect). Similarly, gamma glutamyl transferase (a liver enzyme sensitive to excessive alcohol consumption, but also to long-lasting negative stress) developed significantly more favourably in the experimental group. This latter finding did not correspond to any difference in development of alcohol consumption in the two groups, and the interpretation was therefore that both these changes (not only the decreased cortisol concentration) were related to decreased stress levels in the experimental group’s employees. There was also a significant decrease in serum cholesterol in both groups, a likely consequence of the blood tests and the individual information about the results in both groups. This information helped the employees focus on diet and healthy lifestyle more than before the study. Of course, the results of one single intervention study do not unequivocably prove anything, and more studies with similar designs are needed. Important characteristics in the design and interpretation were the following:

                      <Para TextBreak="No">Initiative came from management, not from the employees or union. Although the target of the intervention was the manager group, one of the specific aims of the programme was to increase managers’ awareness of the employees’ psychosocial needs. This means that, although the design could imply a top-down perspective, the contents of several lectures and group discussions aimed at an increase in bottom-up processes. Interestingly, analyses of changes in decision authority showed a favourable development in the experimental group, both in the managers themselves and in employees. Indeed, improved decision authority has been shown to be an important mediator of improved employee health in successful psychosocial job site interventions (Bond &amp; Bunce, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00184">2001</CitationRef>; Jackson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001816">1983</CitationRef>). Our results could be interpreted to mean that increased power sharing could be perceived at the same time in both managers and employees during a successful psychosocial intervention.</Para>

                      <Para TextBreak="No">The biological stress reduction following the intervention was more significant in the employees than in managers, although it is important to emphasize that the statistical power of the analyses in the managers was much smaller in the manager group due to smaller numbers.</Para>

                      <Para TextBreak="No">Stress reduction was visible after a whole year of the intervention, not before that (data not published)—no significant difference was observed after half a year.

There was no effect on work load or work tempo. The significant psychosocial effect that was observed was a more favourable development of decision authority in the intervention group than in the other group during the study year. This was associated with a reduced morning cortisol concentration which, in this relatively healthy working population, is an indication of reduced energy mobilization. The most likely interpretation is that the intervention programme had reduced the stressors by improved influence over decisions and, thereby, decreased their level of energy mobilization.</Para>

                <Heading>“Artistic Manager Education”, an Effort to Strengthen Anti-stressors</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The second evaluation study (Romanowska, Larsson, Eriksson, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001828">2011</CitationRef>; Romanowska, Larsson, &amp; Theorell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001829">2011</CitationRef>) was based upon a different educational principle than the first one. In addition, the framework was different because the participants in the study did not represent whole organizations. They came more or less randomly from many companies/agencies, and represented themselves only. Therefore, they did not enjoy the support from other managers who had taken part in the same education concomitantly. The participating managers were recruited from a larger group of managers who had applied for manager education. They were informed that they would be randomly allocated into two different groups, and that examinations (including questionnaires and blood samples) would be collected from them during the process (before start, after 1 year and after 18 months). If they did not accept these conditions before randomization had taken place, they were not recruited for the study. Accordingly, the participants had no possibility to choose between the educational groups.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The basic new educational idea of this study was that managers need training in empathy and emotional competence when they communicate with their employees. Aesthetic experiences may give important educational triggers in such a learning process and, therefore, the managers in the “artistic training” group were subjected to a collage of poems with adjacent emotionally-adapted music—Schibbolet performances. The topics in the Schibbolet performances were related to human suffering, and also related to the responsibility that human beings may have in situations that are dangerous for their colleagues. The topics were not necessarily related to work situations but, rather, to more general situations in human history (such as the holocaust). They were, however, certainly translatable into situations that managers encounter in their employee contacts (e.g., when bullying arises against an employee in a work place). There were ten Schibbolet performances during the intervention year, and the performances were always systematically followed up with group discussion (in the large group and in smaller groups) led by experts. In addition, the participating managers were asked to write diaries after each performance. Notes from the diaries were used in follow-up talks.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The educational programme in the comparison condition was similar to the programme in the previous study. Like the Schibbolet programme, it had ten meetings during a year, but the participants were asked to perform activities (“home lessons” according to CBT [cognitive behaviour therapy]) principles and not diaries as in the Schibbolet group between the sessions. The time allotted to joint activities in the educational programmes was the same for the two study groups. The comparison programme contained lectures with subsequent group discussions. There was no artistic component. In the comparison programme, the participants introduced themselves to one another and presented their own solutions to problems after listening to lectures. Thus, mutual sharing of experiences was an important component. The final study evaluation was performed on the participating managers, as well as on a group of subordinates (4 for each manager) for a total of 136 subjects. The results from the subordinates showed that the cortisol concentration changes did not differ significantly between the groups. There was a tendency (similar to the results in the first intervention study) for the cortisol concentration in the non-artistic group subordinates to decrease compared to the corresponding other group after 1 year. This was an expected finding, although it failed to reach statistical significance and the difference had decreased half a year after the end of the interventions. A positive finding was that the concentration of the anabolic hormone DHEA-s (dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate)—which is a precursor of both male and female sex hormones and which has anabolic effects on its own—developed significantly more favourably after 18 months in the Schibbolet than in the corresponding control group subordinates. The expected winter decrease in DHEA-s concentration (seasonal effect that is “normal”) was significantly less pronounced in the Schibbolet subordinates. One interpretation of this is that the changes induced by the manager intervention were able to dampen the winter deterioration in health in the subordinates—a positive “anabolic effect”.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The development of a psychosocial work environment (as assessed by standardized questionnaires) did not differ between the two employee groups. The development of mental health in the subordinates, on the other hand, had developed significantly more favourably in the Schibbolet subordinates up to the end of the study 18 months after start. Accordingly, there was a more favourable development in the Schibbolet subordinate group with regard to a total mental health score (including emotional exhaustion, sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms), covert coping (tendency not to deal with problems arising in relation to work mates and superiors) and performance-based self-esteem. This combination of findings suggest a climate increasingly allowing employees to talk about problems and solving them jointly, not only with increased individual effort. The finding that there was no significant group difference in development of the psychosocial work environment is consistent with the fact that the participating managers were not from the same organization. Accordingly, in neither of the study groups could they support one another throughout the process. Therefore, the effects of the programmes are likely to have been more individualistic manager effects than collective organizational ones. However, if the managers’ attitudes to psychosocial problems have changed, this is likely to have had an effect on the psychosocial climate. The lack of group support may have been particularly deleterious to the effects of the comparison group intervention since that intervention depends to a great extent on joint follow-up discussions of the seminars and group activities. The control group intervention was similar to the intervention in the insurance company study described above. However, in the previous study, the participating managers could support one another. If it is true that, in the more recent study, the effects of the interventions have been more individualistic, then the next question will be how the managers themselves were influenced by the two intervention programmes.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The managers were followed by means of two different psychological dimensions—“sense of coherence” according to Antonowsky, and “agreeableness” as it is assessed on the NEO-PIR. The findings indicated that there was no change in the comparison group managers, whereas the Schibbolet mangers showed an increase in both sense of coherence and agreeableness which resulted in a significant group development difference after 18 months. However, it was not significant after 12 months. This was consistent with the employee changes in health which showed no significant group differences after 12 months, but did so after 18 months. Accordingly, there was a delay in effect which is consistent with the idea that it takes time before the programme with artistic components has an observable effect on the managers, and that it then takes additional time before this becomes observable in the employees due to changes in the working climate. However, if the managers become more agreeable and feel a greater sense of coherence, they are also likely to improve their ability to handle conflicts and to realize when they have to actively deal with conflict situations rather than stay passive. In summary, the analysis of this study may show that the artistically-flavoured manager intervention has had a positive influence in the direction of health promotion, rather than on a reduction of stressors (strengthening HPG rather dampening HPA influence). The results also confirm that it may take more than a year before differences are observable.</Para>

                <Heading>Cultural Participation in Work Places</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Above, I have described an experiment indicating that a manager intervention with artistic components, if handled professionally, may have a beneficial effect on the working climate. If we extend this to the whole workplace, what do we know about the extent to which workplaces organize cultural activities for their employees? And, do such activities in general have any beneficial effect on employee health? An epidemiological survey of a random selection of more than 5,000 working Swedish men and women (SLOSH) was used in order to examine relationships between work-based cultural activities and mental employee health. The hypothesis was that we would find a positive relationship between frequent cultural activity organized at work and good employee health. The participants were asked to answer the same questions on three occasions over 2-year intervals (2006, 2008 and 2010). The average participation rate was 60%. A postal questionnaire was used to ask questions, on one hand, about cultural activities organized for employees (Are cultural activities such as movies, theatre performances, concerts or exhibitions organized for the employees in your work place? Never/some time per year/some time per month/some time per week and more often), and, on the other hand, questions about emotional exhaustion and depressive symptoms. Employee assessments of the manager function and work environment (psychological demands and decision latitude), as well as socioeconomic variables were covariates. The results indicated that only 50% of Swedish employees reported that there had been any cultural activity in their workplace during the past year. However, there was some variation during the three study years 2006, 2008 and 2010 (Fig. 18.3). A statistically significantly lower frequency of cultural activities at work was reported during the period of the highest unemployment rate of 8.5% (2010)—than during the other measurement periods—with unemployment rates varying between 6 and 6.5%. Statistically, there was a significant “protective effect” of cultural activities in relation to emotional exhaustion (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00181">18.1</InternalRef>). In 2008 (the best year in this particular study with the lowest unemployment rate), this relationship remained significant, even after statistical adjustment had been made for perceived management (Does your manager listen to you?) and two central psychosocial work environment dimensions (psychological demands and decision latitude). During the other study years, the protective effect of cultural activity on emotional exhaustion prevalence became non-significant after this statistical adjustment. The conclusion was that the relationship between cultural activity at work and likelihood of emotional exhaustion may have been partly mediated by a listening manager and a good work environment, particularly during the more problematic years of 2006 and 2010.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig0018121">

                <Para TextBreak="No">However, even in 2008, when the relationship was significant after adjustment, the introduction of these variables reduced the magnitude of the association. Formulated in other words, a listening management and a good psychosocial work environment increase the likelihood that there are cultural activities organized at work. However, during the good period, the cultural activities had an independent statistical effect in the direction of lowered likelihood of emotional exhaustion over and above the effect of the good management and good work environment. This should be regarded as an anabolic, regenerative effect of the cultural activities (see Figs. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00181">18.1</InternalRef> and 18.2 presented earlier), although this is speculative since no physiological examinations were performed in this study. No independent statistical effect of cultural activity was found during the periods with a lower cultural activity at work, although the unadjusted relationship was significant also during those years. Prospective analyses indicated that cultural activities at work had a statistically independent value for predicting beneficial change in emotional exhaustion scores 2008-2010. This indicated that cultural activity at work might sometimes protect against emotional exhaustion. It should be pointed out that most of the cultural activities that were offered were vaguely defined and, therefore, long-lasting effects may have been unlikely for most of them. For depressive symptoms, no significant relationships were observed. Depressive symptoms could be regarded as a more serious ill health outcome than emotional exhaustion, and it could therefore be that even stronger and more frequent activity levels would have been required.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Thus, the question on cultural activity at work was a vague and superficial one without specification of type of cultural activity. When the responses indicated that some activity had taken place, they may have been an indication of a social indirect “caring” emphasis in the work environment. However, most of the activities reported were infrequent. Other research (Bygren, Konlaan, &amp; Johansson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00188">1996</CitationRef> and Bygren, Johansson, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00189">2009</CitationRef>) has indicated that social activities should take place at least once a week to have an effect on health indicators (mortality), and there is no reason to assume that this would not apply to cultural activity in the workplace. Still the findings do show a “dose response pattern” with decreasing evidence of emotional exhaustion among employees with increasing cultural activity at work. That no effects lasting for as long as 2 years were shown could be explained by the low intensity and heterogeneous nature of this exposure. An important observation was that these positive activities decreased during a period of high unemployment rate and, that during that period, the effects of cultural activity were not statistical significant (after adjustment for psychological demands, decision latitude and the degree to which the manager listened or not). Perhaps the recommendation should be the opposite one: the more unemployment, the more cultural activity at work because such activities could promote both health and creativity in employees.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Very few studies have been published from interventions specifically designed to improve employee health by means of cultural activity. An experiment performed by Bygren, Weissglas, et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00187">2009</CitationRef>) was designed as a randomized control trial, in which employees in a municipality in northern Sweden were offered the possibility to participate in the experiment which comprised cultural activities once a week (the participants could select films, concerts, or art exhibition visits, or singing in a choir), lasting for 2 months. Half of the participants were randomized to the experimental group (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  51), while the other group (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  50) served as a control group. Standardized questionnaires were used before and after the intervention period. The results indicated a statistically more favourable development of vitality, social functioning and somatic health (composite score) in the experiment group than in the other group.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A subsequent study by our group (Theorell, Hartzell, &amp; Näslund, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001834">2009</CitationRef>) was performed in order to illuminate the possible significance of collective effects of cultural activities at work. There was no control group. The experiment took place in four work places in which employees had the possibility to participate in cultural activities organized at the workplace during working hours, once a week during 3 months. The activities were organized by regional groups (theatre, classical music, jazz, interactive theatre, dance, Chinese and Scottish dance, bingo lottery after art exhibition etc.). Ten participants were selected from each workplace for observations. These key participants had a high presence in the cultural activities throughout the experimental period, but the presence of other employees varied substantially and, therefore, collective effects on whole worksites could not be studied. Employees who did not belong to the observation group could attend, but did so only when other conditions at work allowed this. The subjects in the observation group were asked to fill out visual analogue scales before and after each activity Changes from before to after performance in emotional states were calculated from these scales. This allowed us to calculate the average activity related to increases in joy, relaxation, and alertness for each person during the 3 months. Participants were asked before and after the 3 months period to fill out standardized questionnaires relating to health (emotional exhaustion, depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance), and blood specimens were also collected before and after the study period. Because there was no control group, no conclusions can be drawn regarding possible effects of the cultural activities. Another complication was that the start of the study was in August, when most subjects had just come back from summer vacation, and the end was in late November with darkness, cold weather and deteriorating atmosphere at work. As a result, there was a significant worsening both in subjective well-being and in biological stress indicators that could be assessed in the blood samples in the total study group. However, those subjects who, on average, felt more than other participants that they were vitalized and became more joyful and relaxed after the cultural activities had a better health development than other participants. There was, however, also a negative result which we considered important: Those who benefited the most with regard to emotional states also reported that their social support became worse during the study period. This could be interpreted as a “jealousy” effect. Many of their work mates were not allowed to leave their work for the cultural activity. When the “beneficiaries” came back, these work mates may have been irritated and angry.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">This above “jealousy” finding raises an important point. If cultural activities in the work place should have optimal effects it is necessary to: provide a diversity of activities so that everyone can find something of interest in the cultural activity; and allow an equal possibility for everybody to participate. Otherwise, the cohesiveness effects are unlikely to arise, the social climate is not likely to improve, and the beneficial “regenerative” effects will also be unlikely.</Para>

              <Heading>Other Organizational Changes That Have Been Evaluated in Relation to the Employee Health Change Organization</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Improvement in work organization could in general have beneficial effects on employee health. In the examples produced above, specific goals were formulated, such as improved psychosocial competence in managers and increased cultural activity at work. There are, however, many other possible targets. A few examples should be mentioned.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In 1983, Orth Gomer (Orth Gomér, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001826">1983</CitationRef>) described an experiment in which 45 policemen were randomly allocated to two groups (22 and 23 subjects, respectively) with different shift work schedules. In one group, they started working in a counter clock-wise schedule (essentially condensing shifts) for 4 weeks, and then continued working in a clock-wise schedule (spreading shifts) for 4 weeks. In the other group, the order between these schedules was reversed. The number of working hours was exactly the same in the two alternatives. After clock-wise rotation, sleep was reported to be longer and systolic blood pressure and urinary catecholamine excretion became lower than after the counter clock-wise rotation. These findings indicate that an improvement in shift work scheduling is associated with improved employee health, mainly because of decreased HPA axis activity (mirrored in reduced blood pressure and catecholamine excretion). The example is interesting from another point of view. Spreading of shifts (clock-wise) had been less popular than condensing them. The reason for this was that a condensed shift work schedule allowed the policemen to have longer free periods between their shift cycles. Accordingly, from a social point of view, the health improving schedule was less popular. However, when the participants had experienced the difference and realized how the counter clock-wise schedule increased their “stress” level, many of them changed their mind. This discussion also tended to differ with age; older participants were more interested in health promotion, whereas younger participants favoured the social aspects and regarded the health aspects as less interesting.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Working with the whole organization is to be recommended whenever this is possible. A British group of researchers (Bond &amp; Bunce, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00184">2001</CitationRef>) examined how the method originally described by Israel et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001815">1989</CitationRef>)—Participation Activation Research (PAR)—affected the health of employees. Six office worksites (that all reported some problem with the work environment) were recruited. Three of them were randomly allocated to the experimental group in which PAR was applied. The other worksites served as comparison groups. These worksites had to wait for a year before they were allowed to participate in PAR. PAR takes many months. It builds upon the general idea that employees should be stimulated to examine their own work organization. Through a series of discussions and structured efforts to improve the organization, improved working climate is likely to arise. Self-rated psychological symptoms, sick leave and self-rated effectiveness were assessed before the start and after 1 year. With regard to all three measures, improvement was observed in the experimental group, and a worsened condition in the comparison group. There was a statistically significant interaction between time and group for all of them. Most of the improvement in the experimental group was shown statistically to be due to improved decision authority for the employees.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A similar experiment was performed by Orth Gomer, Eriksson, Moser, Theorell, and Fredlund (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001827">1994</CitationRef>). By means of random allocation, four office worksites were selected as the experimental group, and one worksite as the comparison group. Group discussions regarding individual stress mechanisms and organizational stress factors were instituted, and proposals for improvement were structured during 8 months. Stimulation from, and control over, work was reported to improve significantly in the experimental group, and this was paralleled by an improved serum lipid pattern in the same group. No such changes were observed in the comparison group. The other classical coronary risk factors (smoking, eating, exercise, relative weight) did not change differently in the two groups. The interpretation of these results was that there was a reduced stress level (reduced HPA activity) in the experimental group mirrored by improved serum lipids.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Improved HPG activity has also been observed after improvement of the psychosocial work environment, as described earlier in this chapter in the study of the “Schibbolet programme”. One other example is the study (Theorell, Liljeholm-Johansson, Björk, &amp; Ericson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001835">2007</CitationRef>) of two symphony orchestras that were followed every 6 months during 2 years. The psychosocial work environment was examined by means of standardized questionnaires, and physiological assessments of the musicians were made by means of saliva specimens (six tests on every test day on five occasions during the 2-year period) and 24-h ECG recordings. In one of the orchestras, the atmosphere was seriously disturbed by the fact that one of the wind blowers became unconscious during two concerts in front of the audience. He also fainted during two rehearsals during this period. This resulted in a reduced sense of social support and the mean concentration of testosterone (regenerative hormone) was very low in the musicians during this period. However, the fainting musician was treated medically. As a consequence, his fainting stopped. In addition, group therapy was arranged for the musicians. The psychosocial atmosphere improved and the saliva testosterone levels became normalized after half a year. Similar findings were found for the ECG analyses (indicating normalization of parasympathetic activity). These results show that a destroyed feeling of control and support may lower the regenerative activity (HPG) but, also, that a normalization can occur relatively rapidly if collective action is taken.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">That there is a need for increasing research efforts in the field of psychosocial manager competence and its relevance for work-family interaction is illustrated by the fact that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with the National Institutes for Health, in the United States have sponsored the Work, Family and Health Network (WFHN) to implement a workplace intervention and to evaluate the effect of this on employee health. The intervention is designed to increase supervisor and co-worker support for employees’ families and their personal lives. The intervention includes participatory work redesign activities that identify new work practices and processes that increase employees’ control over work time, while still meeting business needs. There are no results published from this research yet, but other research has indicated that this may be a fruitful area for interventions (Brough &amp; O’Driscoll, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00186">2010</CitationRef>; Kelly et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001820">2008</CitationRef>)</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Frequently, actions oriented towards improved production in general have the spin-off effect that employee health improves. Arnetz et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00182">1983</CitationRef>) have described an experiment in which staff working in a home for the elderly tenants were stimulated to participate in cultural activities. The effects of this were evaluated by means of a controlled study, with pre- and post-assessments in an experimental and a control group. During the process, the staff participated in the construction of assessment tools and in stimulating the tenants to participate in the activities. Pronounced beneficial health effects were found in the experimental group’s elderly participants. The psychosocial work environment for the staff in the two groups was followed as well. Although the number of staff was small for this kind of study (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  13 in both groups), the development of the rates of absenteeism recorded during the 6 months that the experiment lasted, and during the 3 months that followed, merits attention. The numbers developed differently in the two staff groups. The recorded absenteeism in the staff was identical at start. Whereas staff in the control group (with no particular added stimulation for the elderly during the 6 months) had increasing numbers of worker absences per tour (by approximately 50%) during the 9 months from start, the staff in the experimental group decreased absenteeism (personal communication, June 1984, see figure 5.2, page 196, Karasek &amp; Theorell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001819">1990</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Karasek and Theorell (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001819">1990</CitationRef>) have described an experiment (without a control group) in which employees in six different occupations participated in repeated explorations of their own health (blood tests, blood pressure measurements and questionnaire measures of health), and their own work environment. These assessments were performed on four occasions during a year. At the end of the experimental period, feedback of all the data collected was given at a group session for each worksite, as well as individually. In terms of discussions regarding the psychosocial work environment, the participants reported a significant increase in such discussions after, compared to before, the data collection period. Before the study, 27% of them (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  133) reported that such discussions took place whereas, after feedback, the corresponding number was 44% (Table 6.3, page 212, Karasek &amp; Theorell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001819">1990</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Participatory Action Research (PAR, see above, Rosskam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001830">2009</CitationRef>) is an organizational technique for making this happen in a structured and constructive way. Through a series of meetings, identification of strengths and difficulties, scheduled group activities, goal formulations and other collective activities for all employees, it is possible to improve the psychosocial conditions. For instance, successful improvements of health, well-being and working conditions for hotel room cleaners and bus drivers in San Francisco have been described after PAR processes (Antonio, Fisher, &amp; Rosskam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00181">2009</CitationRef>; Casey &amp; Rosskam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001810">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">As another example, long-term effects of a successful intervention on the health of Canadian health-care personnel have been described by Bourbonnais, Brisson, and Vezina (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00185">2011</CitationRef>). The intervention programme was very similar to PAR, as it is described above. The health-care settings were subjected to a work environment exploration (based upon structured telephone interviews), followed by interviews and goal-directed group meetings. For the evaluation, a quasi-experimental design with a control group was used. Assessments were made before the intervention and 3 years later. The results showed that all adverse psychosocial factors, except one, were reduced in the experimental group, and the improvement was statistically significant for 5 of 9 factors, namely, psychological demands, effort–reward imbalance, quality of work, physical load and emotional demands. In addition, all health indicators improved—2 of 5 significantly, namely, work-related stress and personal burnout. In the control hospital, decision latitude and social support deteriorated significantly during the same period. In addition, decision latitude and social support deteriorated in the control hospital. This study shows that a reduction of stressors is an achievable goal using psychosocial intervention techniques, and that the significant effects are not only temporary, but may last for 3 years.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In yet another study, physiological and psychological effects of a change from conventional assembly-line work to group-based work were evaluated (Melin, Lundberg, Söderlund, &amp; Granqvist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001824">1999</CitationRef>). A total of 36 male and 29 female assembly-line workers were examined during and after work at a car engine factory. The two ways of organizing assembly-line work were: a traditional assembly line, with fixed work stations organized as a chain and involving short repetitive work cycles; and a new and more flexible work organization, with small and autonomous groups having greater opportunity to influence the pace and content of their work. During both conditions, the workers were studied during two consecutive days of normal working and during a corresponding work-free period at home. In the flexible organization, the workers reported significantly more variation, independence and possibility to learn new skills at work. Successive self-reports of tiredness increased significantly more at the assembly line, compared to the flexible work organization. Along with this, systolic blood pressure, heart rate and epinephrine excretion increased significantly during the work shift at the assembly line, but not during work in the flexible organization. In addition, analyses of urinary catecholamine excretion revealed that subjects were able to “unwind” more rapidly after work in the flexible organization. This study showed that it is possible to influence worker health by means of flexible work redesign, resulting in reduced HPA activity.</Para>

              <Heading>Individual Stress Management</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Individual stress management refers to a number of techniques that aim to improve coping with stress. The concept “stress inoculation training” has been used. This relates to the discussion above regarding improved individual coping strategies and builds upon principles formulated in behavioural therapy (Meichenbaum, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001823">1989</CitationRef>). Several controlled evaluation studies of the effects of individual stress management programmes have been published and the field has been subjected to several reviews (see for instance Deborah, Tanigawa, &amp; Stephen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001812">2003</CitationRef>; Murphy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001825">1996</CitationRef> and Van der Klink, Blonk, Schene, &amp; van Dijk, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001838">2001</CitationRef>). Our own research group has performed a study of the employee health effects of individual stress management, 303 white collar workers in 22 units in 4 information technology and 2 media companies were randomized into an intervention and a control group (Hasson, Anderberg, Theorell, &amp; Arnetz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001813">2005</CitationRef>). Web-based tools for health promotion and stress management were introduced. These were developed for this intervention, and were building upon principles established in web-based intervention research and in cognitive behavioural therapy. All participants (in both the intervention and comparison groups) received a short web-based questionnaire for repeated monitoring of current health and stress status, a diary and information about stress and health. In addition, the participants in the intervention group were offered web-based exercises aiming at decreasing unwanted stress. These exercises included techniques for relaxation, time management, cognitive reframing and a chat. For the evaluation, a structured questionnaire with 100 “mostly” questions (most of them based upon visual analogue scales) was delivered before the start of the programme and 6 months later. Venous blood samples were collected from all participants during these data collection periods in both groups. The dropout rate was small and very similar in the two groups. At the end of the 6-month intervention period, the means in the intervention group had developed significantly better than the comparison group with regard to “ability to manage stress”, “sleep quality”, “mental energy”, “ concentration ability”, “social support” and “competence usage at work”. Correspondingly, the intervention group’s means had developed significantly better with regard to the hormone DHEA-s, Neuropeptide Y (also a protective “anti-stress” hormone) and TNF alpha (a marker of immune activity). These results were very encouraging since they pointed at beneficial effects in the form both of reduced HPA and increased HPG activity. However, when the participants were followed for an additional 6 months, all of the significant differences between intervention and comparison group participants had disappeared (partly reported in Hasson, Arnetz, Theorell, &amp; Anderberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001814">2006</CitationRef>). This illustrates the difficulty that is encountered in several evaluations of individual stress management programmes: That the effects of these programmes depend on continuous use of them for long periods of time, and that individuals may tend to attend to them initially and then abandon them. Motivation is the key concept: Individuals must have motivation to continue. Increased motivation can be facilitated if individuals themselves see that programme participation continues to be meaningful. This is only one part of the equation, however. If only a small proportion of employees have participated in the stress management programme, the surrounding employees will not have a good tolerance for the activities and may even try to prevent their colleagues from participating. On the other hand, if the majority of employees have participated and, therefore, have developed an accepting tolerance, this may increase the likelihood that structures facilitating participation will arise. Returning to Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00181">18.1</InternalRef> in this chapter, individual stress management represents interventions focused on individual coping. If such a programme is entirely individually focused and no attention is paid to work organization (stressors and anti-stressors), it is very likely that there will be no lasting effects. A poor work organization may in itself create obstacles for participation. Conversely, it could be argued that an intervention that is entirely organization-focused may lack components that motivate individuals to participate. Monitoring of the individuals’ health and their work environment raises the interest in organizational conditions. Semmer (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001831">2006</CitationRef>), in a review of job stress interventions summarizing evaluations of interventions, has concluded that “a combination of person-focused and organization-focused approaches is the most promising”.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In addition to the “real” difficulties that are encountered in interventions, both organizational and individual-focused, there are often other potential barriers that researchers encounter in such evaluations. Kristensen (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001821">2005</CitationRef>) has discussed those. Random trials are preferred in scientific evaluations. The rationale behind this is that groups should be comparable from the start. In the ideal case, participants in the groups to be followed in the evaluation should not have influence over the choice of group since this could introduce error—those who prefer one of two interventions might be more healthy/ill or more willing/reluctant to institute change than those in the comparison group. When the intervention is focused on individuals in the work place, a difficulty may also arise if participants in the two groups work at the same worksite since they might influence one another during the process. This is likely to reduce possible differences. In addition, the longer the intervention lasts, the greater risk that the groups will contaminate one another, or that they will both be contaminated by irrelevant external factors. In organizational interventions, it is preferable to randomize whole worksites rather than individuals since the intervention to be evaluated is “collective” in its nature. This could sometimes be very difficult for practical reasons. One additional difficulty, particularly in organizational interventions, is that, although those planning the intervention may have very distinct ideas about the contents of the intervention, they will have to negotiate and sometimes compromise in order to make the final product only remotely similar to the initial plans; what is being evaluated in that situation may be a tiny fraction of the ideal intervention.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Several authors have pointed out that researchers tend to focus their evaluation efforts on the effects of individual stress management programmes for employees rather than on interventions with an organizational focus. This is regrettable although it is understandable in view of the difficulties encountered in evaluating organizational interventions. In a review published in Australia Caulfield, Chang, Dollard, and Eishaug (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001811">2004</CitationRef>) summarize their findings stating: “Most interventions were individually focused, despite the preponderance of research identifying risky work environment stressors. Results suggest a paucity of published information regarding what works with occupational stress interventions in Australia”.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Interventions of a physical nature that could reduce stress in the workplace are also of interest. One example is improvement of acoustics. Blomkvist, Eriksen, Theorell, Ulrich, and Rasmanis (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00183">2005</CitationRef>) performed an evaluation of the effects of a change in ceiling tiles (one period with sound reflecting, and one period with sound absorbing tiles) in an intensive coronary care ward. The results showed that reverberation time (echo) and speech intelligibility improved significantly when sound was absorbed. Staff were asked to rate work environment factors at the start and end of each shift during a period with sound absorbing and sound reflecting ceiling, respectively. Differences in psychosocial ratings between start and end of shifts were calculated, and these differences were regarded as “accumulated effects” of the environment. In results comparing the sound reflecting and sound absorbing period revealed the following: during the afternoon shift (which is characterized by a more lively atmosphere), significant improvement in such accumulated effects were reported (lower demands and less pressure and strain; despite a higher intake of patients during the sound absorbing period). In addition, the patients rated higher scores for care quality during the sound absorbing period. This is of course not unexpected, although the magnitude of the effect was stronger than expected. When sounds reverberate in the room, many statements and instructions have to be repeated. In addition, there is increased risk of wrong-doing since signals may be misinterpreted. All of this increases the level of irritation, and psychological demands rise. Thus, an improved sound environment provides a method to decrease the HPA axis activity.</Para>

              <Heading>Summary and Conclusions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Psychosocial interventions for dealing with excessive stress levels at work could be designed either to reduce the level of stressor exposure or to strengthen the resistance against adverse reactions. Some interventions do both—they aim at reduction of negative and strengthening of positive factors at the same time. Regardless of the positive/negative framework, the target could be either the work organization or the individuals—or both. Physiological stress research has advanced our knowledge regarding the physiological and endocrinological counterparts of energy mobilization and regeneration, the bodily representatives of negative long lasting stress and anabolism respectively. The first part of this chapter summarizes the role of interventions in worksites. The physiological levels from the brain to the body periphery with competition between energy mobilization (mirrored for instance in the hypothalamo pituitary adrenocortical, HPA, axis) and regeneration/anabolism (mirrored in the hypothalamo pituitary gonadal, HPG, axis) are described since they are important in understanding change processes. In the intervention process three levels, the environment, the individual and the psychophysiological reaction are identified.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The chapter then describes several “stress prevention” projects in which health consequences for employees are evaluated. On the organizational level, a wide range of approaches have been used in many different countries—Scandinavia, USA, Canada, Great Britain, western central Europe and Australia. Organizational approaches with beneficial effects on employee stress levels include such diverse things as changes in shift work schedules, improved acoustics, reorganized assembly lines, psychosocial education of managers, cultural activities for the employees and improved employee participation in work organization planning (Participation Activation Research, PAR). Drawing on several projects from the author’s research group, details related to the execution and interpretation of evaluations are discussed.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">First of all, failure or success of an intervention in relation to employee health depends on how the intervention is presented/introduced in the organization, whether the intervention really affects a large proportion of the employees or not, whether it is relevant for employee health, whether the efforts are sufficiently sustainable and long lasting to have any health effect.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Secondly, researchers may fail to show an employee health effect although there may be such an effect. This may be due to shortcomings of the evaluation design such as too small study samples, irrelevant health measures, factors not measured that mask an effect and too short follow-up periods—if effects are delayed. In the opposite way, evaluations may present positively biased results, for instance when there is no comparison group, and when there is too short a follow up—if effects are transitory and therefore of marginal importance. Poorly planned and instituted interventions which have been designed for the benefit of employee health could even have adverse effects.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Despite all these difficulties there are several published studies which show that well planned organizational interventions aiming at reduced stress levels and/or strengthened resistance against long lasting stress do have beneficial effects on variables or relevance to employee health. This shows that there is a great potential in these kinds of interventions. Outcome variables have included various aspects of mental health assessed by means of standardized questionnaires but also physiological variables such as cortisol and regenerative hormones. There is also a growing literature on qualitative aspects of the intervention process itself. This is of central importance for practical application.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In organizational intervention research there is also a discussion regarding the level of intervention. It is preferable to work with the total organization (such as PAR, see above) but in some circumstances it is also beneficial to improve the psychosocial competence of managers. Managers who are knowledgeable in the area of the organization’s psychosocial needs are likely to be of benefit to the health of the employees.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">There is a growing literature on the benefit of individual stress management programmes. Such programmes have been proved to be of benefit to human beings wherever they are applied and workplaces are no exception. Therefore it is a good idea for workplaces to stimulate and facilitate the use of such programmes. It should be emphasized however that many evaluations of employee health effects of such programmes have been based upon short follow-up periods. And in studies using longer follow-up the effects are attenuated. Part of this may be due to the fact that employees who lack organizational support for the practice of individual stress management find it difficult to sustain practice in the workplace. The conclusion is that individual and organizational interventions mutually strengthen one another.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Directions for future research: It is evident that publications of good scientific evaluations of interventions against adverse effects of stressors in the work place are rare. There is urgent need for such studies. This review shows that stress prevention programmes in the workplace could have substantial beneficial effects. There is a great potential and more evaluation research is warranted.</Para>
