          <Para TextBreak="No">This chapter discusses the various social factors which determine human health. In the preceding chapter, the roles of some social factors in health and illness behaviour were discussed. This chapter provides an elaboration of the social determinants of health (SDH), dwelling more on how social factors interact to produce health or illness. The notion that health has a social context is traced to the father of western medicine, Hippocrates (460 <Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">BC</Emphasis>–370 <Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">BC</Emphasis>). The notion of social aetiology of health or illness is synonymous with the consideration of social factors in human health and illness. Therefore, SDH refers to the full set of social conditions and characteristics within which living and working take place, which invariably account for human health. The idea of differential social positions and conditions is summed as SDH because these factors lead to differential disease exposure and vulnerability and consequences of health conditions. The social determinants examined include gender inequality, socioeconomic status, education and health literacy, living conditions/housing, individual behaviour and lifestyle factors, employment or occupation, social alienation and discrimination, and access to health care. The crux of this chapter is the detailed explanation and provision of basic frameworks to explain how the social factors function in the determination of human health. Relevant specific situations from African contexts are provided to elaborate the points.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">This chapter will discuss the various social factors which determine human health and disease. In the preceding chapter, the roles of some social factors in health and illness behaviour were discussed. This chapter provides an elaboration of the social determinants of health<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm> observed that Hippocrates suggested the consideration of social issues in human health. Such factors play significant roles in human health, and (preventive) medicine in particular should note such significant roles. The notion of social aetiology<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Social aetiology</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> of health or illness is synonymous with the consideration of social factors<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm> in human health and illness. The social context accounts for exposure and vulnerability<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Vulnerability</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> to diseases. The roles of the social determinants are considerably important in the understanding of human health. For instance, if the world is able to ensure gender justice and improve standards of living, the disease burden will be significantly reduced<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Gender</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>
            <IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Justice</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It is possible to reduce these social determinants of health (SDH)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Social determinants of health (SDH)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> to social position in the society which affects human health. Simply, SDH refers to the full set of social conditions and characteristics within which living and working take place<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Place</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> that invariably account for human health (Tarlov <CitationRef CitationID="CR48">1996</CitationRef>; CSDH 2007)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Tarlov, A.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Social position determines social status and roles while social condition determines individual place in a social stratification system. The concepts mentioned in the preceding sentence have the prefix “social” because they are created or constructed by the society. This means that they are not static, natural, or biological. Social roles are created, allocated, and performed by individuals in various social positions in the society. Social roles are duties and obligations assigned to individuals in a specific social position within social organisations such as family (parents, children), occupation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Occupation</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> (lecturer, physician, nurse), or associations/clubs (president, secretary, or member). All of these positions are socially stratified based on power relations<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Power relations</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Social stratification is the manner in which social condition and positions are ranked in terms of power, prestige, or status and wealth.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The differential social positions and roles generate unequal opportunities and vulnerabilities in human society. Such differential opportunities reflect in education, occupation, income, and other personal attributes, which also account for inequality in health. Thus the idea of differential social positions and conditions are summed as SDH because they lead to differential disease exposure and vulnerability<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Vulnerability</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> and consequences of health conditions. Social condition may increase the possibility or probability that an individual will develop a particular illness condition because of (increased) frequency of contacts with pathogens or risk factors. For instance, a driver is more exposed to road accidents<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Accidents</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> than other occupations. This is an example of how occupational status may increase exposure to injury. The social condition also contributes to differential consequences because they account for an individual’s capability to access appropriate health care. While those with high socioeconomic status (SES)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Socioeconomic status (SES)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> living in urban African cities may have access to numerous health services, their counterparts with low SES (in rural communities or in the slum) have access to limited health services (if available at all).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">From the foregoing discussion, there is a very strong ground to discuss the roles of social factors<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Social factors</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> in health and illness. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">4.1</InternalRef> shows the conceptual framework advanced by the WHO Commission on the SDH (CSDH). The figure shows the interplay of numerous social issues that influence human health, starting from the socioeconomic and political contexts. The various governmental policies and nature of political governance determine commitment to health care development. The political context depicts the level of development of the state and how resources are allocated. This affects various social positions in the society, such as level of educational achievement and income distribution. The sociocultural norms also determine the gender<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Gender</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> framework of the society and social positions. Individual attributes (e.g., income, education, and occupation) also affect behaviours, psychosocial factors, and material circumstances, which are modified by the nature of the health care system and subsequently the distribution of health and well-being. The interplay of these issues and factors are complex.</Para>

              <Primary>Gender inequality</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is a social creation and it places people in a position which affects their health. Simply put, gender also affects the nature, severity, and exposure to health problems. Women suffer more from gender inequality and inequities, thereby putting them at a disadvantaged position. Gender constitutes a fundamental basis for discrimination in most African societies where the gender gap is still very wide. There is socially entrenched gender division of labour<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Gender division of labour</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> and power within the household. Men are usually the breadwinners and most often women are confined to the private or domestic sphere where they only engage in unpaid labour.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Gender discrimination starts from the prenatal stage due to a preference for a particular sex—most times with more <Emphasis Type="Italic">social value</Emphasis> on male children. Advanced technology makes it possible to determine a female foetus, which may be aborted. Another extreme form of gender inequality is the practice of female infanticide<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Infanticide</Primary>

              <Primary>Sen, A.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. This shows that a female child may not be given the chance to life. Women without at least a male child suffer psychological dissatisfaction and discrimination in the community. Exposure to health-damaging conditions runs throughout the life of women. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">4.1</InternalRef> shows forms of gender discrimination at different stages of a woman’s life, which are damaging to women’s health<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Primary>Socioeconomic status (SES)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is often defined as the social standing or class of an individual within or relative to a social group. Generally, three major variables (among others) account for socioeconomic status—level of income, education, and occupation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Occupation</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Level of education could determine an individual’s occupation and level of income. One of the major ways of classifying SES is to divide it into three levels: high, middle, and low SES. Those who have low SES are regarded as the poor or those living in poverty. Poverty<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Poverty</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> has significant adverse effects on human health. Poverty is often described as a state of inability to procure basic necessities of life, such as food and shelter, due to limited resources. More often, it is a lack of monetary capacity to meet human needs. One critical issue is that SES and health have a reciprocal or bi-directional relationship. Socioeconomic status affects health and vice versa. Poor households usually have poor health indicators. The level of personal income positively affects the individual’s position in the “social gradient ladder.” These individuals in the upper social gradient generally enjoy better access to health care, nutrition, and often live longer than people on the lower rungs of the ladder (SACOSS <CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2008</CitationRef>). In a similar vein, Irwin et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2006</CitationRef>, p. 749)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Irwin, A.</Primary>

Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">4.2</InternalRef> diagrammatically presents the six dimensions. The first component is poor nutrition.

              <Primary>Appleton, S.</Primary>

This can enhance better mental stability and deter unnecessary life pressures and inadequacies. Higher income also allows an individual to easily pay for health care expenditures.</Para>

This is part of self-accountability of health, a notion which depicts that individuals are also responsible for their health. Some individual factors play significant roles in smoking initiation, frequency of smoking, kind of tobacco (whether marijuana or light tobacco), and smoking cessation. For instance, marijuana smokers are more prone to drug-induced mental illness than cigarette smokers. In addition, the frequency of smoking (number of cigarettes smoked per day) is also associated with propensity to smoking-related health conditions.</Para>

Factors such as smoking, drinking, and using illicit drugs are obvious choices that individuals make that impact greatly on their health, both in the short and long term (SACOSS <CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2008</CitationRef>). The decision to use tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs is often socially and personally patterned by an individual’s dispositions and structural context. Those who manage to have proper hygiene, a balanced diet, adequate physical activities or exercise, relaxation and sleep, effective social networks or relationships, stress management, a non-violent lifestyle, and effective protective and treatment behaviours are more than likely to be of good health.</Para>

          <Heading>Employment or Occupation</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Employment or occupational status affects individual health status in a number of ways. First, unemployment could have devastating effects on health. It leads to a low income and a lack of resources to manage health care, especially in a non-socialised health care<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Socialised health care</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> system. Unemployment is strongly related to poverty<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Poverty</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> and poor living condition. As it has been previously examined, low SES has ruinous effects on health care. Additionally, a transition into unemployment from employment undermines physical health, socioeconomic and psychological well-being, and could also account for grievous effects on an individual’s health.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">As shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig5">4.5</InternalRef>, an individual’s occupation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Occupation</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is related to health because it leads to a differential income. Invariably, this leads to differential capacity and resources to manage health. This could also be the case in terms of insurance coverage or personal income to pay for health care costs. People in low-paying jobs and occupational positions often have a limited capacity to manage their health and are more vulnerable to a number of health conditions. A study found that the risk of poor health gradually decreased in relation to higher occupational positions and that in comparison to people with the highest occupational positions, people with the lowest occupational positions were more likely to suffer from depression, diabetes<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Diabetes</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, ischaemic heart disease, arthritis, muscle pain, and tension headache (Volkers <CitationRef CitationID="CR54">2007</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Volkers, A.C.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Unfortunately, a greater percentage of populations in Africa is engaged in low-occupational positions. The employment situation is worse in Africa because most of the countries do not have social security system for the unemployed or underemployed. The ravaging unemployment rate puts individuals at a high risk of poverty and restricted access to health care services.</Para>

              <Primary>Occupation</Primary>

Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig5">4.5</InternalRef> shows that job characteristics, working environment, and condition influences work-related exposure to certain diseases. For instance, Li et al.

              <Primary>Deafness</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> in the outside-traffic policemen were higher than that of the policemen working indoors. The study also found that varicosis (problem relating to the veins of the leg) was higher in those who stood for over four hours every day, with the average period of the onset of the disease being 7–8 years (Li et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR33">2008</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Li, Y.C.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Out-traffic policemen are common in Africa where there are inadequate traffic lights.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Another major issue is work-related safety. Construction workers often require personal protection such as gloves, goggles, masks, and footwear. Working on construction sites without such protective devices is highly hazardous. Such workers are also exposed to harmful substances from mixing cements and other work materials. Similarly, physicians and nurses sometimes experience accidents<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Accidents</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> in the use of surgical instruments and needles, which might result in the transmission of diseases, including HIV. This is why appropriate work organisation and safety is necessary to protect workers as part of work-related supports.</Para>

It was further observed that parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis, sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis, ascariasis, and hookworm are common among African farmers because of exposure to disease agents in soil, wastewater/sewage, dirty tools, and rudimentary housing (farm huts)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

One critical form is when people are distanced from what is meaningful and relevant to them or their livelihood. This accounts for self-estrangement, low self-esteem, powerlessness, and, in particular, experience of inequity. Some of the aforementioned alienating practices are not apparent but manifested in unconscious acts, which have been entrenched within socio-spatial domains. Discrimination itself is a social stressor, which attracts responsive trajectories in daily life and systematically reflects in institutional patterns.</Para>

            </IndexTerm>. Discrimination systematically limits the social relevance and value of an individual within social networks. Institutional discrimination creates social and structural boundaries that limit the opportunities, resources, and the standard of living of minorities. The individual then experiences heightened stress and devises personal strategies (coping styles and personal struggles) of dealing with daily experiences of social stressors.

          <Para TextBreak="No">The availability of facilities and services are important when discussing access to care. This is part of the spatial dimensions of access, which include accessibility and availability of services. This could also be termed as physical accessibility. Availability generally measures the number of services in comparison to the number of potential users of the service (Delamater et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2012</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Delamater, P.L.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. This concerns the supply of services. The idea is that health services should not be scarce (or competitive). They should be available as a basic amenity for all without discrimination or limitations. Accessibility in this sense can be measured from travel distance and time. Geographic accessibility is calculated by identifying the number of people residing more than 30 min from an acute care hospital (Delamater et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2012</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Delamater, P.L.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> or 5 km away from any health facility. Two major issues also surface: proximity to health facilities and the number of health facilities. Health facilities should be closer to the users. There is a problem of accessibility when the users have to travel more than 30 min or 5 km to access a health facility or when the location of a health facility is not accessible due to road network and related problems.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Affordability and adequacy of health care<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Secondary>of health care</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm> are also important measures or dimensions of access. Especially in poverty-ridden societies, inadequate monetary capacity is a major barrier to accessing health care. Complaints about fees and other associated costs (e.g., transportation) are usually frequent among people with low SES. If such costs are high, even where facilities are available, demand for health services may be low. Adequacy, on the other hand, deals with the organisation of health. It is important for providers to be cognisant of the peculiarities of their clients in terms of service schedules and appointments. Adequacy also has to do with the quality and level of services available. This should be adequate enough to meet the needs of the clients. In rural areas, there should be simple diagnostic tools.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Another dimension is acceptability of health care services<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Acceptability</Primary>
              <Secondary>of health care</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm>. Some personal and sociocultural barriers may affect acceptability. The systems of care need to account for the social values and norms of the community. In Muslim-dominated parts of North Africa<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>North Africa</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">12.1</InternalRef> for a map of Africa), gender concordance between caregivers and takers is often a preference. If such a social norm is not considered, health care may not be accepted by the community. In addition, to promote acceptability, it is necessary to mobilise the community and provide information that may encourage utilisation. More so, the ability of health care is part of access. This has to do with the availability of personnel: number of physicians, nurses, midwives<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Midwives</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, pharmacists, and other supportive staff. There will not be effective health care without adequate health workers. Shortage of personnel is a major problem confronting many countries, especially African countries.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">These six dimensions of access to health care are critical in the determination of the health of the population. Facilitating access is concerned with helping people to command appropriate health care resources to preserve or improve their health (Gulliford et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2002</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Gulliford, M.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Without access to health care, especially based on the six (As) dimensions, the health indicators of the community may be very poor. This is why access to health care is a fundamental determinant of health.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">So far, eight major social determinants of health have been discussed. There are other determinants of health, which include urbanisation and migration, globalisation, and health policies. All of these social conditions are fundamental in determining the health status of the community. It is therefore vital to address the social determinants of health in order to improve the health status of any population.</Para>
