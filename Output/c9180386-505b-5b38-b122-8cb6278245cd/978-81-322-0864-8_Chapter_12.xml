Microorganisms do not form a separate taxonomic group like vertebrates or angiosperms since they are only defined as creatures which are too small to be seen by the naked eye. There are however taxonomic groups like the gram-positive bacteria or the cyanobacteria that contain only microbial species. Microorganisms do not grow more rapidly than plants or animals. The predominant microorganisms in soil, sediments and surface water do not grow rapidly. They have doubling times in the order of magnitude of weeks. Therefore, there is no need to treat microorganisms differently from animals or plants, when performing ecotoxicological risk assessment. The most common way to study the effects of toxic materials on microorganisms is to monitor growth inhibition on agar medium by a viable plate count. Dilutions of natural water samples are plated on agar medium that contains different concentrations of the toxicants and the reduction in colony-forming units (CFUs) relative to control plates containing no toxicant are then observed. The plate count technique is based on the principle that each viable organism will give rise to one colony. This method is simple, economically suitable for statistical analysis and amenable to the examination of large number of water samples. Toxicity of a chemical in an aquatic environment is coupled to its chemical and biological fate. Some very toxic chemicals are innocuous to the environment because their degradation to nontoxic by-products is rapid. Biodegradation is one of the principal fates of these chemicals, and humans depend on the metabolic diversity of microbial populations to ensure that many synthetic organic materials do not accumulate in the environment.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Microbial toxins are toxins produced by microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi. Microbial toxins are important virulence determinants responsible for microbial pathogenicity and/or evasion of the host immune response. Some bacterial toxins, such as <Emphasis Type="Italic">botulinum</Emphasis> neurotoxins, are the most potent natural toxins known. However, microbial toxins also have important uses in medical science and research. Potential applications of toxin research include combating microbial virulence, the development of novel anticancer drugs and other medicines and the use of toxins as tools in neurobiology and cellular biology (Proft <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2009</CitationRef>). Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most potent natural toxins known. The family of BoNTs comprises seven antigenically distinct serotypes (Aâ€“G) that are produced by various toxigenic strains of spore-forming anaerobic <Emphasis Type="Italic">Clostridium botulinum</Emphasis>.</Para>

            <Emphasis Type="Italic">Bacterial toxin</Emphasis> is a type of toxin that is generated by bacteria (<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">â€˜bacterial toxinsâ€™ at Dorlandâ€™s Medical Dictionary</CitationRef>). They are classified as either exotoxin or endotoxin. Exotoxins are generated by the bacteria and actively secreted. Endotoxins are part of the bacteria itself. Usually, endotoxin is part of the bacterial outer membrane, and it is not released until the bacteria are killed by the immune system. The bodyâ€™s response to endotoxin can involve severe inflammation. In general, the inflammation process is usually considered beneficial to the infected host, but if the reaction is severe enough, it can lead to sepsis. Some bacterial toxins can be used in the treatment of tumours.</Para>

They act as metalloproteinases that enter peripheral cholinergic nerve terminals and cleave proteins that are crucial components of the neuroexocytosis apparatus, causing a persistent but reversible inhibition of neurotransmitter release resulting in flaccid muscle paralysis. They are the causative agent of the deadly food poisoning disease, botulism, and could pose a major biological warfare threat due to their extreme toxicity and ease of production. They also serve as powerful tools to treat an ever-expanding list of medical conditions (Kukreja and Singh <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Emphasis Type="Italic">Bacillus anthracis</Emphasis> produces two major virulence factors, a tripartite exotoxin referred to as anthrax toxin and an antiphagocytic capsule. These virulence factors mediate pathogen survival and, in the case of toxin, directly induce damage to the host. Two distinct enzymatic activities are associated with anthrax toxin, each encoded by a separate protein. The enzymatic subunits are lethal factor (LF), a zinc-dependent metalloproteinase, and oedema factor (EF), a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase. Lethal factor and EF gain access to the host cytosol by binding to and translocating through a pore formed by the shared binding subunit, protective antigen (PA). The combination of LF and PA is called lethal toxin (LT), and this toxin inactivates MAPK/ERK pathway in the host. Oedema toxin (ET), formed by the combination of EF and PA, produces high cAMP levels in host cells. Early during infection, systemic toxin levels are low and likely modulate the host immune response locally, thereby allowing establishment of infection. Late in infection, toxin concentration increases causing organ damage, vascular leakage and ultimately death of the host (Maldonado-Arocho et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>

This cleavage triggers a severe ER stress response, ultimately resulting in apoptosis. The B subunit has specificity for glycans terminating in the sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid.

            <Heading>Mycotoxins</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In agriculture, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Aspergillus</Emphasis> originally was considered a serious problem largely because of its prevalence in the biodeterioration of stored crops and as an opportunistic pathogen of field crops, particularly under high-moisture conditions. During the early 1960s, the discovery of aflatoxins associated with massive deaths of poultry, trout and other domesticated animal species worldwide raised new awareness that these fungi posed threats to food and feeds beyond their ability to rot plant materials. Research on aflatoxins led to so-called golden age of mycotoxin research during which many new fungal toxins were discovered from species of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Aspergillus</Emphasis> and other common moulds. In addition to aflatoxins, other important <Emphasis Type="Italic">Aspergillus</Emphasis> mycotoxins include ochratoxin, patulin and fumigillin. Aflatoxins are still recognised as the most important mycotoxins. They are synthesised by only a few <Emphasis Type="Italic">Aspergillus</Emphasis> species of which <Emphasis Type="Italic">A. flavus</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">A. parasiticus</Emphasis> are the most problematic. The expression of aflatoxin-related diseases is influenced by factors such as age, nutrition, sex, species and the possibility of concurrent exposure to other toxins. The main target organ in mammals is the liver so aflatoxicosis is primarily a hepatic disease. Conditions increasing the likelihood of aflatoxicosis in humans include limited availability of food, environmental conditions that favour mould growth on foodstuffs and lack of regulatory systems for aflatoxin monitoring and control (Machida and Gomi <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">
              <Emphasis Type="Italic">A. flavus</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">A. parasiticus</Emphasis> are weedy moulds that grow on a large number of substrates, particularly under high-moisture conditions. Aflatoxins have been isolated from all major cereal crops and from sources as diverse as peanut butter and marijuana. The staple commodities regularly contaminated with aflatoxins include cassava, chillies, corn, cotton seed, millet, peanuts, rice, sorghum, sunflower seeds, tree nuts, wheat and a variety of species intended for human or animal food use. When processed, aflatoxins get into the general food supply where they have been found in both pet and human foods as well as in feedstocks for agricultural animals. Aflatoxin transformation products are sometimes found in eggs, milk products and meat when animals are fed with contaminated grains (Fratamico et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Human exposure to aflatoxins is difficult to avoid because <Emphasis Type="Italic">A. flavus</Emphasis> grows aggressively in many foods at all stages of the food chain: in the field, in storage and in the home. Evidence for acute human aflatoxicosis has been reported from several underdeveloped countries such as India and Thailand. The symptoms of severe aflatoxicosis include oedema, hemorrhagic necrosis of the liver and profound lethargy. Further, aflatoxins are potent carcinogens, especially aflatoxin B1. Based on epidemiological studies done in Asia and Africa, in 1988, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, placed aflatoxin B1 on the list of human carcinogens. In developed countries, the emphasis on keeping aflatoxin out of the food chain concerns is carcinogenic potential. Strong regulatory limits (4â€“30Â ppb) have been established for many commodities (Bennett <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>

          <Heading>Aquatic Microbiology</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Bacteria in aquatic environments can be found in diverse habitats and communities. They are associated with all types of surfaces, including plants, rocks, animals, sediments, manufactured objects and plankton, and they are found in environments that have extreme physical and chemical ranges: temperatures âˆ’4 toâ€‰+50Â Â°C, salinity 0â€“1,000Â atm, pH 5.5â€“8.5 and oxidation/reduction potential (Eh)â€‰+400 to âˆ’400Â mV. The number, types and activities of these bacteria are basically dictated by their environmental setting. Concentration of organic and inorganic materials and temperature are probably the most restrictive factors controlling the growth of bacteria in aquatic habitats. Most bacteria are heterotrophs, deriving carbon and energy for growth from dead remains of plant and animal material. Dissolved organic food material from these remains is found in extremely low concentration (Î¼g/l) in aquatic habitats. Thus, aquatic bacteria are efficient scavengers. Bacterial metabolism is geared to the utilisation of small concentrations of nutrients that appear intermittently. Bacteria associated with sediment and with plant and animal surfaces are often found in greater numbers per unit area than those that are free swimming. However, overall microbial activity may not reflect this mass difference because sediment and surface bacteria cells may be packed several cell layers thick. Those on-bottom layers are shielded from available nutrients and live essentially as dormant populations. Aquatic environments have a distribution of bacterial populations in which cell numbers decrease with distance from shore and with depth. Surface slicks on lakes and bays are frequently rich in bacterial biomass and metabolic activities compared to the water immediately below. The same is true of sediment water interface, where a loose slurry of sediment may contain many of the mineralisation activities associated with the aquatic environment. Thermoclines and euphotic zones of lakes and oceans can have areas with greater bacterial numbers and sometimes greater bacterial activities.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The principal activity of bacteria is the transformation of organically bound carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, sulphur and other elements into unbound oxidised states. This process is called mineralisation and is key to nutrient cycle in aquatic system. These nutrients provide plants with the essential factors needed for growth. Thus, the microbiologists and toxicologist are concerned with the toxic materials on bacteria and the processes they mediate. If changes in mineralisation and nutrient recycling are curtailed, the functioning of the ecosystem will be dramatically affected since the two are interlinked. Domestic sewage, for example, severely affects the microflora of waters. It changes the normal pattern of mineralisation and a number of economic consequences. The massive increase in nutrients associated with sewage pollution causes algal blooms. The algae eventually die, leaving a large pool of readily degradable organic matter which the bacteria try to eliminate it through mineralisation. In heavily affected areas bacteria degradative activities become limited, and with oxygen depletion large concentrations of sulphide accumulates thus killing fish and other animals. Specific toxicants can have similar effects. Thus, it is important to assess routinely the potential impacts on aquatic bacteria and the processes they catalyse.</Para>

            <Heading>Role of Sediment Bacteria in Aquatic Ecosystems</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Sediment microorganisms are crucial for the biodegradation of organic matter and the cycling of nutrients, while these microorganisms are susceptible to toxic pollutants. The degradation of organic pollutants in aquatic ecosystems is mainly performed by bacteria. Most of the bacteria in an aquatic ecosystem are bound to sediment particles. For example, 0.1Â mm of a Dutch river sediment did contain as many bacteria as 10Â m of water. Anaerobic conditions are common at the bottoms of lakes and slow-flowing rivers because the precipitation of organic material is high when the water current is low. The activity of the bacteria at the sediment surface rapidly degrades organic compounds and thereby generates an oxygen gradient. When oxygen is depleted sulphide can be formed which has a strong influence on the partitioning of metals and the degradation of organic compounds in the sediment. The depletion of oxygen in anaerobic sediments limits the occurrence of many animals and plants. The plants and animals which do occur in anaerobic sediments are specially adapted to obtain oxygen from the surface water or from the air. The effects of pollutants on the activity of bacteria at the sediment surface have not been studied in great detail, whereas it is vital for the health of the aquatic ecosystem. For the protection of the sediment ecosystem, one needs information on the sensitivity of the microorganisms, plants and animals which are living in and on the surface of sediments. Therefore, the results of toxicity tests with microorganisms, plants and animals may be combined in order to derive sediment quality guidelines. The use of the equilibrium partitioning method may be derived from sediment quality and water quality guidelines. When there are no results of toxicity tests with microorganisms, plants or animals available, it is very difficult to derive sediment quality guidelines. In the Netherlands these guidelines are derived from aquatic toxicity data using a sediment/water partitioning coefficient. The aquatic quality guideline (expressed in lg/l) is multiplied by the partitioning coefficient (expressed in l/kg) to obtain the sediment quality guideline (expressed in lg/kg). This procedure is unreliable when there is a large variation of partitioning coefficients for a single compound. Metals often show a large variation of sediment/water partitioning coefficients that depend on many factors like pH, clay content, organic matter content, iron content, sulphur content and redox potential. In the Netherlands there are a large number of aquatic sediments with a high clay content, a low redox potential and elevated metal concentrations. When dredging of these sediments is necessary, this can be a problem because they have to be treated as polluted sediments. The question remains open at which conditions the elevated metal concentrations in these sediments really pose an ecotoxicological risk.</Para>

            <Heading>Sediment Toxicity Tests to Derive Sediment Quality Guidelines</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Sediment quality guidelines might also be derived from sediment toxicity tests with animals, plants or microorganisms that live in the sediment. The procedure would be similar to the derivation of soil quality guidelines. The concentration effect relation is summarised with a no observed effect concentration (NOEC) and an EC10 or EC50. The NOEC is the highest toxicant concentration that produces no significant difference with the control. The EC10 and EC50 are the toxicant concentrations that give 10 or 50Â % inhibition. Many processes or enzymatic reactions can be monitored in sediment samples and can be used to obtain concentration effect relations. When the EC10 values of a specific toxicant for different processes and enzymatic reactions are collected, a microbial sensitivity distribution is obtained. The lowest EC10 value of this distribution may be taken to derive a safe concentration that can be used to set a sediment quality guideline. In practice, however, it is better to statistically derive the concentration that is safe for 95Â % of the processes and enzymatic reactions. This avoids excessively low values for the compounds for which many test results are available and relatively high values for the compounds for which only a few tests are available in the literature. Since the organisms are tested together with the sediment, it is not possible to attribute differences in sensitivity to the sediment properties or the properties of the microorganisms. It is always a combination of sediment properties and properties of microorganisms that determines sensitivity. Therefore, it has been suggested that each separate test should be used independently for the setting of sediment quality guidelines instead of grouping tests with the same process or function together as if it were tests with the same species. They also suggested that no sediment type correction should be performed since the microbial species and the sediment are tested together. This makes it impossible to separate species sensitivity and the bioavailability in the sediment. A similar procedure was described to derive sediment quality guidelines from toxicity tests with sediment microorganisms. It was shown that for 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform and zinc, the quality guidelines derived from microbial toxicity tests in sediment were orders of magnitude lower than the quality guidelines derived from aquatic toxicity tests using the equilibrium partitioning method. For zinc this might be attributed to a high sensitivity of microbial toxicity tests or to uncertainties in the equilibrium partitioning constant. For 1,2-dichloroethane and chloroform this was caused by the high sensitivity of the anaerobic microbial processes.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Sediments contain clay particles, organic matter, iron oxides, sulphides and other compounds that can bind the toxicant and mitigate toxicity. The toxicity depends also on the pH and the presence of dissolved inorganic and organic compounds. This mitigation also occurs in soils. For the setting of the Dutch soil quality guidelines however, the soil pH is not taken into account although it has a pronounced influence on the toxicity of metals. The situation in sediments is even more complicated since also the amount of sulphide and the redox potential play an important role. These factors make it difficult to compare the toxicity of a compound in different sediments. Therefore, a scientifically underpinned sediment type correction will be difficult to obtain.</Para>

            <Heading>The Conditions in Unpolluted Anaerobic Sediments Can Be Toxic for Aerobic Organisms</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">While the presence of sediments can decrease toxic effects of pollutants, some of the naturally occurring compounds in anaerobic sediments can cause inhibitory effects. Animals and plants need oxygen for their metabolism that is obtained from the water or in the case of plants even from the air. The low oxygen concentrations and high sulphur and ammonia concentrations which naturally occur at the surface of anaerobic sediments can be inhibitory for plants or animals. The microorganisms that live in anaerobic sediments are well adapted to these concentrations. In some cases these microorganisms are so well adapted to anaerobic conditions that they are not able to survive in the presence of molecular oxygen. This illustrates the general principle that toxicity is not a substance property only but it is the combination of the substance, the organisms, the conditions and the exposure duration that can cause toxic effects.</Para>

            <Heading>The Use of Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) for the determination of sediment quality guidelines PICT can be caused by the following chain of events: The organisms in polluted sediments are exposed to elevated concentrations of pollutants. When the pollution exceeds a critical level, the most sensitive organisms become inhibited by toxic effects. This causes a decreased fitness in these organisms which can then be outcompeted by other more tolerant organisms. Therefore, the absence of sensitive species can be used as an indicator for the toxic effects of a certain pollutant. The occurrence of PICT is often accompanied by a loss of species diversity. The tolerance of the organisms extracted from the sediment is measured under controlled laboratory conditions without sediment and is commonly expressed as the EC50 (in mg/l). For the comparison of the tolerance of the organisms, it is necessary to separate the organisms from the sediment in order to distinguish microbial tolerance from sorption to the sediment. The difference in tolerance between the microorganisms from a control site and a polluted site can give information about the percentage of the original microflora that has been affected at the polluted site.</Para>

            <Heading>A Separate Approach for Microbial Toxicity Tests Necessary for Ecotoxicological Risk Assessment of Polluted Sediments</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Microorganisms do not form a separate taxonomic group like vertebrates or angiosperms since they are only defined as creatures which are too small to be seen by the naked eye. There are, however, taxonomic groups like the gram-positive bacteria or the cyanobacteria that contain only microbial species. Microorganisms do not grow more rapidly than plants or animals. The predominant microorganisms in soil, sediments and surface water do not grow rapidly. They have doubling times in the order of magnitude of weeks. Therefore, there is no need to treat microorganisms differently from animals or plants, when performing ecotoxicological risk assessment. Accordingly, the microbial tests with <Emphasis Type="Italic">Vibrio fischeri</Emphasis> or single species of algae were used together with the tests with fish or invertebrates to derive quality guidelines for aquatic ecosystems. There is however a large number of microbial toxicity tests which focus on the functions and processes that these microorganisms support. These tests are quite different from single-species tests and are therefore treated in a separate way. These functional tests are often combined to form a sensitivity distribution which is different from the sensitivity distribution of single-species tests. This functional sensitivity distribution is subsequently used in a risk assessment which leads to a separate ecotoxicological risk level for microbial functions. Subsequently, the lowest risk level of either the single-species tests or the functional tests is used to determine the ecotoxicological quality guidelines.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Population growth is relatively easy to measure in the laboratory. It can be studied in natural mixed populations, synthetic gnotobiotic populations or pure cultures. Some researchers consider that pure cultures are preferable for toxicity studies in certain situations; others think that mixed populations should be studied. Growth studies are generally simple and can employ a variety of experimental conditions related to specific physical and chemical conditions related to aquatic environments. Microbial populations spanning a range of physiological conditions and ecosystem types are easily accessible. Samples of sediments, soil, water, plants and other materials can be transported to the laboratory. With little additional effort, growth of microbial populations can be observed under laboratory conditions, and the effect of toxicant can be measured. Thus, initial estimates of toxicity involve growth studies.</Para>

          <Heading>Enumeration of Bacteria in Aquatic Environments</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">To perform toxicity studies on bacteria, it is necessary to be able to enumerate the bacteria in a specific population from a specific habitat and qualitatively measure metabolic activity. Due to their size, bacteria present unique problems that may make toxicity studies difficult to interpret. For example, live bacterial cells are commonly enumerated by spreading a dilute water sample on an agar medium that will support growth. If individual cells are separated from their neighbours, they will grow and divide, eventually producing a visible colony. The number of colonies equals the number of bacteria present in the diluted water sample. This is a mechanically simple exercise, but the interpretation is confusing. First, there is no guarantee that cells may have originated from a single cell. It may have aggregated during or prior to plating. If the toxicant provoked aggregation, the result would seem to be reduction in cell numbers and an apparent toxicant-mediated mortality. Second, a toxicant may have bacteriostatic effect so that once it is washed away, the effect disappears. Enumeration techniques involving agar often ensure a constant concentration of toxicant, resulting in a misleading reduction in numbers not seen in nature. Thirdly, the agar medium should allow growth of all bacteria in the water sample. In most situations, however, only a small percentage of the total bacteria in the sample will grow on particular medium. With the diversity of metabolic types in natural bacterial populations, it is virtually impossible for all types to grow on a single type of medium. Thus, in a toxicity test, one never knows whether the bacteria that did not grow on a particular medium were more sensitive to the toxicant. An alternative to counting viable cells on agar is counting bacteria directly with microscope. This technique has been improved with the advent of epifluorescence counting (Daley and Hobie <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">1975</CitationRef>). Cells are stained with acridine orange, a fluorescing dye that associates tightly with DNA and can be observed under a fluorescence microscope. The bacteria stand out vividly from the background, and all bacteria in sample can easily be counted. However, many bacterial cells can remain intact even though functionally dead. Consequently, it is difficult. Several variations on the epifluorescence technique have been used to differentiate live from dead bacteria. Nalidixic acid, for example, interferes with RNA synthesis in growing cells, causing them to enlarge and change shape; this allows live bacteria to be distinguished morphologically from dead cells (Orndroff and Colwell <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">1980</CitationRef>). This technique may prove useful in toxicity tests with bacteria.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Direct counts invariably yield higher numbers of cells per unit volume than do plate counts, because dead cells and metabolically dormant cells are all counted together. However, direct counting has advantages, particularly in relation to microbial activity measures. Several other methods for enumerating bacteria are also available, but their application to toxicity testing is limited. Bacterial growth in broth media causes increased turbidity which can be quantitated with a spectrophotometer. The turbidometric method has been extensively used in microbiology, particularly with pure cultures. It is a very simple, reproducible technique. The classical multiphase growth response of bacterial cultures, logarithmic growth phase, stationary phase and depth phase can be routinely assessed. This technique is also valuable when studying the phases of growth that are most sensitive to a toxicant. However, growth phases are essentially a laboratory artefact; caution is required in extrapolating the results of the field.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Several biochemical components of bacterial cells can be quantitated and related to cell numbers. Measurements of cellular ATP levels, cell wall components such as lipopolysaccharide or muramic acid, lipid phosphate and other lipid components, nuclear material such as DNA and RNA and certain enzyme levels have been used with moderate success. In most cases, except for muramic acid and lipopolysaccharide, the measurements are not unique to bacteria. The presence of one algal cell or protozoan can greatly affect the concentration of these components and produce very misleading estimates of bacterial population densities. Muramic acid, which is found in the cell walls of cyanobacteria, often gives misleading information, since many cyanobacterial cells are considerably larger than most bacteria.</Para>

          <Heading>Growth of Heterotrophic Microorganisms</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In the last decade, a couple of successful industrial heterotrophic microalgal productions have been established. Many microalgae can assimilate organic substances to cover variable part of their carbon and energy requirements. To cover their entire energy requirements and be able to grow in complete darkness, the organic substances are respired in mitochondria with oxygen as electron acceptor, a process similar to the respiration in animal cells. Some algae, such as <Emphasis Type="Italic">Chlamydomonas</Emphasis>, may also use a slightly modified process to respire acetate, the so-called glyoxylate pathway. In <Emphasis Type="Italic">Chlamydomonas</Emphasis> the process is regulated so that it takes place only in the dark.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">
            <Emphasis Type="Italic">Chlamydomonas</Emphasis> is also able to ferment starch, which was produced during the day, into ethanol under anaerobic conditions. So far, fermentation has been demonstrated only in a few microalgae species. Algae capable of growing in the dark are called true heterotrophs, while algae that require light but are able to supplement the metabolism with organic substances are called mixotrophs. Very few species, however, can grow in darkness in addition being able to grow also as true autotrophsâ€”that is, in light without organic supplements.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Organic substances that may be respired include glucose, acetate, glycerol, TCA cycle intermediates and a number of amino acids. Only glucose, acetate and glycerol may play a role as substrates in industrial productions. These substances are small molecules, and algae are not normally able to metabolise large molecules such as proteins or even complex particlesâ€”but some algae, most notably in the classes Dinophyceae and Prymnesiophyceae, are able to engulf large molecules and particles in a process called pinocytosis or phagocytosis, depending on the size of particles.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Some dinophyceans have lost their ability to form chloroplasts but are able to retain functional chloroplast from ingested algae. A good place to look for heterotrophic species is among decaying seaweed where the decomposition processes result in a rich variety of dissolved organic substances.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The most common way to study the effects of toxic materials on microorganisms is to monitor growth inhibition on agar medium by a viable plate count. Dilutions of natural water samples are plated on agar medium that contains different concentrations of the toxicants, and the reduction in colony-forming units (CFUs) relative to control plates containing no toxicant are then observed. The plate count technique is based on the principle that each viable organism will give rise to one colony. This method is simple, economically suitable for statistical analysis and amenable to the examination of large number of water samples.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">An example of this type of study is work on the toxicity of Kepone to estuarine microorganism (Mahaffey et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">1982</CitationRef>; Bourquin et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">1978</CitationRef>). Kepone is an organochlorine pesticide which contaminated the James River estuary in Virginia. To determine its toxicity to microorganisms, samples of estuarine water from several sampling sites around Pensacola, Florida, were serially diluted and plated on Zobellâ€™s agar containing Kepone concentrations of 0.1â€“2.0Â mg/l (ppm). A significant reduction in CFU relative to control plates was detected on plates containing 0.2Â mg/l. Twenty-three different colonies were selected from these plates and developed as pure microbial cultures. These isolates were found to be sensitive to Kepone to varying degrees, but gram-negative isolates were generally least sensitive to these pesticides. Since Kepone in the James River is primarily found in the sediments, it was important to determine whether the anaerobic organisms found primarily in estuarine sediments were also affected by Kepone. Kepone was not nearly as toxic to anaerobically grown microorganisms. This difference is probably due to interference of Kepone with oxidation and respiration, similar to the mechanism described by Widdus et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">1971</CitationRef>) and Trudgill et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">1971</CitationRef>) for the toxicity of chlordane to Bacillus sp. Orndroff and Colwell (<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">1980</CitationRef>) compared the viable plate counting technique with direct counting methods. The acridine orange epifluorescence method developed by Daley and Hobie (<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">1975</CitationRef>) was used for direct counts of bacterial populations. In this method, acridine orange stains biological material gives a distinct green colour under fluorescence microscope. To obtain an indication of the number of live bacteria comprising total direct count, Orndoff treated the cells with nalidixic acid by the method of Kogure (<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">1979</CitationRef>). Nalidixic acid specifically inhibits RNA synthesis in live gram-negative cells and causes a change in their shape, enabling them to be distinguished from dead cells. Since most aquatic microorganisms are gram-negative and Kepone is not toxic to gram-negatives, use of the Kogure technique is justified.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In all these studies it is important to perform a statistical analysis on the data to determine whether effects resulting from a toxicant exposure are significant. Several statistical analyses can be used for this purpose. For example, in the work by Mahaffey et al.

          <Heading>Geochemical Cycling: Nitrogen</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In geography and Earth science, a biogeochemical cycle or substance turnover or cycling of substances is a pathway by which a chemical element or molecule moves through both biotic (biosphere) and abiotic (lithosphere, atmosphere and hydrosphere) compartments of Earth. A cycle is a series of change which comes back to the starting point and which can be repeated. The term â€˜biogeochemicalâ€™ tells us that biological, geological and chemical factors are all involved. On the other hand the circulation of chemical nutrients like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium and water through the biological and physical world are known as biogeochemical cycle. In effect, the element is recycled, although in some cycles there may be places (called reservoirs) where the element is accumulated or held for a long period of time (such as an ocean or lake for water). Water, for example, is always recycled through the water cycle. The water undergoes evaporation, condensation and precipitation, falling back to Earth clean and fresh. Elements, chemical compounds and other forms of matter are passed from one organism to another and from one part of the biosphere to another through the biogeochemical cycles. Ecological systems (ecosystems) have many biogeochemical cycles operating as a part of the system, for example, the water cycle, the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. All chemical elements occurring in organisms are part of biogeochemical cycles. In addition to being a part of living organisms, these chemical elements also cycle through abiotic factors of ecosystems such as water (hydrosphere), land (lithosphere) and/or the air (atmosphere).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The living factors of the planet can be referred to collectively as the biosphere. All the nutrientsâ€”such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphurâ€”used in ecosystems by living organisms are a part of a closed system; therefore, these chemicals are recycled instead of being lost and replenished constantly such as in an open system. The flow of energy in an ecosystem is an open system; the sun constantly gives the planet energy in the form of light, while it is eventually used and lost in the form of heat throughout the trophic levels of a food web. Carbon is used to make carbohydrates, fats and proteins, the major sources of food energy. These compounds are oxidised to release carbon dioxide, which can be captured by plants to make organic compounds. The chemical reaction is powered by the light energy of the sun. It is possible for an ecosystem to obtain energy without sunlight. Carbon must be combined with hydrogen and oxygen in order to be utilised as an energy source, and this process depends on sunlight. Ecosystems in the deep sea, where no sunlight can penetrate, use sulphur. Hydrogen sulphide near hydrothermal vents can be utilised by organisms such as the giant tube worm. In the sulphur cycle, sulphur can be forever recycled as a source of energy. Energy can be released through the oxidation and reduction of sulphur compounds (e.g., oxidising elemental sulphur to sulphite and then to sulphate).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Although the Earth constantly receives energy from the sun, its chemical composition is essentially fixed, as additional matter is only occasionally added by meteorites. Because this chemical composition is not replenished like energy, all processes that depend on these chemicals must be recycled. These cycles include both the living biosphere and the nonliving lithosphere, atmosphere and hydrosphere. The chemicals are sometimes held for long periods of time in one place. This place is called a reservoir, which, for example, includes such things as coal deposits that are storing carbon for a long period of time. When chemicals are held for only short periods of time, they are being held in exchange pools. Examples of exchange pools include plants and animals. Plants and animals utilise carbon to produce carbohydrates, fats and proteins, which can then be used to build their internal structures or to obtain energy. Plants and animals temporarily use carbon in their systems and then release it back into the air or surrounding medium. Generally, reservoirs are abiotic factors whereas exchange pools are biotic factors. Carbon is held for a relatively short time in plants and animals in comparison to coal deposits. The amount of time that a chemical is held in one place is called its residence.</Para>

Accumulation of humic acids, pectins, lignins and chitin may be the result of the latter degradation processes. Microbial transformation requires a wide range of enzymes, including cellulases for plant material, lipases for lipids, amylases for starch, proteases for proteins, amidases for chitin and oxygenases for lignin. A single bacterial species probably will not have any genetic information for more than one or two of these enzymes.

Mercury is probably the most publicised example of a substance that was more toxic after microbial transformation. The anaerobic activities of microorganisms in sediments caused methylation of mercury. As a result, the mercury was made more water soluble and was mobilised from the sediment and more thoroughly mixed with the water column. More toxic forms of the element showed that bacteria, through bioaccumulation of mercury and consumption by higher organism, can enhance the concentration of mercury in aquatic food chains. Methylation of elements (cadmium, arsenic, tin) by microorganisms can also potentially produce a more toxic by-product.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Crude oil contains many polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons that are slowly degraded and could yield intermediate degradation products that are carcinogenic and mutagenic. Organophosphate insecticides have Pâ€‰=â€‰S bonds and could be oxidised by bacteria to corresponding Pâ€‰=â€‰O (oxone) derivatives, which have considerably greater mammalian toxicity. Bacteria participate in N-alkylation and nitrosamination leading to the formation of nitrosamines from a variety of common precursors such as secondary amines and nitrites. Nitrosamines are powerful carcinogens and mutagens. Although many of these potential degradation products are not toxic to bacteria, bacterial activities lead to their formation.</Para>
