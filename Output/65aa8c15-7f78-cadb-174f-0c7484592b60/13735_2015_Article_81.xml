              <Para ID="Par1">Due to the ubiquitous existence of large-scale data in today’s real-world applications, including learning on cross-media data, we propose a semi-supervised learning method, named Multiple Binary Subspace Regression, for cross-media data concept detection. In order to mine the common features among the data with multiple modalities, we project the original cross-media data onto the same subspace-level representation simultaneously by mapping to the corresponding subspaces for dimensionality reduction. All the subspaces are set to be binary, which only involve the addition operations and omit the multiplication operations in the subsequent computation owing to the good property of the binary values. The dimensionality reduction to a binary subspace and the concept detection on this subspace are also optimized simultaneously leading to a semi-supervised model. For dealing with large-scale data, our learning method is easily implemented to run in a MapReduce-based Hadoop system. Empirical studies demonstrate its competitive performance on convergence, efficiency, and scalability in comparison with the state-of-the-art literature.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par2">In many real-world applications, one data instance usually has different representations. This is especially true for cross-media data. By cross-media data, it is meant that data exist in different modalities from multiple sources such that knowledge discovery must be done simultaneously and synergistically across these different modalities [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>]. Cross-media concept detection is the application to detect the concept of the cross-media data. For example, an instance can be described by different types of features, such as image features, text features, and audio features. How to effectively make use of the cross-media features has received intensive attention in the literature.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par3">Though individual feature modalities might be sufficient on their own for a given learning task, they can often provide complementary information to each other resulting in an improved performance on the learning task in many cross-media applications. Thus, it is a challenging problem to discover the consistent information hidden in the different modalities. Such consistent information not only contains the sharing concepts among all the modalities, but also involves the differences for the discriminative nature of the different modalities. Most of the existing algorithms [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>] ignore such information and adopt originally provided features for the classifier design leading to a suboptimal solution.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par4">With the rapid development and popular use of Internet and other digital resources, the volume of the data keeps growing in a quite fast speed. Given the fact that today’s data are generally of a huge size, a distributed algorithm is of great importance in accelerating the learning speed on a large-scale cross-media dataset. Conventional parallel regression models [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>] give their design of parallel implementations regardless of accelerating the learning feature procedure, whereas our approach explicitly takes this into consideration.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par5">Based on the above observations, we propose a multiple binary subspace regression (MBSR) algorithm that deals with the large-scale cross-media concept detection problem. Note that directly conducting a learning approach on the original data space is generally intractable due to the high-dimensional characteristics and may lose the common information shared by the different modalities; we accomplish a joint subspace mapping and learn a concept detection model simultaneously as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>, which is different from the traditional modality-independent training methods and has a better training speed. To further speed up the training and testing procedures, we accelerate our model by adding a binary constraint on the feature mapping function. Since the binary data only include zeros and ones, multiplications become simple additions. This fact simplifies the subsequent computations and is quite attractive in a large-scale problem solving. Moreover, due to the fact that the unlabeled data are easier to obtain than the labeled data in the real world, especially in the applications with large-scale data, MBSR is designed as a semi-supervised model that utilizes the labeled data and the unlabeled data simultaneously. Due to the large-scale data computation, we design a way to apply the learning model to a MapReduce-based Hadoop system.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

              <Para ID="Par11">The cross-media or multimodal information retrieval and classification are the popular applications in recent years [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>]. For such applications, concept detection [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>] plays a key role to result in reasonable solutions. Recent literature such as [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>] shows that linear regression is successfully used in the applications of data fitting and concept detection. For capturing the concepts of the high-dimensional data, subspace methods are proposed recently. Yuan et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>] present a fast part-based subspace selection algorithm, called the binary sparse nonnegative matrix factorization, which makes full use of the sparseness property. Hua et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>] propose a semi-supervised concept factorization, called discriminative concept factorization, instead of the nonnegative matrix factorization technique for data representation. They accomplish a linear regression task on the result of factorization.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par12">Conventional algorithms work well on relatively small datasets that can be stored in the memory. However, such sequential algorithms are very slow due to the frequent disk access and are easy to exceed the disk space. Therefore, scalable approaches (e.g., [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]) are introduced to solve the large-scale concept detection problem. Meanwhile, optimization methods are proposed for parallel computing such as stochastic gradient descent, coordinate descent, and distributed least square method.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par13">Stochastic gradient descent method decomposes the original problem into many smaller problems and utilizes the gradient descent method on stochastically selected smaller problems. Zinkevich et al. present a novel data-parallel, stochastic gradient descent algorithm in which the training data are accessed locally and only the model is communicated at the very end [<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>]. Bottou applies the second-order stochastic gradient and averaged stochastic gradient to solve large-scale learning problems [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Gemulla et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>] solve the distributed matrix factorization problem also based on stochastic gradient descent method.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par14">Coordinate descent is another popular parallel strategy in the literature. Coordinate descent generally changes the original problem to many one-variable subproblems while fixing the other variables. Chang et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>] propose a novel coordinate descent algorithm for training a linear SVM with the <InlineEquation ID="IEq1">

              <Para ID="Par15">Bagging strategy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>] is a parallel approach utilized for distributed problems recently. Studies have applied the bagging approach to a distributed system [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>]. The bagging approach has an advantage of fitting for the implementation to distributed computing techniques such as MapReduce. Recently, [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>] considers the alternating direction method of the multiplier method for distributed learning. Yu et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>] propose a block minimization framework for primal and dual SVMs. Mateos et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>] distribute sparse linear regression by quadratic programming or coordinate descent.

[<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>] corresponds to the dimensionality reduction component that factorizes the data matrix into two lower-rank matrices. Liu et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>] aim to achieve sparse solutions while our approach aims to a binary solution for parallelization. Besides, our approach focuses on proposing a distributed regression approach to predicting the concept of the cross-media data samples. This paper is a concept detection application extension of the work [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>] in three aspects: (i) the goal of this paper is to train a concept detection model by making use of the cross-media features and then to predict the concept of new data samples. (ii) we introduce the parallel implementation details on the MapReduce-based Hadoop framework in Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec9">3.3</InternalRef> in this paper.

In general, the original features should be mapped to subspace-level representations. Considering that the different modalities share some common relations and reveal some other different latent information, it is reasonable to map all the features with different modalities to the same subspace-level representation. This mapping strategy leads to two advantages. One is to discover the sharing relation in all the features. The other is to decrease the complexity of computing the regression. Thus, the optimized problem becomes<Equation ID="Equ2">

This idea is known as row–column exchangeability [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>]. Based on this property of matrices, a matrix can be partitioned based on the strategies such as bagging directly, random partition, and the partition based on a special structure. For a convenient operation consideration, the first two strategies of the partition are widely used in real-world applications, especially for a Hadoop framework.</Para>

                    <Emphasis Type="Italic">Initialization stability analysis</Emphasis> Since MBSR leads to a local optimum, it is necessary to evaluate whether the testing accuracy is sensitive to an initialization. For each dataset, we conduct 10 experiments with different random initializations to check its stability. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef> reports all the accuracy values in ten different runs. The running times with different initializations are not reported here, because an initialization strategy only changes the values in the matrix and it does not affect the computation complexity. The experimental results indicate that MBSR is not sensitive to the initialization, although it does not achieve a global solution.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab1">

It is observed from Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">2</InternalRef> that MBSR achieves a higher accuracy than the competing algorithms consistently. To investigate how the unlabeled data affect the performance by varying the number of the unlabeled data points, we have actually conducted a series of experiments with different numbers of the unlabeled data points on the NUS-WIDE dataset. The results show that increasing the amount of the unlabeled training data may improve the accuracy moderately to a certain degree by sacrificing the running speed.

The accuracy in the Y axis represents the testing accuracy value at each iteration. Note that all the five methods have different objective functions, making it unreasonable to compare the difference in function loss. Therefore, we use the accuracy instead of the objective function loss to show the convergence speed. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig7">7</InternalRef>a shows the result on the NUS-WIDE data, which indicates that MBSR has a noticeable improvement over the other four methods. Besides this, the curve of MBSR appears smoother than those of the other methods, indicating that MBSR is more stable. Note that DR obtains the worst accuracy and the lowest convergence speed. The curve of DR does not start from time 0 due to the fact that DR costs some time to accomplish the dimensionality reduction. SCD, D-Lasso, and LLR have a similar convergence performance except that SCD converges a little faster and LLR achieves a better accuracy. However, MBSR converges to the best local minimum and has the fastest convergence rate of all the methods.

                    <Emphasis Type="Italic">Efficiency</Emphasis> Having presented the results on the convergence, we turn the focus on another important factor efficiency. The efficiency here is defined as a parallel algorithm’s performance with respect to the number of the mappers. We examine this factor to verify whether a model works well in a large-scale distributed system. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig8">8</InternalRef> reports the running speed improvement of the five methods with the increasing number of the mappers on NUS-WIDE and Wikipedia data, respectively. The speedup means the relative speed improvement of the multi-mapper environment over the one-mapper environment. The upper bound is along the diagonal, which goes linearly with the increase of the number of the mappers. A higher slope means that a model suits better for a large-scale, distributed system. The results indicate that MBSR achieves the best speedup performance of all the methods. The reason why the practical speedup cannot achieve the theoretical upper bound is mainly due to the communication cost among various machines. However, as the number of the mappers increases, the speedup increases monotonically with the increasing number of the mappers, which indicates that the communication cost does not dominate the main cost of an algorithm.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig8">

To do this, we create new feature vectors by randomly selecting existing feature vectors and then adding exponential noise with a mean value 0.1. This process is run repeatedly until the datasets are scaled up to 10 million instances. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab3">3</InternalRef> documents the time costs of different methods when in convergence. Unfortunately, when an experiment is conducted on the very large datasets, SCD and D-Lasso always report memory crash. Therefore, only the results of LLR and DR are reported here for the comparison.

                  <Para ID="Par65">We further examine how time cost goes with the number of the instances to show whether MBSR can truly deal with large datasets or not. To obtain different sizes of data, we randomly sample instances with a replacement from the original dataset. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig9">9</InternalRef> reports the scalability study by showing the convergence speed on different subsets of NUS-WIDE and Wikipedia datasets, respectively. We note that MBSR has a noticeably clear improvement over LLR and DR on the scalability for both datasets, as the convergence speed gap between MBSR and the other two methods increases when the dataset size also increases. Clearly, LLR and DR have higher time complexity than MBSR, which shows that adding the binary constraint can accelerate the computation speed. In principle, the binary subspace learning is capable of taking less disk space and computer memory leading to reducing the computation complexity.

              <Para ID="Par67">We have developed a distributed, semi-supervised algorithm, called Multiple Binary Subspace Regression (MBSR), that scales up well for very large-scale data. It is designed for large-scale, cross-media data concept detection. Given the fact that data in many cross-media learning problems are large scale in nature, MBSR serves well as an effective and efficient core to the solutions. Theoretical and empirical studies in comparison with the existing literature demonstrate MBSR’s competitive performance on the effectiveness, convergence, efficiency, and scalability.</Para>
