              <Para TextBreak="No">Neighborhood conditions – risks and resources – influence a range of individual behaviors for both adults and adolescents. While a growing literature explores the effects of neighborhood resources on individual behaviors, few studies focus on adolescents. Moreover, limited research explores both neighborhood risks and neighborhood resources. Data for this paper are from adolescents (aged 13–18) in the Seattle metropolitan area surveyed from 1998 to 2003. We explore the impact of neighborhood resources on three behavioral and health outcomes (alcohol use, depressed affect, and risky conduct behavior), while controlling for neighborhood disadvantage. By exploring multiple outcomes among adolescents and different ­features of the neighborhood environment, this paper provides insight into the ways in which positive aspects of neighborhood context matter for youth.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">This research is couched at the intersection of demography and public health. The health behaviors – alcohol use, depression affect, and risky conduct behavior – addressed in this paper are precursors to more serious outcomes of substance abuse, depression, juvenile delinquency and crime, all of which are serious public health concerns. Taking a demographic perspective, this paper explores behavioral patterns during a major developmental period of the life course. Adolescence is a key transitional stage that is important for demographic research. Moreover, quantitative approaches to tease apart different types of neighborhood effects from each other and from individual correlates is consistent with demographic methods and conceptual frameworks. This type of demographic health research has implications for public policy and health promotion programming – in terms of creating positive neighborhood spaces and resources – which is a central feature of public health research.</Para>

              <Heading>Background</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Multiple aspects about neighborhoods have been linked to individual health and behavioral and outcomes. Most neighborhood research focuses on the effects of risk factors, namely economic or social disadvantage, relying on a social disorganization or stress perspective (Jencks and Mayer <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">1990</CitationRef>; Massey <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">1996</CitationRef>; Shaw and McKay <CitationRef CitationID="CR33">1942</CitationRef>; Wilson <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">1996</CitationRef>). Drawing from theories of social capital, an alternative approach explores the ways in which neighborhood resources benefit health. Disadvantage and resource frameworks are not necessarily incompatible. Indeed, researchers assert that economically disadvantaged neighborhoods often contain important neighborhood organizational resources and are sources of positive social support (Sampson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">1997</CitationRef>; Wilson <CitationRef CitationID="CR42">1987</CitationRef>). In this perspective, resources are not simply the opposite end of the disadvantage continuum, but can co-exist alongside disadvantage in neighborhoods. This paper explores positive dimensions of neighborhood conditions from the perspective that the presence of positive public spaces and service amenities in the environment impact adolescent well-being by providing opportunities for socialization and resource utilization.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec3">
                <Heading>Neighborhood Resources</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Neighborhoods have resources that may protect individuals against negative health outcomes or risk behaviors associated with negative health outcomes. Services and public places, such as community centers or youth focused services (e.g., Boys and Girls clubs), may decrease unhealthy or problematic behaviors through involvement, socialization, and modeling. Such neighborhood resources provide opportunities for interaction, support and activity. In general, neighborhood resources have implications for social trust (Curley <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2010</CitationRef>), neighborhood attachment (Greif <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2009</CitationRef>), employment (Mendenhall et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2006</CitationRef>), and crime (Peterson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">2000</CitationRef>). Neighborhood resources are important for social capital in that they enhance or impede social connections and networks. In this area of research, key aspects of social capital include social support, social leverage, informal social control, and neighborhood organization participation (Carpiano <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2008</CitationRef>). For example, in a study exploring relocation of HOPE VI residents, authors find that neighborhood resources are strong predictors of social capital, which had implications for social trust (Curley <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Several studies explore the influence of neighborhood resources for adults and find support for a protective effect, especially for health outcomes. In a study of female caregivers, Carpiano (<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2008</CitationRef>) reports that three forms of neighborhood social capital have positive implications for health. Moreover, neighborhood resources, support among friends, and community organizations were associated with adherence to self-care behaviors among adult diabetics (Shaw et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">2006</CitationRef>). In addition, supportive neighborhood environments (street connectivity, amenities, lack of incivilities) were associated with lower rates of obesity among public housing residents (Heinrich et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Studies also link neighborhood resources and services to a range of behaviors in childhood and adolescence. Neighborhood resources, including resident support services (e.g., social service agency, parks) were associated with fewer daily hassles (family, peer, school, and neighborhood) reported by youth (Anthony and Nicotera <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2008</CitationRef>). Youth perceptions of high quality local facilities (e.g., equipment is good and available, facilities are open when needed, and facilities are fun), rather than the total number of facilities, are associated with more physical activity (Romero <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">2005</CitationRef>). A study of middle childhood highlights the importance of family and neighborhood resources for social-emotional functioning (Bryant <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">1985</CitationRef>). Neighborhood organizations or services were associated with lower levels of aggression among urban youth (Molnar et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2008</CitationRef>). Moreover, Molnar and collaborators conclude that family, peer, and mentoring resources may only be beneficial when found in high concentrations.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In addition to direct neighborhood effects, researchers are increasingly examining the moderating role of neighborhoods in adolescent development and behavior. Moderating effects have been found for multiple adolescent outcomes including drug use (Fuller et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2005</CitationRef>), internalizing and externalizing behavior (Spencer et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR40">1997</CitationRef>), and social and behavioral adjustment (Kupersmidt et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">1995</CitationRef>). Neighborhood moderating effects have been reported between neighborhood resources and family factors (Kupersmidt et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">1995</CitationRef>; Klebanov et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">1994</CitationRef>) and neighborhood education, neighborhood minority composition and individual race (Fuller et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2005</CitationRef>), and neighborhood risk and coping behaviors (Spencer et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR40">1997</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">This study is innovative in its assessment of multiple health and risk outcomes among adolescents, focusing on alcohol use, depressed affect, and risky conduct behavior. A unique contribution is that we explore the direct and moderating effects of neighborhood resources alongside neighborhood disadvantage, bringing both positive and negative aspects of context together in one study.</Para>

              <Heading>Sample and Measures</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Data for this paper are from adolescents (aged 13–18) in the Seattle metropolitan area surveyed from 1998 to 2003 as part of the Reconnecting Youth (RY) prevention research project. The sample represents a cross-sectional, random sample of high school youth (aged 14–19). It is stratified by high risk of school dropout; over the period three contiguous school districts (17 high schools) are represented in the survey, with only one high school declining to participate. Students with low school performance (low GPA, high absenteeism, and/or prior dropout/suspension were part of the criteria assessed from school records) were over sampled resulting in the construction and use of sampling weights in analyses. The over sampling of high-­risk youth should produce variation in the behavioral and health outcomes, as the selection criteria are related to a variety of problematic outcomes.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Sixteen high schools in the Seattle and surrounding school districts participated in health/drug use interventions and/or surveys over the period. The analyses use data from three separate RY study sources conducted between 1998 and 2003: “Preventing Drug Abuse: Parents and Youths with Schools.” (National Institute on Drug Abuse –NIDA), “Reconnecting Youth: Replication of an Indicated Prevention Program in Multicultural Settings” (Department of Education – DoE) and “Assessing Suicide Risk among Adolescents” (Centers for Disease Control – CDC). Merging the datasets increases our sample size and subsequent power and is appropriate given that the data sets are compatible in terms of: (1) the sampling frame and definition of high risk; (2) the content of the survey and format of survey administration; and (3) the region/schools and time period. All study youth agreed to participate, and parents provided consent in accordance with approved University of Washington IRB protocols. The analysis in this paper is based on data obtained prior to participants knowing to which condition within the randomized controlled trial they had been assigned.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">For this analysis, we use part of the sample in which detailed resources and service data were available by census tract. This limited the sample to the city of Seattle, including students from nine Seattle high schools. Student home addresses from the individual-level dataset are geocoded and spatially linked to the appropriate census tract. In total, 1,661 individual respondents are included in the combined dataset, and more than 97 census tracts are represented in the data.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Following the research on neighborhood analysis, the neighborhood data in this project are operationalized at the census tract level (Billy and Moore <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">1992</CitationRef>; Crane <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">1991</CitationRef>; Ku et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">1993</CitationRef>). Data are compiled from the 2000 U.S. Census (e.g., population density and economic indicators) and City of Seattle (neighborhood services and public places) from 2000. Measures of neighborhood resources are captured by enumerating the resources in each census tract for three variables: boys and girls clubs, community centers, and public health clinics. The intent is to measure resources expected to provide positive service programs for adolescents and reflect some level of community involvement through local participation (e.g., volunteers). Other possible resources, such as parks or hospitals, were not always clear in their positive valence as a resource. For example, some parks may offer opportunity for negative behaviors rather than necessarily act as a positive resource. Other studies using a similar set of resource measures (Curley <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2010</CitationRef>) report that these measures capture people’s perceptions of key resources (Yen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A composite measure to represent economic <Emphasis Type="Italic">Neighborhood Disadvantage</Emphasis> is based on a scale constructed by Sampson and collaborators (<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">1997</CitationRef>). This index is composed of a mean of four indicators of economic disadvantage at the census tract level: percentages of residents below the federal poverty level, households headed by a female, residents receiving public assistance, and residents aged 16 years or older that are unemployed (reliability = 0.82). <Emphasis Type="Italic">Population density</Emphasis> of the census tract is measured per 1,000 people and is used to control for census tract size.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">All outcomes and individual level independent variables come from the Reconnecting Youth High School Questionnaire (HSQ), a detailed self-report questionnaire capturing a range of youth behaviors including substance use, peer and family relations, and school behaviors. We focus on three categories of behavior for adolescents: substance use, mental health, and risky conduct behavior (reflecting early deviance or delinquency). We assess the frequency of alcohol use<Footnote ID="Fn1">
                  <Para TextBreak="No">We also explored <Emphasis Type="Italic">illicit drugs</Emphasis> (cocaine, opiates, depressants, tranquilizers, inhaled substances, stimulants, and over the counter drugs) but the HLM logit models failed to converge probably due to the limited frequency of affirmative responses for these items.</Para>
                </Footnote> during the past month (beer, wine, and hard liquor) based on questions derived from Monitoring the Future; frequency was gauged on a 7 point scale from 0 (no use) to 6 (daily use). For mental health we assess a scale of <Emphasis Type="Italic">depressed affect</Emphasis> (reliability between .80 and.89 across different surveys). The scale is a modified 6 item version of the CES-D depression index using a 0–6 Likert scale of frequency; prior work shows this smaller scale to have high reliability and correlates well with the larger scale (Eggert et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">1994</CitationRef>). A composite measure of <Emphasis Type="Italic">risky conduct behavior</Emphasis> includes the frequency of assault, theft, police contact, and disciplined at school for fighting over the past year (based on a 0–6 Likert scale).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">We include measures designed to capture psychosocial risk and protective factors: <Emphasis Type="Italic">personal control</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">family support</Emphasis>, and <Emphasis Type="Italic">peer high risk behavior. Personal control</Emphasis> reflects a mean score based on five items tapping into personal agency and coping abilities (Cronbach’s alpha = .82). Representative items include, “I feel confident that I can handle my personal problems,” and “When I try, I can make good things happen for me.” <Emphasis Type="Italic">Family support</Emphasis> is based on the extent of and satisfaction with help provided by immediate family members comprised of five items (Cronbach’s alpha = .89). Representative items include, “My parent(s) support my activities,” and “I feel satisfied with the way my family and I share time together.” <Emphasis Type="Italic">Peer high risk behavior</Emphasis> captures the amount of close friends involved in five different delinquent behaviors (Cronbach’s alpha = .85). Items include responses to the question “How many of your close friends…” for example, “skip school?” and “Have gotten into physical fights with other kids?” Specific details about all of the questions that comprise each construct are available upon request. All scales are adapted from known scales and based on 0–6 Likert items (Thompson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR41">2005</CitationRef>). We include controls for age, sex, race and ethnicity, high risk for school dropout, time spent on activities (clubs, volunteering, and attending religious services), family structure and parent’s educational attainment.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Multilevel techniques (hierarchical linear models-HLM) are used to assess the impact of resource and risk context on adolescent well-being. A hierarchical model explicitly incorporates variables at the individual level and at the contextual level and accounts for the clustering of individuals in the aggregate unit. HLM allows key parameters of interest at the individual level to vary across local contexts, and our interest is to see if this variation is systematically associated with neighborhood factors (Raudenbush and Bryk <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2002</CitationRef>; Snijders and Bosker <CitationRef CitationID="CR39">1999</CitationRef>). We assess direct influences of neighborhood context on three categories of adolescent behaviors. Specifically, we examine if neighborhood resources have a significant direct effect on predicting adolescent behavioral and health outcomes – substance use, mental health, and risky conduct behavior – while controlling for key individual- and neighborhood-level variables known to be associated with health and risk behaviors among youth. We explore cross-sectional associations among neighborhood characteristics and health and risk behaviors.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In the first model, the three behavior outcomes types (alcohol use, depressed affect, and risky conduct behavior) are regressed separately on the three neighborhood variables (resources, disadvantage, and population density). These models test for any effects of neighborhood dimensions on substance use, depressed affect, or risky conduct behavior without specific individual controls. Second, an individual-­level model is added, including personal control, family support/structure, high risk peer behaviors, and basic control variables. This second model tests for any neighborhood effects after controlling for key individual-level factors. All continuous variables (age, parent education, personal control, family support, and high risk peers) are centered on their respective grand means. The individual (level 1) and neighborhood (level 2) can be seen in two equations below where the subscript i represents individuals and j represents neighborhood:

For the 1,661 students in the analysis, the ages ranged from 13 to 18 years, with a mean of 15.70. It is a racially-mixed sample with 38% white, 22% black, 16% Asian/Pacific Islander, 4% Hispanic, and 20% reporting other race or ethnicity (includes self-reported mixed ethnicity 14%, American Indian/Native Alaskan 3%, other 3%). Sixty-eight percent of the sample were at risk for dropping out of high school based on poor school performance; this reflects the stratified nature of the sample. Just less than half of the students come from homes with a biological mother and father present (45%). Measures of parent educational attainment revealed an average of 15.2 years of schooling. The response options for personal control and family support ranged from 0 to 6, with the averages being 4.28 and 3.44, respectively. Most students reported low levels of peer high risk behavior (<InlineEquation ID="IEq1">

                </Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">There was variability among the 97 census tracts. The mean count of all of the three neighborhood resource variables was less than 1 ranging from 0 to 2. The mean neighborhood disadvantage score for the census tracts in our sample was 6.8, falling within a range of 2.6–21.7. The population density variable reflected a mean of almost 8 ranging from less than 1–33.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Significant variation at the census tract level was found for all outcomes, which justifies incorporating neighborhood level variables into the model. In the first set of models, neighborhood resources, disadvantage, and population density were included in the model to test for effects of neighborhood factors on adolescent alcohol use, depressed affect, and risky conduct behavior without controlling for any individual-level factors. The only significant neighborhood effects were for alcohol and risky conduct behavior. The presence of public health clinics was negatively associated with alcohol use; adolescents living in neighborhoods with more services have lower rates of alcohol use. In addition, neighborhood disadvantage was negatively related to alcohol use; adolescents living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods had lower rates of alcohol usage. For risky conduct behavior, public health clinics were significantly negatively associated. Surprisingly, no neighborhood constructs achieved significance for the depressed affect scale.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Including the individual-level model did not dramatically alter the influence of the neighborhood variables. For alcohol, both resources and disadvantage and neighborhood services were still significant and in the same directions. For risky conduct behavior, two neighborhood resources – boys and girls clubs and public health clinics – achieved statistical significance. Adolescents living in neighborhoods with more of these resources had lower rates of risky conduct behavior. Similar to the effects found in the first model, there were no neighborhood effects for depressed affect.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In the second set of models individual variables operated in a consistent manner with previous research. Race was important for alcohol but not for depressed affect or risky behavior. For alcohol, white (compared with blacks and Asians) youth reported higher levels of alcohol use (see Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">13.2</InternalRef>). Age was only significant for alcohol use where older respondents reported greater use while for risky conduct behavior. There were no significant differences between boys and girls for alcohol use but there were for both depressed affect and risky conduct behaviors, with higher rates for girls and boys, respectively, and consistent with the literature. Being at risk for dropping out of high school was associated with greater alcohol use and risky conduct behaviors but no impact on depressed affect. Spending time in activities had a negative effect for alcohol use but no effect for the other behavioral and health outcomes. Higher parental education, as measured in years, was negative for all three outcomes but never achieved significance. The personal control measure was only significant for depressed affect and was associated with lower reported depressed affect. As expected, higher levels of family support were associated with lower frequency of both depressed affect and risky conduct behavior. Unexpectedly, family support was not related to alcohol use. In line with previous research, having high risk peers was strongly associated with greater alcohol use, depressed affect, and risky conduct behavior.

              <Para TextBreak="No">The results in this paper showed some impact of neighborhood resources – boys and girls clubs and public health clinics – for select adolescent outcomes, specifically alcohol use and risky conduct behaviors. No effect was reported for community centers for any of the three outcome categories (substance use, mental health, or risky conduct behavior). While our measures of neighborhood services are arguably only indirect indicators of social capital, the protective role of these measures are consistent with this perspective and other research for adolescent and adult. The finding that the presence of boys and girls clubs was associated with less risky conduct behavior is also in line with specific research on adolescent behavior. Molnar and colleagues report that neighborhood organizations and services specifically targeting youth were associated with lower levels of aggression among urban youth (Molnar et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2008</CitationRef>). Specifically, research on Boys and Girls Clubs suggest that they play a significant role in promoting pro-social youth behaviors and that participation in club activities was associated with positive school outcomes and reduced risk and problem behaviors (Anderson-Butcher et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2003</CitationRef>). Moreover, researchers of adolescent delinquency argue that youth who are socially bonded are less likely to engage in delinquent behavior, such as getting in trouble with the police, and involvement in conventional activities is one of the four key attachments (Hirschi et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2002</CitationRef>). In addition, one study (Pate et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">2008</CitationRef>) found that vigorous physical activity among 12th graders was positively associated with multipurpose facilities such as recreation centers and youth organizations.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In addition to presence of boys and girls clubs, presence of a public health clinic in the neighborhood was associated with lower levels of both alcohol use and risky conduct behavior among our adolescent sample. In general, the service area for public health clinics is large (e.g., corresponding to multiple census tracts in a region of the city); however, the presence of one of these agencies within the census tract of residence for adolescents corresponds with a lower prevalence of problematic individual behaviors. It could be that public health clinics provide specific information, social support, or awareness of problems or more generally that they are indicative of resources in the local environment. In the case of boys and girls clubs, there are staff, resources, and programming targeting teens and adolescent issues, with a preventative and proactive framework more likely; these types of community services providers might act as protectors against risky behaviors. The same process might also be the case for public health clinics, especially in terms of providing resources for sexual and reproductive health (e.g., sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy prevention and prevention of drug and alcohol abuse). As part of their mission in King County, public health clinics aim to protect individual health and well-being by providing information and strategic interventions to reduce disparities.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In addition to direct effects of neighborhood resources on adolescent behaviors, neighborhood disadvantage was also significant for one adolescent outcome. In the case of alcohol use, the neighborhood disadvantage effect was in the direction of decreased usage. Adolescents living in neighborhoods with high levels of economic disadvantage have lower rates of alcohol use. Although this is not consistent with social disorganization and stress perspectives, counter results also appear when assessing school-level substance use rates. Based on student, parent, and archival data from a heterogeneous sample of elementary schools in a Midwestern state, lifetime alcohol use was higher for those in schools located in neighborhoods perceived to be more socially advantaged (Ennett et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">1997</CitationRef>). A recent study reports that teens from affluent, suburban families reported higher levels of substance use than their inner-city counterparts (Luthar and D’Avanzo <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">1999</CitationRef>). We argue elsewhere that this is not out of line with the varied results on adolescent alcohol use and might reflect the experimental nature of alcohol use among teenagers (Snedker et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR38">2009</CitationRef>). Moreover, this relationship holds when controlling for neighborhood alcohol outlet density, but the presence of alcohol outlets in the neighborhood does reduce the protective effect of family resources (Snedker and Herting <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Other spheres that play a pivotal role in adolescent alcohol use, especially the family and peer contexts, might partially explain the direction of these effects. These additional contexts can buffer or exacerbate neighborhood effects. However, we did not find any moderating effects for family support or high risk peers, nor did the inclusion of family or peer variables alter the direction of results. We also speculated that family or parental alcohol/substance use should be controlled at the individual level to insure that the neighborhood effect is accurate. Controlling for the youth’s report of family alcohol/substance use in the household did not alter the observed negative effect of neighborhood disadvantage (results available upon request). More research needs to explore how families and parents broker the neighborhood environment and how that impacts adolescent health and risk behaviors.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">No neighborhood effects for depressed affect were found in these analyses. This is inconsistent with theory and research in the field for mental health for adults and adolescents (Aneshensel and Sucoff <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">1996</CitationRef>; Mair et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2008</CitationRef>). It may be that neighborhoods play indirect effects for these outcomes and moderate key individual-level variables. For example, effects of residential poverty, urbanization, and racial/ethnic composition play a role in mental health, but may interact with status characteristics of the individual (McLeod and Edwards <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">1995</CitationRef>). However, several moderating relationships were assessed between the neighborhood resources variables and the three psychosocial processes (personal control, family support, and peer high risk behavior) and no moderating effects were found (results are available upon request). The role of context with respect to mental health and specifically to mental health of adolescents requires continued attention.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The lack of consistent effects across different types of behaviors also raises issues about the uniformity of neighborhood risks or resources on outcomes for adolescence. It may be that neighborhood context has certain effects for some kinds of behavior and different effects for others. Part of the lack of effect or inconsistencies might relate to issues of access and how easily individuals can avail themselves of the services and public places. With this dataset we are unable to assess use of particular neighborhood resources, however we do control for individual club/sports activity, suggesting that the role of these neighborhood resources is in addition to a given youth’s own individual activity. We find it especially noteworthy that neighborhood resource effects are still apparent while controlling for neighborhood economic disadvantage and a rich-individual-level model.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">It is also worth considering that some resources might actually be risk factors. Yen and colleagues argue that there is some ambiguity between resources and hazards and that distinctions are not always clear (Yen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">2007</CitationRef>). For example, a local park that is known for gang activity, drug sales, or sexual activity is unlikely to be construed as a positive resource by local residents. Research also suggests that the extent to which the neighborhood resources positively impact behavior might be tied to network integration (Carpiano <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2008</CitationRef>) and that adolescents who live in neighborhoods with weak social networks report higher levels of hopelessness, even after controlling for SES and depression (Perez-Smith et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The different direction of neighborhood effects, most notably for adolescent alcohol use, reflects that these neighborhood factors are indeed separate constructs and related to different social process, thus having a different impact on behavioral and health outcomes. Notably, research does not always find that these factors are inversely related. Recent analyses unexpectedly find that as poverty rates increase in neighborhoods so do the number of organizational resources, such as childcare centers and grocery stores (Small and McDermott <CitationRef CitationID="CR36">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Additional conceptual and methodological issues are raised by this analysis. We rely on objective neighborhood indicators of social-structural and physical risks and resources. Research also suggests that perceived conditions might also be important (Anthony and Nicotera <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2008</CitationRef>). However, research reports that there is a reasonably strong correlation between perceived and actual neighborhood resources (Yen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">2007</CitationRef>). We note that census tracts are not equivalent of neighborhoods, and the size may be too large to truly capture the impact of local context on behaviors. However, smaller units, such as block-groups, tend to yield few contextual differences with census-tract measures (Diez Roux et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2001</CitationRef>). In a study of urban women, perceptions of neighborhood boundaries varied by income level, such that women in poorer neighborhoods understood their neighborhoods as smaller (Yen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">2007</CitationRef>). Different configurations of neighborhood space are needed. In this paper we explore the presence of certain neighborhood resources, but this does not necessarily denote quality presence. Future analyses should tap into individual access to and use of neighborhood resources, which might provide a more complete picture of the impact of neighborhood environments on adolescent behaviors. Finally, there is some concern about the generalizability of the results. While the data set is largely representative of high school age youth in the Seattle metropolitan area, it is unclear how generalizable the results are to all cities; this may especially be true of the larger U.S. cities such as New York where levels of disadvantage may be more ­pervasive and extreme.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">This research has clear implications for those interested in a better understanding of the relationship between neighborhood context and individual-level outcomes. For prevention scientists and practitioners, the linkages between neighborhood conditions and problem behaviors for youth can inform prevention programs and interventions (Kegler et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2005</CitationRef>). In addition to the neighborhood resources assessed in this paper, other such resources need to be explored. Some neighborhood resources such as churches, schools, and childcare centers are what Small calls “resource brokers” and may be especially important (Small <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">2006</CitationRef>). Further specifying the relationship between neighborhood resources and risky behaviors for youth is an important direction for future research and prevention studies.</Para>
