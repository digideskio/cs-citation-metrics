              <Para>Water quality can be evaluated using biomarkers such as tissular enzymatic activities of endemic species. Measurement of molluscs bivalves activity at high frequency (e.g., valvometry) during a long time period is another way to record the animal behavior and to evaluate perturbations of the water quality in real time. As the pollution affects the activity of oysters, we consider the valves opening and closing velocities to monitor the water quality assessment. We propose to model the huge volume of velocity data collected in the framework of valvometry using a new nonparametric extreme values statistical model. The objective is to estimate the tail probabilities and the extreme quantiles of the distribution of valve closing velocity. The tail of the distribution function of valve closing velocity is modeled by a Pareto distribution with parameter <Emphasis Type="Italic">𝜃</Emphasis>

Our modeling approach reveals the dependence between the specific activity of two enzymatic biomarkers (Glutathione-<Emphasis Type="Italic">S</Emphasis>-transferase and acetylcholinesterase) and the continuous recording of oyster valve velocity, proving the suitability of this tool for water quality assessment. Thus, valvometry allows in real-time in situ analysis of the bivalves behavior and appears as an effective early warning tool in ecological risk assessment and marine environment monitoring.</Para>

              <Para>The gulf of Morbihan, which belongs to the club of the most beautiful bays in the world, is an inland sea in the south of Brittany (France) about 10 miles long by 6 miles wide. This is a well storm-protected area where commercial cultivation of Pacific oyster, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Crassostrea gigas</Emphasis>, is widely practiced with 1600 ha given over to this activity. This coastal area is exposed every year during spring and summer times to the significant pressure of tourism and boating (2 million tourists per year). Moreover, the gulf of Morbihan is surrounded by agricultural fields that can generate surface water pollution from pesticides and fertilizers. The possible negative impact of all these human activities on the health of this aquatic ecosystem is an increasing concern. In this context, there is a need to develop a real-time reliable in situ assay to monitor the water quality within a decision making process.</Para>
              <Para>Endemic species are the most suitable bioindicators for the assessment of the quality of the coastal environment. Among them, oyster, a well-known filter-feeding mollusc, features a relevant sentinel organism to evaluate water quality of the gulf of Morbihan. Within bioindicators, biomarkers are used in a predictive way because the response to pollution firstly occurs at low levels (molecule, cell) of biological organization (Peakall <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">1999</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para>Specific exposure biomarkers such as tissular enzymes are widely used to provide information on xenobiotics uptake, biotransformation, detoxification, and physiological patterns, at both laboratory and field scales. In bivalve molluscs, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione-<Emphasis Type="Italic">S</Emphasis>-transferase (GST) are two commonly used enzymatic biomarkers. The relationship between the presence of pesticides in aquatic environments and tissue AChE activity has been widely described. The evaluation of AChE activity inhibition is a useful tool to assess their impact on aquatic biota, even when the pesticides themselves are no longer detectable in the environment (Monserrat et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">2007</CitationRef>). GST isoforms have widely been used as biomarkers of exposure to a range of organic xenobiotics and oxidative metabolic by-products. The pollution is revealed by an increased biotransformation activity level of GST (Ketterer et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">1983</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para>However, these biomarkers yield low-frequency data, due to laborious experiments, and require to analyze numerous animals. Conversely, valvometry is a non-invasive method allowing in situ, high-frequency data acquisition. Oysters, as other bivalve molluscs, close their shell in reaction to environmental disturbances. Thus, recording of shell gaping activity of oysters is an effective method to study their behavior when facing water pollution. This method has been explored in ecotoxicology, first under laboratory conditions (Garcia-March et al.<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2008</CitationRef>; Riisgard et al.<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2006</CitationRef>; Robson et al.<CitationRef CitationID="CR27">2007</CitationRef>). Nowadays, valvometric techniques produce high-frequency data, enabling online and in situ studies of the behavior of bivalve molluscs, freely living in their natural habitat. They allow autonomous long-term recordings of valve movements without interfering with normal behavior. These high-frequency data are analyzed using different statistical models (Azaïs et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2014</CitationRef>; Coudret et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2015</CitationRef>; Jou and Liao <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2006</CitationRef>; Schmitt et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">2011</CitationRef>; Sow et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2011</CitationRef>). The aim of our pluridisciplinary work is to construct a water quality monitoring system through the observation of extreme behavior of oysters. We propose a nonparametric statistical method based on extreme value theory to determine and predict the probabilities of extreme events.</Para>
              <Para>The present study describes a project focused on the validation of a routine monitoring approach using <Emphasis Type="Italic">C. gigas</Emphasis> to estimate the gulf of Morbihan water quality. Oyster valve activity records were compared with two selected proven enzymatic biomarkers (AChE and GST activities, Blanchette et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2007</CitationRef>; Fulton and Key <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2001</CitationRef>). Interestingly, statistical data treatment and modeling allowed to evidence a link between valvometry and specific activity of tissular enzymes. These results suggest that there is a valvometry signature that could be used as a useful tool to detect in real time the presence of chemicals in marine environment.</Para>

                <Para>Locmariaquer is an important oyster farming area located near the narrow tidal pass which connects the gulf of Morbihan to the ocean, on the right side of the Auray river’s mouth. Thus, oysters are close to the seasonal high traffic of the navigation channel and are potentially exposed to chemicals of intensive agricultural practices. Moreover, the sediment mobilisation due to passage of shipping is supposed to be an important factor worsening pollution. This zone is submitted to a strong tidal range varying from 2.4 to 4.7 m between neap and spring tide and consequently, to relatively important streams. The water temperature ranged from 10 to 23 <Superscript>∘</Superscript>C throughout the experimental period. Water salinity is 34 ‰.</Para>
                <Para>About 1000 diploid oysters, of initial calibrated size about 6 cm (18 month old), originated from Marennes Oleron (Charente-maritime, France) and bred at Locmariaquer, were randomly and equally placed in 50 large mesh bags. On February 2011, these bags were laid on metallic racks in the intertidal zone 260 m off the shore. The site 47 <Superscript>∘</Superscript> 34 N, 2 <Superscript>∘</Superscript> 56 W is accessible on foot at low tide from a tidal coefficient of 60. The experimental period ranged from February 2011 to July 2012.</Para>
                <Para>To monitor the seasonal course of enzymatic activities over a long period of time, one bag containing the oysters was randomly weekly collected, during spring/summer periods and monthly, or bi-monthly the remaining time. Sixteen oysters were used for the subsequent analyses in the laboratory. Low mortality was observed during all the experimental period. Gills and mantles were dissected within 1 to 2 h of collection, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 <Superscript>∘</Superscript>C. To monitor the behavior of bivalves directly at the sampling site, 16 oysters placed in a single bag were used for a continuous high-frequency, noninvasive, valve movements recording.</Para>

So, the activity of an oyster is measured every 1.6 s and each day, we obtain 864,000 pairs of data: the time of the measurement and the distance between the two valves. The first electronic card controls the electrodes and the second one manages the data acquisition. The valvometry system uses a GSM/GPRS modem and Linux operating system for the data storage, the Internet access, and the data transmission.</Para>
                <Para>After each 24-h period (or any other programmed period of time), the collected data are transmitted to a workstation server and then inserted in a SQL database, accessible with the software R (R Development Core Team <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2015</CitationRef>) or a text terminal.</Para>
                <Para>An example of valves activity and opening/closing velocity recordings is depicted in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>. As argued in Coudret et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2015</CitationRef>), Schmitt et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">2011</CitationRef>), Sow et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2011</CitationRef>), and Tran et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">2003</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">2010</CitationRef>), pollution can affect the activity of oysters and in particular the shells opening and closing velocities. For instance in an inhospitable extreme environment, oysters behavior will be altered. Thus, detecting extreme changes of the closing speed can provide insights about the health of oysters and so give an insight about the water quality.

                <Para>To detect pollution, the two enzymatic biomarkers glutathione-<Emphasis Type="Italic">S</Emphasis>-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) are considered.</Para>
                <Para>Gills were chosen as the target organ for the GST specific activity determination because of their permanent exchange with environment. They were firstly weighed and homogenized in a sodium phosphate buffer (0.12 M, pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), 1 mM dithiotreitol, 500 mM sucrose, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Roche; 1 tablet for 50 mL buffer). Homogenates were centrifuged (9000g, 20 min, −4 <Superscript>∘</Superscript>C) and the supernatants kept on ice until use. GST specific activity assays were carried out by monitoring the initial velocity of the conjugation of reduced glutathione (GSH) to 1-chloro-2-4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as described by Habig et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">1974</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para>AChE specific activity was determined in the mantle due to its tactile sensory functions via the numerous nerve endings located at the edge and in the pallial zone. Thus, they were firstly weighed and homogenized in a sodium phosphate buffer (0.02 M, pH 7) containing 0.1 % Triton X100 and a protease inhibitor cocktail. Homogenates were centrifuged (16,000g, 20 min, −4 <Superscript>∘</Superscript>C) and the supernatants kept on ice until assays. Specific activity was determined by monitoring the initial velocity of formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate (TNB) from acethylthiocholine and 5,5-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) according to the method described by Ellman et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">1961</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para>In both cases, the total protein concentration in supernatant was measured by the Lowry method (Lowry et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">1951</CitationRef>) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. The GST and AChE specific activities were expressed as moles of product formed per minute and per mg of total proteins. Each measurement was repeated at least twice.</Para>

              <Para>The monitoring of GST and AChE specific activities was undertaken because numerous previous studies evidenced that these enzymes could be undoubtedly used as biomarkers.</Para>
              <Para>Neurotoxic compounds, found in marine environments, provoke severe physiological impairments resulting in a continuous and excessive stimulation of nerve and muscle fibers that derivates in tetany, paralysis, and death (Fulton and Key <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2001</CitationRef>). The relationship between the presence of these hazardous chemical substances in aquatic environments and inhibition of AChE activity in animal tissues is well described (Assis et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2011</CitationRef>; Fulton and Key <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2001</CitationRef>; Nunes <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para>Other hazardous chemical substances, found in aquatic environments, are the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls, which can be monitored via GST activity. This enzyme facilitates the detoxification of a large range of xenobiotic factors (Sheehan et al.<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">2001</CitationRef>; Leiniö and Lehtonen <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2005</CitationRef>) by increasing their hydrophilicity and hence, facilitating their excretion Hoarau et al.<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2002</CitationRef>; Ketterer et al.<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">1983</CitationRef>. The presence of these hazardous substances in aquatic environments is correlated with an increased GST specific activity (Sheehan et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">2001</CitationRef>; Hoarau et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para>Although these biomarkers reflect adverse biological responses to anthropogenic contamination, they can also be related to natural abiotic temporal and spatial variations. Thus, AChE activity is related to water temperature in poikilotherm organisms (Durieux et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2011</CitationRef>). GSTs activity is also reported to be related to water pH, dissolved O<Subscript>2</Subscript> (Robillard et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2003</CitationRef>), and turbidity (Leiniö and Lehtonen <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2005</CitationRef>). Moreover, according to Zanette et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">2011</CitationRef>), salinity notably influences GSTs activity when exposed to contaminants.</Para>
              <Para>Finally, because their causes are multifactorial, the interpretation of AChE and GST specific activity variations on the field is complex. The profiles, obtained over more than a year round study, of gill AChE and mantle GST in <Emphasis Type="Italic">C. gigas</Emphasis> (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>) illustrate this fact. The maximum specific activity of AChE, recorded between July and September 2011, could be interpreted as an indication of a moderate or an absence of exposition to neurotoxic compounds in the area for this period. This response is surprising regarding the elevated human activities in the Gulf and surroundings during summer. Moreover, the successive rises in GST specific activity could be related to transient releases of variable quantities of contaminants into the water. These profiles illustrate the water contamination a posteriori.

              <Para>On the other hand, valvometry is a real-time in situ technique which allows the survey of an aquatic ecosystem. Hence, we performed the comparison of specific enzymatic activities with shell gaping activity of oysters located on the same place in order to determine the correlation between the enzymatic activities and the extreme quantile estimator of the velocity. As the movement speeds are associated to aquatic system perturbations, we consider these movements as an indicator of the animal stress activity. As an example, a stressed oyster due to the presence of pollution or environmental perturbations has irregular and numerous micro-closing and opening periods. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef> shows for the 10th of August 2011 the plot of the 0.999-quantile estimators of the valve closing speed for one oyster at the Locmariaquer site.</Para>
              <Para>To establish dependence between tissular GST and AChE activities and the extreme closing velocity of oysters, we carry out a multiple correspondence analysis. As the correspondence analysis method has to be performed on a set of categorical variables, the variable activities were divided into three classes each containing the same number of individuals using the empirical tercile estimator. The percentage of variability explained in the two first principal components axis is equal to 76.11 <Emphasis Type="Italic">%</Emphasis> of the total variability using the Benzécri criterion (Benzécri <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">1992</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para>Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef> reveals three clusters, each including one of the three classes of each variable. In the first cluster in the middle right, high GST and low AChE specific activities classes (meaning a possible pollution) are grouped with the lowest extreme closing velocity class. On the contrary, the second cluster in the left bottom includes low GST and high AChE specific activities classes (meaning an absence of pollution) and a high extreme closing velocity class. The last cluster in the top left corresponds to the medium classes of the three variables. The supposed welfare of oysters in the absence of pollution may be expressed by a high activity of their valves allowing a large access to oxygen and nutrients in water. Conversely, stressed oysters tend to the confinement by reducing their valves velocity to limit the contact with an unfavorable environment. In addition, the presence of neurotoxic compounds may alter the neuromuscular synapsis which could warrant for both the observed adductor muscle slowing down and the large number of micro-closings which characterize the cluster associated to a pollution for 90 <Emphasis Type="Italic">%</Emphasis> of oysters (data not shown). A similar behavior has been observed by Tran et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">2010</CitationRef>) in the presence of harmful algae <Emphasis Type="Italic">Alexandrium minutum</Emphasis>.

              <Heading>Summary and conclusion</Heading>
              <Para>We have studied the dependence between all the tissular enzymatic specific activities GST and AChE and high-frequency valvometry using extreme modeling method and multivariate visualisation. We showed this dependence between high-frequency valvometry data with two enzymatic biomarkers in relation to environmental variations. The results show a strong dependence between the extremal activity of oysters and the putative presence or absence of various xenobiotics.</Para>
              <Para>This study has allowed reaching two goals: firstly, to validate the relation between extreme closing velocities and metabolic biochemical status of the animals; secondly, to obtain a sufficient large range of enzymatic data set to allow calibration for estimating the animal’s welfare from data which cannot be a priori normalized. Our qualitative study shows that valvometry can be used to provide in situ relevant instant diagnostic of the bivalves’ behavior and thus appears to be an effective, early warning tool in ecological risk assessment and marine environment monitoring.</Para>
