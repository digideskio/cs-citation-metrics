          <Section1 ID="Sec1" Type="Introduction">
            <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par2" TextBreak="No">The punch line for a much-repeated lay persons’ joke about surgeons is, “Oh that’s God; he’s just pretending to be a surgeon”. The unique demands on surgeons – the ability to act decisively even when data are limited, the necessity to improvise when unexpected situations occur, and excellent eye-hand coordination – created somewhat of a mythical aura about surgeons. Surgery as a profession has also been closely linked to the battlefield and the armed forces. Up until the late twentieth century, these influences often reinforced the so-called ‘surgical personality’, one which is overbearing, hierarchical, and frequently treats subordinates in an abusive manner. Given the dictate for ‘managing the ship’ of the operating room, the need for quick compliance with orders and intolerance of delay reinforced these attributes, this behavior was tolerated. It has become clear over the last few decades, however, that the best surgical outcomes are associated with good teamwork and a flattening of the hierarchy within a surgical team. This concept has been reinforced with introduction of crew resource management techniques into the operating theater, ‘sign-ins’ which introduce all participants to one another, ‘time-outs’ to identify potential errors in the making, and an acknowledgement that all members of the team should have the ability to ‘stop the line’ should problems occur. Self-defining characteristics of surgeons – to do what is necessary within time constraints, to project a calming confidence under stressful conditions and the ability to rise to the occasion are still necessary, but the brash and arrogant caricature is no longer necessary nor desired.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par3" TextBreak="No">Nevertheless, and as in all areas of human interaction, multiple personality types exist in the surgical environment. Within a group – team, section, division, or department – many different personalities will co-exist and need to be managed effectively by leadership. These personality types, when carried to the extreme, may result in ‘difficult’ or ‘disruptive’ members of the team. Numerous different classification systems attempt to categorize personality types. One such system is the Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator®, which identifies 16 specific types of personalities. Each of these types has a different outlook on life and way of dealing with issues. From the leader’s standpoint, when hiring decisions are being made, the underlying personality of the individual must be taken into consideration. An incredible curriculum vitae and list of accomplishments are enticing in a potential recruit, but a personality that doesn’t mix well with others on the existing team is a recipe for disaster. Background and reference checks specifically asking about interpersonal interactions are important when considering a new hire, as one of the most time-consuming, and least productive, aspects of a leader’s job is moderating disputes among team members who ‘can’t play together in the sandbox’.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par4" TextBreak="No">For those in leadership positions, it is also important to understand the local institution’s by-laws on rules governing behavior – most state that practitioners must “adhere strictly to the ethics of their …. professions, to work cooperatively with others ….” and that the member may be considered for removal were he or she to act in ways that …. “are believed to be detrimental to patient safety or inconsistent with the efficient delivery of patient care” (Northwestern Memorial Hospital Bylaws). Finally, leaders should understand that if team members cross the line into the category of ‘disruptive’ that all subsequent dealings with the individual should be documented and records be maintained for future considerations.</Para>

            <Heading>‘Difficult’ Team Members and a Leader’s Response</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par5" TextBreak="No">Multiple different personality types will undoubtedly populate any team or group of which one is a member. Leaders must learn how to best manage these personalities. That management style is necessarily dependent on the specific situation, the number of people in the group, and the group’s purpose. A leader must rely on his or her emotional intelligence and experience to navigate these sometimes tricky personality waters. In Chap. <ExternalRef>
                <RefSource>6</RefSource>
                <RefTarget Address="10.1007/978-3-319-11107-0_6" TargetType="DOI"/>
              </ExternalRef> the concept of emotional intelligence was explored. The leader may need to call upon self awareness, social awareness, self regulation and, certainly, social skill in dealing with the difficult team member. Furthermore, as discussed in Chap. <ExternalRef>
                <RefSource>4</RefSource>
                <RefTarget Address="10.1007/978-3-319-11107-0_4" TargetType="DOI"/>
              </ExternalRef>, there are at least six leadership styles that can be invoked in any given situation. It has been said that a successful leader will use the different leadership styles as a professional golfer uses the clubs in the bag, choosing clubs based on the demands of the particular shot [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par6" TextBreak="No">There are several specific personality types that may negatively impact a team. Those with difficult personalities have developed their traits over years and generally learn that they can wear down others to ultimately get what they want. The leader must identify specific personality characteristics, realize the ways in which these attributes may complicate the functioning of a team, and learn techniques that may temper the expression of these traits. The passive-aggressive personality type may undercut the leader’s authority by sniping, using sarcasm, and engaging in non-playful teasing. These individuals generally don’t like being the center of attention, however, and don’t like open confrontation. A strategy that may work with them is to redirect their attention to the issues rather than to other team members, and ask them to come up with specific action items to contribute to the team’s activities. A second, easily recognizable personality type is the chronic whiner (‘Eeyore’), who sees the glass as always half empty, points out the difficulty in every opportunity and blames others for every problem that arises – “I told you so” is their common refrain. The leader must stay positive, but realistic, with these individuals and be quick to point out positive outcomes from decisions made by the team. Diametrically opposed to the negative personality types are those who always try to please others, over-committing themselves and unable to give an honest opinion when the observation is not positive or popular. The leader must carefully delegate tasks to these individuals, help them learn how to say ‘no’, and specifically call them out to give candid opinions when the facts are unfavorable. There are also those who are unresponsive and disengaged and who refuse to reveal their true motives. They often will not participate in a formal meeting and reveal little about themselves. These people must be drawn out to participate in group meetings. Finally there is the traditional ‘surgical personality’ who is hostile, abusive, domineering and arrogant. These individuals can engage in bullying activities and must be treated differently than the remainder of those mentioned above.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par7" TextBreak="No">As a leader, it is important to understand that each of us has the capacity to demonstrate some of the above behaviors on any given day. The expression of our personalities may be impacted by events taking place in our personal lives or in other arenas – leaders must work diligently to not allow these extrinsic factors to negatively impact their dynamics with members of their team. This requires emotional intelligence and the targeted ability to blunt one’s own emotional responses. The basic response of a leader to the aforementioned difficult individuals is not to take the interactions personally and to realize that you really cannot change the underlying personality type. What you <Emphasis Type="Underline">can</Emphasis> change is your response to the individual, <Emphasis Type="Underline">your</Emphasis> attitude toward them, and <Emphasis Type="Underline">your</Emphasis> behavior. Remember that for others, too, an untoward personal situation may underlie the personality type being expressed and empathy can sometimes be used to de-escalate an explosive situation. Make it clear that you respect the individual, but you also expect to be treated with respect in return. One highly charged word that should probably be avoided during a difficult interaction is ‘attitude’ – this is a subjective term and the leader should instead focus on the behavior of the individual. Ultimately the leader must try to understand the different personalities existing in one’s team and learn to manage to their strengths.</Para>

            <Heading>Disruptive Team Members</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par8" TextBreak="No">The difficult personality types referred to above can slow down progress within an organization and give the leader headaches. However, a different class of difficult team members is that of the <Emphasis Type="Underline">disruptive</Emphasis> member who must be specifically identified and managed separately. The term <Emphasis Type="Italic">disruptive physician</Emphasis> is defined as those who exhibit abusive behavior that “interferes with patient care or could reasonably be expected to interfere with the process of delivering quality care” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. Lucian Leape has described many different examples of disruptive behavior [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. When reading through the specific behaviors characteristic of disruptive physicians, many match the definition of the ‘surgical personality’ of old. These include outbursts of anger, throwing instruments, demeaning behavior, sexual comments or innuendo, negative comments about other physicians’ care, but may also include unethical or dishonest behavior. This type of behavior is associated with an increased likelihood of errors by the healthcare team [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. These behaviors make those around them try to avoid the disruptive physician, hesitate to make suggestions about patient care or deflect their attention from the patient. This disruptive behavior also has a potent negative effect on morale within the healthcare team, making life for others around them, particularly those lower in the pecking order, miserable and more likely to disengage. Disruptive behavior has been shown to be associated with higher turnover among nursing and technical support staff in the medical setting [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par9" TextBreak="No">Surgical leaders must strive to identify disruptive team members and deal with them appropriately. Identification of these individuals can be complicated by those around them being intimidated and not wishing to draw attention to themselves by such reporting. Disruptive behavior may be identified in online event tracking systems, by unusual events described in the Morbidity and Mortality system or during a sentinel event disclosure. Gerald Hickson and his group from Vanderbilt have written extensively about the identification of problematic disruptive physicians by their association with increased numbers of unsolicited patient complaints [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par10" TextBreak="No">Whereas the interpersonal behavior of all people may lapse from time to time, it is estimated that approximately 3–5 % of physicians demonstrate persistent patterns of disruptive performance [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. These disruptive outbursts occur most frequently in high stress areas of the medical care environment, such as emergency departments, intensive care units and operating rooms. Once a disruptive physician is identified, there must be a defined response. Leaders must promote excellent care in an environment that fosters quality. They need to understand, develop, and implement fair, reliable processes for addressing questions about behavior, performance and outcomes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par11" TextBreak="No">The first goal in addressing disruptive behavior is to truly understand the situation by obtaining enough event-related data to ascertain reliability. There are always two sides to any story. If there has been a single unprofessional incident, an informal ‘cup of coffee’ conversation is the most reasonable reaction by leadership or by someone designated by the leader [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. This conversation informs the individual that the behavior was both noticed and was unprofessional and does not adhere to the team’s standards. Recurring patterns of disruptive behavior must be addressed with more formal interventions. The short term goal is to help the disruptive team member achieve insight into the negative aspects of his/her behavior. The long term goal is to restore professional conduct and eliminate the disruptive behavior.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par12" TextBreak="No">Hickson’s group has developed a pyramidal, tiered, system of intervention that starts with a level 1 “awareness” intervention when recurring unprofessional events are identified [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. I believe it is the leader’s role to be directly involved, usually solo, at this stage. At this meeting the data suggesting the pattern of disruptive behavior are discussed in order for the individual to gain insight into his/her actions, and a clear expectation of altered behavior is expressed. After the meeting, a letter is written to the disruptive surgeon outlining the purpose and outcome of the meeting, and a copy is placed in the employment file.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par13" TextBreak="No">If the awareness intervention does not have the desired results and a pattern of disruptive behavior persists, the situation is elevated to a level 2 “guided” intervention by authority [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. I have found it helpful to involve the hospital’s Chief Medical Officer in a formal discussion with the offender at this stage of intervention. This meeting must be carefully planned out in advance, keeping in mind your desired outcomes/objectives and the talking points that will be addressed by each person. Usually, the disruptive individual is referred for evaluation in our physician wellness program to assess for underlying causative factors and/or for psychological assessment and counseling (e.g. anger management interventions).</Para>
            <Para ID="Par14" TextBreak="No">Finally, should the individual show no change in his/her behavior, level 3 intervention is required, which is a disciplinary action that follows organizational policies and procedures [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. The resources of the institution are brought to bear at this point, and may ultimately lead to restriction of duties or dismissal, with reporting to the appropriate governmental agencies.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par15" TextBreak="No">It is mandatory that throughout this process adequate records are maintained that document the progressive steps. Remember that there are at least six potential audiences for any such written records: the physician under review, the physician’s attorney, future leaders of the health system, the defense counsel, the judge, and the local newspaper. Disciplinary action with formal investigations and a reporting to the National Database is the least favorable outcome and all attempts should be made to restore the disruptive team member to a good professional standing.</Para>

          <Section1 ID="Sec4">
            <Heading>The Impaired Team Member</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par16" TextBreak="No">The term ‘impaired’ has been defined by the American Medical Association as a disability resulting from psychiatric illness, alcoholism, or drug dependence. The prevalence of these impairments in physicians is likely equal to or greater than that of the general population given they are often associated with fatigue, stress, and/or easy access to drugs. There are no good studies assessing the incidence of physical illness among practicing surgeons, and surgeons are not immune to cognitive and/or technical decline with aging [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. When all of the above conditions are considered, it is estimated that one quarter to one third of all physicians will experience, at some time in their career, a period of time during which they have a condition that impairs their ability to practice medicine safely [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Physician leaders must bear in mind that unusual or disruptive behavior may be the outward manifestation of impairment in a surgeon, be willing to confront the issues rationally, and be aware of the local resources for investigation and management. The impaired physician usually is identified by those around them noticing unusual or atypical behavior. Per hospital by-laws, a urine or blood test for alcohol and/or drugs may be ordered immediately. Most physician health programs mandate the impaired physician to undergo a treatment program with subsequent routine monitoring as a condition of reinstating hospital privileges and medical licensure. When returning to active practice after a period away, the surgeon should be entered into a focused professional practice evaluation system with close monitoring the first few months.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par17" TextBreak="No">Identifying the team member, particularly a surgeon, whose physical or mental capabilities have declined due to aging, may be difficult. Many surgeons are passionate about their profession and have not developed interests outside of the hospital, so resist the concept of retirement. The majority of health systems do not have mandatory retirement ages nor do they routinely assess competence as physicians age. Part of this laissez-faire attitude may be due to concerns about age discrimination legal actions. Should concerns be raised about a surgeon’s competence due to aging (or any other cause of physical or mental decline) the individual should undergo testing to assess both cognitive and manual skills functions.</Para>

            <Heading>Conclusions</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par18" TextBreak="No">Academic leaders must learn to work with multiple personality types. These include team members whose personalities have the potential to interfere with team dynamics.
