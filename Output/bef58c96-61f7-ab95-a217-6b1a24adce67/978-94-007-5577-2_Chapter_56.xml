              <Para>A three-dimensional chemical transport model (CTM), PMCAMx-2008, was applied to Europe to study the influence of emissions changes on fine PM levels. Various emissions scenarios were studied, covering summer and winter periods to quantify also the seasonal variation. Reduction of NH<Subscript>3</Subscript> emissions seems to be the most effective control strategy for reducing PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> over Europe, in both seasons, mainly due to reduction of NH<Subscript>4</Subscript>NO<Subscript>3</Subscript>. A reduction of SO<Subscript>2</Subscript> emissions has a significant effect on PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> levels over the Balkans during summer, due to decrease of sulfate, while the reduction of anthropogenic OA emissions has a strong effect on total OA mainly in areas close to emissions sources. The NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions control strategy seems to be problematic in both seasons. Our analysis in European Megacities, based on a scenario zeroing all anthropogenic emissions, showed that the contribution of local emissions on total PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript>, depends on the chemical component, with local sources being especially important mainly for black carbon (BC).</Para>

              <Para>Air pollution is one of the challenging environmental problems in Europe since particulate matter (PM), ozone and other pollutants often exceed the air quality limits, having adverse effects on human health, climate change and visibility [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00563">3</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>In order to improve air quality in Europe we need to quantify how gaseous and particulate pollutants respond to emissions changes of their precursors and in which extend major urban area emissions impact local and regional air quality. For this purpose we applied a three-dimensional chemical transport model (PMCAMx-2008) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00562">2</CitationRef>] which can accurately and efficiently describe the physical and chemical transformations of gas and aerosol species. PMCAMx-2008 includes state-of-the-art organic and inorganic aerosol modules which make it well suited to quantify the response of the system to emission controls.</Para>

              <Para>PMCAMx-2008 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00562">2</CitationRef>] simulates the processes of horizontal and vertical advection, horizontal and vertical dispersion, wet and dry deposition, and gas-phase chemistry. The model includes a state-of-the-art organic aerosol module which is based on the volatility basis set framework [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00561">1</CitationRef>]. PMCAMx-2008simulates the partitioning of primary emissions assuming primary organic aerosol to be semivolatile. Nine surrogate POA species with effective saturation concentrations at 298 K ranging from 10<Superscript>−2</Superscript> to 10<Superscript>6</Superscript> μg m<Superscript>−3</Superscript> are used. The model treats all organic species (primary and secondary) as chemically reactive. Chemical aging through gas-phase oxidation of OA vapors is also simulated.</Para>
              <Para>The model was applied over Europe covering a 5,400 × 5,832 km<Superscript>2</Superscript> region with 36 × 36 km grid resolution and 14 vertical layers. The necessary meteorological inputs were taken using the meteorological model WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00564">4</CitationRef>]. In addition updated anthropogenic [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00565">5</CitationRef>] and biogenic gridded hourly emission fields were developed for gases and primary particulate matter.</Para>

              <Para>To study the response of fine particulate matter (PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript>) to emissions changes, we performed a sensitivity analysis reducing the emissions of the major gaseous precursors (SO<Subscript>2</Subscript>, NH<Subscript>3</Subscript>, NO<Subscript>x</Subscript>, anthropogenic VOCs) by 50 %. A 50 % reduction of anthropogenic primary OA emissions (POA) was also studied. In addition, a special focus was given to European Megacities (Paris, London, Rhine-Ruhr, and Po Valley), exploring their contribution in their air quality as well as the impact that they have on the surrounding regions. For this purpose, we applied hypothetical “annihilation” scenarios, zeroing all the anthropogenic emissions of Megacities. Different simulation periods were used representing summer and winter to quantify also the seasonal variation.</Para>

              <Para>The reduction of NH<Subscript>3</Subscript> emissions by 50 % seems to be the most effective control strategy in reducing PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript>, in both periods (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00561">56.1</InternalRef>), mainly due to a significant decrease of ammonium nitrate. During summer, NH<Subscript>3</Subscript> emissions reduction resulted in a decrease of ammonium nitrate by 22 % in the entire model domain. The highest reduction is predicted in UK and Southwest Europe where ammonium nitrate is reduced by 35 and 31 %, while the corresponding decrease of total PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> in these areas was 15 and 10 % respectively. Similarly in winter, ammonium nitrate is decreased by 22 %. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00561">

              <Para>The 50 % reduction of SO<Subscript>2</Subscript> emissions, during the summer, leads to a significant decrease of sulfate in the entire domain (23 % on average). The SO<Subscript>2</Subscript> control strategy is more effective over the Balkans where sulfate is reduced by 30 %, while the respective decrease of total PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> was 10 %. Additionally in winter, sulfate is also reduced (15 % on average) although its decrease is lower because its formation was limited by H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O<Subscript>2</Subscript> availability.</Para>
              <Para>The 50 % reduction of anthropogenic VOCs and POA produced a decrease of total OA concentration in both periods with the POA control strategy being more effective in areas close to emissions sources. By reducing VOCs emissions, total OA is predicted to decrease in the whole domain, by 8 % during summer and 4 % in winter, while the respective average decrease of total OA after the 50 % reduction of POA emissions was 15 % during winter and 8 % in the summer.</Para>
              <Para>The NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions control strategy seems to be problematic in both periods. During the summer, the 50 % reduction of NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions leads to an increase of ozone levels, mainly in the major urban areas such as London, Paris and Madrid (up to 40 %), and also over Western Europe (4 % on average). Additionally, in the winter, the reduction of NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions results in an increase of sulfate and total OA by 8 and 12 % respectively.</Para>
              <Para>The results from the Megacities “annihilation” scenarios showed that the impact of local emissions on total PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> levels is quite variable depending on location, time and chemical component. In Po Valley, total PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> was found to be largely local in both periods (over 50 % in summer and more than 60 % during winter), while in Paris and Rhine-Ruhr the contribution of local sources is also significant mainly during winter. On the contrary, London emissions have a smaller effect on local PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> and long range transport of pollutants often dominates.</Para>
              <Para>In addition, local emissions are especially important for black carbon (BC) levels in all the European Megacities. In both periods more than 40 % of BC is found to originate from local sources, while in Paris and Po Valley the contribution of local emissions to BC levels during summer, exceeds 60 and 80 % respectively (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00562">56.2</InternalRef>). At the same time, Megacities do not influence only their air quality, but their impacts extend to the surrounding regions several hundred kilometres away from the source. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00562">

              <Para>The analysis we performed to quantify how total PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> levels respond to emissions changes of their precursors, using PMCAMx-2008 showed that reduction of NH<Subscript>3</Subscript> emissions could be an effective control strategy for reducing PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> in Europe, in both periods. The reduction of SO<Subscript>2</Subscript> emissions has a significant effect on PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> levels over the Balkans during summertime, while reduction of anthropogenic VOCs and POA emissions will reduce total OA, especially in areas close to emissions sources. On the other hand reduction of NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions does not seem to be effective for reducing PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> levels.</Para>
              <Para>Our findings from the “annihilation” scenario of Megacities anthropogenic emissions, suggest that the influence of local sources on the concentration of total PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> varies by space, time and the chemical component. Local sources are more significant for primary aerosol species like BC, while they do not only impact their air quality but their impacts extend to the surrounding regions.</Para>

              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: You concluded that NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emission control alone was a bad idea in Europe. In winter, the O<Subscript>3</Subscript> concentration increased widely but does this matter if O<Subscript>3</Subscript> is well below O<Subscript>3</Subscript> concentration limits anyway?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: One of the objectives of this study was to examine how effective emissions reductions of the major precursors could be for reducing fine particulate matter levels and subsequently for improving European air quality. Indeed, during wintertime the predicted increase of O<Subscript>3</Subscript> levels was below O<Subscript>3</Subscript> concentration limits but the 50 % reduction of NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions alone lead also to a significant increase of sulfate and OA levels in most areas of the domain. Taking also account that during summer, O<Subscript>3</Subscript> is predicted to increase up to 40 % in the major European cities (e.g. Paris, London, Madrid) and also in Western Europe, we concluded that a reduction of NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions on its own seems to be a bad idea for improving air quality in Europe.</SimplePara>

              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: What is the impact of reduced ammonia emissions on the NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> concentrations? It was this in the expected concentration enhancement?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: The main focus on this study was on fine particulate matter and their corresponding response to emissions changes in Europe. Thus, we gave little attention to the predicted concentration changes on gaseous species like NO<Subscript>2</Subscript>. Nevertheless, from results we predicted small increases on NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> levels after the reduction of NH<Subscript>3</Subscript> emissions but without any further analysis.</SimplePara>
