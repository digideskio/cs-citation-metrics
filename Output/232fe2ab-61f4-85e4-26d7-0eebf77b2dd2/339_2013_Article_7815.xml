The efficiency of the solar cells increases with the increasing H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratio, which is attributed to a high spectral response mainly in the long-wavelength range and the consequent enhancement of short-circuit current. A high-efficiency a-Si:H/μc-Si:H tandem solar cell of 10 % was achieved.

              <Para>Boron doped zinc oxide (ZnO:B) films are widely used as transparent conductive oxide (TCO) electrodes in high efficiency silicon thin film solar cells due to their good optical and electrical properties as well as rough surface structures [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. In addition, ZnO:B films are applied as an intermediate reflective layer as a SiO<Subscript>
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">x</Emphasis>
                </Subscript> layer to enhance the light absorption [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. Several research groups have systematically investigated the influences of deposition temperature, process pressure, doping concentration and film thickness on the ZnO:B films prepared by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>] and atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. The optical and electrical properties, grain structure and morphology are strongly dependent on these deposition conditions. In the mean time, the performances of solar cells strongly relied on these properties of ZnO:B films like morphology, light scattering and absorption when they are applied in silicon thin film solar cells as front electrodes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. In addition, Ding et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>] reported LPCVD ZnO bilayers obtained by changing the doping level especially for application in silicon thin film solar cells and high photogenerated currents were achieved. Recently, the flow ratio of water to diethyl zinc (H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ) was reported to tune the morphology and electrical properties of LPCVD ZnO:B films as front electrodes of the silicon thin film solar cells [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. The morphology varies from small grains with a few larger pyramidal grains to large pyramidal grains and then to slightly smaller pyramidal grains with the increasing H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio from 0.9 to 5.2. However, different variations of morphology and other optical and electrical properties of ZnO:B films different from the observations in the literature [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>] were observed by us even though similar deposition conditions were employed, which may be related with diluted gas and carrier gas, hydrogen (H<Subscript>2</Subscript>). Furthermore, all LPCVD ZnO:B films here were applied in hydrogenated amorphous silicon/microcrystalline silicon tandem solar cells (a-Si:H/μc-Si:H) as front electrodes. It is found that the ZnO:B films deposited at H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratios of more than 1 can provide a high light trapping effect and a good solar cell performance.</Para>
              <Para>In this study, the influence of the flow ratio of H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ on LPCVD ZnO:B films is systematically investigated. Optical and electrical properties, crystallographic orientation and morphology of the ZnO:B films were characterized by spectrophotometry, Hall effect, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) measurements.</Para>

              <Para>The ZnO:B films were prepared on 3.2 mm large area float glasses (1.1 m×1.3 m) by the LPVCD technique (TCO 1200 from Oerlikon Solar company). H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O and DEZ were used as main precursor gases and evaporated in individual evaporation tanks. The temperature for DEZ and H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O bubblers in the tanks was about 60 °C. The H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratio was changed from 0.6 to 1.4 by reducing the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O vapor flow while keeping the DEZ flow constant (2700 sccm). Hydrogen-diluted diborane (B<Subscript>2</Subscript>H<Subscript>6</Subscript>) gas was used as doping resource and the B<Subscript>2</Subscript>H<Subscript>6</Subscript>/DEZ flow ratio was kept at 0.08. In addition, more pure H<Subscript>2</Subscript> gas (550 sccm) was input to accelerate the internal thermal balance during the reaction. The thicknesses of ZnO:B films at different H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratios are between 1130 nm and 1740 nm. The substrate temperature was controlled at around 150 °C by heating with resistance wires. The working pressure was 0.5 mbar. These LPCVD ZnO:B films were applied in a-Si:H/μc-Si:H solar cells as front electrodes. The thicknesses of intrinsic a-Si:H and μc-Si:H layers were 180 nm and 850 nm, respectively. The same LPCVD ZnO:B films with a slightly heavy doping level were used as back electrodes for all solar cells. A thin SiO<Subscript>

              <Para>The thicknesses of the ZnO:B films were measured by an optical test system (XYT v1.1 from Oerlikon Solar company). The morphologies of the ZnO:B films were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S4800). The crystallographic orientation was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement in the Bragg–Brentano geometry (<Emphasis Type="Italic">θ</Emphasis>–2<Emphasis Type="Italic">θ</Emphasis>). Cu K<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis> X-rays (1.5418 Å) were produced under an accelerating voltage of 30 kV and a current of 40 mA. The electrical properties were checked by Hall measurement using the Van der Pauw configuration at room temperature. The optical properties of the ZnO:B films and solar cells involving total transmission (TT), diffuse transmission (DT) and total reflection (TR) were measured by a spectrophotometer mounted with an integrating sphere (Perkin Elmer Lambda 950). The light scattering property, i.e. haze, was defined as DT/TT.

                <Para>Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef> shows the morphologies of the ZnO:B films prepared at different H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratios from 0.6 to 1.4. The thicknesses of the ZnO:B films at different H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratios are as follows: 1130 nm (0.6), 1460 nm (0.8), 1680 nm (1.0), 1740 nm (1.2) and 1720 nm (1.4). When the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio is 0.6, the ZnO:B films show a small and long leaf-shape topography as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>a. The small and long leaf-shape morphology turns into a similar leaf-shape but large morphology when the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio is increased to 0.8 as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>b. Differently, the morphology of ZnO:B films is varied from leaf-shape to tetragonal or pyramidal surface structures as the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio increases to 1.0 as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>c. Furthermore, when the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio increases to 1.2 and 1.4, the ZnO:B films show pyramid surface structures with larger tetragonal grains as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>d, which were observed by other researchers [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Even though the film thickness affects the feature size of surface structures to some extent, the corresponding shapes of surface structures will not change. Note that the SEM image of the ZnO:B films grown at an H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio of 1.2 is not shown here. However, it was reported that an even higher H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio would lead to small-size pyramidal morphologies and a low light scattering as well as other different electrical and optical properties [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. It was also reported that the process pressure and doping gas can lead to different sizes of surface structures other than the grain shape [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. Furthermore, the substrate temperature is an important deposition condition to fabricate ZnO:B films with different types of morphologies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. Low substrate temperature (130 °C) leads to the formation of relatively flat ZnO:B films with small grains [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Then the morphology varies from small grains with a few large-size pyramidal grains to large-size pyramidal grains when the substrate temperature increases from 146 °C to 164 °C. Then it changes to relatively small pyramidal grains and disordered shapes as the substrate temperature increases from 180°C to 236 °C [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Such a change in morphology could be due to the thermal kinetic energies of the molecules on the surface as well as different preferential growth directions in the films at different growth temperatures. Nicolay et al. observed that the morphology varies from small grains with a few larger pyramidal grains to large pyramidal grains and then to slightly smaller pyramidal grains with increasing H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio from 0.9 to 5.2 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. Such an observation in variation of morphology at H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratios from 0.9 to 1.15 in the literature [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>] is different from what we mentioned above, which could be due to the inputting of the H<Subscript>2</Subscript> acted as diluted gas in the B<Subscript>2</Subscript>H<Subscript>6</Subscript> mixture gas and carrier gas mentioned in the experimental section. In Ref. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>], 1 % B<Subscript>2</Subscript>H<Subscript>6</Subscript> in argon was used and its flow was adapted to achieve a similar carrier concentration while 2 % B<Subscript>2</Subscript>H<Subscript>6</Subscript> in H<Subscript>2</Subscript> is kept constant here and in the mean time H<Subscript>2</Subscript> gas of 550 sccm was added to accelerate the internal thermal balance inside the reaction chamber during the film growth. The H<Subscript>2</Subscript> may affect the growth of ZnO:B films to some extent. The exact cause is not clear so far and deep investigations of such a kind of influence will be carried out in the near future. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig2">

                <Para>ZnO:B films deposited at different H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratios show different electrical properties as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef>. As shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef>a, the resistivity first drastically decreases by one order of magnitude from 2.3×10<Superscript>−2</Superscript> Ω cm to 2.1×10<Superscript>−3</Superscript> Ω cm when the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratio increases from 0.6 to 1.0. As the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratio increases further from 1.0 to 1.4, the resistivity slightly increases from 2.1×10<Superscript>−3</Superscript> Ω cm to 2.6×10<Superscript>−3</Superscript> Ω cm. Note that the sheet resistances for the ZnO:B films at different H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratios are as follows: 170 Ω (0.6), 13.3 Ω (0.8), 12 Ω (1.0), 13.4 Ω (1.2) and 15 Ω (1.4). The carrier concentration increases from 5.83×10<Superscript>19</Superscript> cm<Superscript>−3</Superscript> to 10×10<Superscript>19</Superscript> cm<Superscript>−3</Superscript> when the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratio increases further from 0.6 to 0.8 and then reduces to 7.9×10<Superscript>19</Superscript> cm<Superscript>−3</Superscript> for the further increasing of the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratio to 1.4. The first increase in carrier concentration could be attributed to more excited interstitial zinc atoms. However, a high H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio of more than 0.8 might lead to reductions in both interstitial zinc atoms and oxygen vacancies, which are in general beneficial to the carrier concentration. As a result, the carrier concentration slightly decreases for a relatively high H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio in this case as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef>b. As to the mobility, it increases from around 4.6 cm<Superscript>2</Superscript>/V s to 35 cm<Superscript>2</Superscript>/Vs when the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratio increases further from 0.6 to 1.0 and then slightly decreases to around 30 cm<Superscript>2</Superscript>/V s with further increasing of the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratio to 1.4. The first enhancement in mobility could be due to a decrease in the scattering by the grain boundaries because of large-size grains as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>b. However, more oxygen atoms might be chemically absorbed in the grain boundaries as defects at a high H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio of more than 1 and then cause a decrease in mobility as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef>b. Moreover, it was reported that a very high H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratio could lead to formation of small-size grains and consequently a low mobility for the ZnO:B films [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig4">

                <Para>Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig5">5</InternalRef> shows the TT and DT of the ZnO:B films deposited at the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratios of 0.6–1.4. The ZnO:B film deposited at an H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio of 0.6 shows a high TT over the whole wavelength range due to a low carrier concentration as mentioned above. When the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio increases to more than 0.8 the TT reduces because of a high light absorption by the free carriers. In addition, the TT curves vary from wavy shapes to smooth curves due to light scattering by the rough surfaces of the ZnO:B films. The wavy shapes, i.e. interference fringes of the TT for the ZnO:B films at the low H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratios, could be due to the relatively flat surface structures as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>. Moreover, there exists a very slight Burstein–Moss shift in the absorption-edge region of TT in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig5">5</InternalRef> due to different carrier concentrations. However, such a shift for the absorption edge of TT is not consistent with the change in carrier concentrations (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef>) due to the influence of the film thickness on TT. The DT increases with increasing H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio, which is in accordance with the variation of haze as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">6</InternalRef>. The ZnO:B film deposited at H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratios of 1.2 and 1.4 shows almost the same TT and DT. The inserted figure in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">6</InternalRef> shows that the haze value at 600 nm increases from 1.9 % to about 28 % with increasing H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio. All the observations in optical properties accord with the variations of morphologies of ZnO:B films as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>. It should be noted that small-size grains formed at a very high H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratio lead to a low haze [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig5">

It is found that the efficiency increases with increasing H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio and then reaches a relatively constant value (10 %) when the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio is more than 1.2. The enhancement in efficiency is mainly attributed to the increase of the short-circuit current (<Emphasis Type="Italic">J</Emphasis>

                  <Subscript>OC</Subscript> and FF of single μc-Si:H solar cells decrease with increasing H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio due to a high defect density caused by the sharper pyramidal surface of the ZnO:B front electrodes.

In addition, even though the sheet resistance of ZnO:B films may influence FF of the solar cells to some extent, it was not observed here, which may be due to different matching states of the top and bottom currents for the top and bottom sub-cells as well as the quality of silicon materials as mentioned above. As to the increase of <Emphasis Type="Italic">J</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>SC</Subscript>, it is due to a good light trapping effect inside the solar cells with the rough ZnO:B films as front electrodes as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>. The maximum <Emphasis Type="Italic">J</Emphasis>

                <Para>Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig8">8</InternalRef> shows the light absorptions of a-Si:H/μc-Si:H tandem solar cells and the spectral responses for the top a-Si:H cells and bottom μc-Si:H cells tested by EQE measurements. The light absorption of a-Si:H/μc-Si:H tandem solar cells shows a clear increase, in particular in the long-wavelength range, with increasing H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio from 0.6 to 1.2 and then reaches saturation. Such an observation could be caused by different light scattering effects of the ZnO:B films with different-roughness surface structures. Moreover, even though the carrier concentration of the ZnO:B film at an H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio of 0.6 is relatively small (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef>), the light harvesting at longer wavelengths is still low for the tandem solar cells here. It seems that such an effect is weaker compared to the light scattering effect for the ZnO:B film in this case. Corresponding to these absorption curves, the tandem solar cells show an enhanced spectral response (SR) at long wavelengths of 600–1000 nm and resulting high <Emphasis Type="Italic">J</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>SC</Subscript> values for the bottom solar cells as shown in Figs. <InternalRef RefID="Fig8">8</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Fig9">9</InternalRef>. As to the low SR at short wavelengths of 400–500 nm and the low <Emphasis Type="Italic">J</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>SC</Subscript> values for the top cells as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig8">8</InternalRef>, it could be due to a relatively thicker p-layer grown on the relatively smooth ZnO:B front electrodes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. In addition, the low light scattering effect by the smooth ZnO:B front electrodes could also lead to a low SR at wavelengths of 500–800 nm for the top cells. As shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig9">9</InternalRef>, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">J</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>SC</Subscript> values for both top and bottom cells increase with increasing H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio and reach saturated values in this study here. Moreover, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">J</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>SC</Subscript> values of top cells are higher than those of bottom cells for individual tandem solar cells, which means that the current matching status for top and bottom cells could be optimized further to enhance the efficiency of the tandem solar cells.

              <Para>ZnO:B films were deposited at different H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratios from 0.6 to 1.4 by the LPCVD technique. The morphology varies from small leaf-like to pyramidal surface structures with the increasing H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratios. Relatively high H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratios lead to a highly rough surface structure and consequently a high light scattering property. A high haze value of up to 28 % was achieved at the H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratios of 1.2 and 1.4. The efficiency of a-Si:H/μc-Si:H solar cells increases with increasing H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ flow ratio, which is mainly attributed to a high SR especially in the long-wavelength range and the consequent enhancement of <Emphasis Type="Italic">J</Emphasis>
                <Subscript>SC</Subscript>. A high efficiency of 10 % was achieved for the a-Si:H/μc-Si:H tandem solar cells with the rough ZnO:B front electrodes. The H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O/DEZ ratio is an important process parameter to tune the material properties of LPCVD ZnO:B films as well as the device performances of corresponding silicon thin film solar cells.</Para>
