              <Para TextBreak="No">This handbook has provided a comprehensive overview of the growing clinical research evidence related to the emerging transdisciplinary field of occupational health and wellness.

              <Para TextBreak="No">This Handbook has provided a comprehensive overview of the growing clinical research evidence related to the emerging transdisciplinary field of occupational health and wellness. This ever-­expanding field has become especially more important today because of the growing costs, including socioeconomic as well as those associated with human suffering. In today’s World of international business and finance, these costs are becoming even more significant because of the intertwining of world-wide economies. Indeed, a “hiccup” in one country will drastically affect others, as attested by recent economic “meltdowns” in various countries throughout the World.

              <Para TextBreak="No">Of course, occupational health and wellness is still a relatively new emerging specialty within ­science and business. However, there is now an acceptance that the overall health of both organizations and individual workers need to be taken into account in order to yield the most efficient productivity while eliminating costly factors such as disabilities, impairments, and pain that may be caused by “unhealthy” occupational conditions. Throughout this Handbook, the various chapters provided a state-of-art discussion of important issues that are now recognized to be important in this field, and where there has been some significant progress made to date. These included the nature and causes of occupational stress, major symptoms and disorders often found in the workplace (e.g., musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental health issues), the problem with absenteeism and presenteeism in the workplace, job-related burnout, self-medication and illicit drug use in the workplace/workforce, and the relatively new problem of bullying and violence in the workplace. A number of chapters were also dedicated to the evaluation of occupational causes and risks to workers’ health, such as those related to healthy vs. non-healthy workplaces, safety issues and the problem of enforcement in the workplace, and the role of work schedules in occupational health and safety. Other issues, such as the fine balance between work–family issues and work–leave policies, as well as workers’ compensation and other health-care policies for injured workers, were reviewed. These chapters provided a comprehensive evaluation of how these risks and causes of such occupational health threats are extremely important to consider. This series of chapters then segued into the now important area of prevention and intervention methods to apply in the workplace. Methods such as health and wellness promotion in the workplace, job-stress reduction programs for the workplace, primary and secondary prevention of illness in the workplace, organizational culture and workers’ mental health, and employee-assistance programs were presented to the reader. Finally because it is a hallmark of scientific inquiry, the subsequent chapters were dedicated to documenting the prevalence and effectiveness of the occupational therapeutic impact that the aforementioned chapters provided. That is to say, it is one thing to provide clinical anecdotal comments about the presumed importance of the various issues discussed, and how to impact those areas; but it is another important scientific necessity to objectively document and quantify the seriousness of the noted issues, and then to objectively document and quantify their prevalence and any methods developed to modify their impact. Therefore, the review of epidemiological methods for documenting potential occupational health and illness issues, as well as program evaluation techniques to objectively quantify the efficacy/effectiveness of prevention and intervention programs, were presented. Finally the important issue of “can we decrease illness costs in the workplace?” was addressed. With this compendium of information now on hand, a major goal is to try to synthesize the current status of this information, as well as to comment on future important directions that need to be considered. These are the goals of the ­present chapter.</Para>

              <Heading>Revisiting/Updating Past Research Areas</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In most areas of scientific inquiry, a common phenomenon that often occurs is that, after a great deal of research activity which subsequently appears to highlight or “answer” all the relevant empirical questions and integrates them in a well conceived and validated theoretical model, scientists then “move away” from that area and go on to the next research challenge. However, a decade or two later, this past research (which had been “shelved” or “archived”) may be rediscovered because the dormant area again resurfaces as important to address; or, a new technology emerges, or a theoretical heuristic surfaces, that can lead to further advances. The older model is now “dusted off” and stimulates new research to expand/modify its basic theoretical/practical tenets. As a case in point, a book published in the early 1980s by McDonald and Doyle (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002630">1981</CitationRef>) was about “… mental and physical health at work, and ways in which psychological and social aspects of working conditions can harm the health and well being of workers” (p. 1). In that book, they presented a table that summarized the various stressors at the workplace, and the consequences of such stressors on health (see Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00261">26.1</InternalRef>). As can be seen, many of these issues/factors presented at that time are now (three decades later) again receiving increased attention.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00261">

              <Para TextBreak="No">As a further example of this current phenomenon, there are two such areas that will be considered here—the effects of unemployment/nonwork on mental and physical health, and the effects of environmental/occupational crowding on health and wellness.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00263">
                <Heading>Unemployment/Nonwork</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The interest in this area has waxed and waned in unison with changes in unemployment rates. Jahoda and colleagues have been constant investigators in this area, from their earlier work on unemployment in Europe during the 1930s (Jahoda, Lazarsfeld, &amp; Zeisel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002619">1933</CitationRef>), and then throughout the rest of the century (Jahoda, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002617">1982</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002618">1988</CitationRef>). This later research focused primarily on unemployment and economic recession factors that affected the psychosocial well-being of the unemployed. At the same time, Kasl and Cobb initiated their own research documenting changes in health status associated with job loss (e.g., Kasl &amp; Cobb, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002621">1970</CitationRef>; Kasl, Gore, &amp; Cobb, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002622">1975</CitationRef>), as had Feather and O’Brien (Feather, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00268">1990</CitationRef>; O’Brien &amp; Feather, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002631">1990</CitationRef>). Most recently (2008–2012), with the Worldwide recession producing high rates of unemployment, there has been a dramatic increase in mental health problems (especially depression). For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the rate of depression in the USA in 2002 was 6.6%; it increased to 9% in 2010 (Seale, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002634">2011</CitationRef>). Moreover, the CDC has shown that suicide rates are also closely related to rises and falls in the economy. Suicide rates increased the most during the Great Depression from 1929 to 1933 (to an all-time increase of 22.1%), and has similarly gone up whenever the economy has fallen into a revision. This is also true worldwide, such as the 25% increase in the suicide rate in 2010 over the previous year, concomitant with the great unemployment rate in Greece (Kentikelenis et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002623">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Taking a slightly different approach to evaluating the detrimental effects of unemployment, Main, Phillips and Watson (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002627">2005</CitationRef>) reviewed research that addressed the detrimental effects of unemployment due to musculoskeletal disorders such as low back pain. They highlighted the negative impact of such disorders on quality of life and the development of additional health problems of injured workers. These workers were also more likely to suffer from mental health problems, increased consultation rates for other physical complaints, and even lower life expectancy rates. Such data reveal the large public health concerns associated with unemployment due to the inability of returning individuals back to work because of musculoskeletal and other work-related injuries. Later in this chapter, the increases in vocational rehabilitation efforts to return workers back to the workplace as soon as ­possible will be discussed.</Para>

              <Section2 ID="Sec00264">
                <Heading>Environmental Psychology and Crowding Research</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Environmental psychology is an area of study that evaluates the environment as a determinant or influence on human behavior and mood. Bell, Greene, Fisher, and Baum (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00262">1996</CitationRef>) had earlier reviewed how high-density living environments/conditions, such as urban areas, crowded commuter trains, dormitory areas, prison settings, etc. can lead to:
<BlockQuote>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">“… more negative affective states … and high levels of physiological arousal, as measured on a wide variety of indices. Further, there is evidence … that high density is associated with illness …” (p. 338).</Para>
                  </BlockQuote>
                </Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">McCoy (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002629">2002</CitationRef>) has more recently reviewed the significant role that work environments play in performance and creativity, as well as the health, safety, and social behaviors of workers. One common concomitant of high-density work environments is increased noise. Such “noise pollution” has been shown to have detrimental physical and mental health consequences (Bronzaft, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00264">2002</CitationRef>). In fact, Raymond, Kerr, McCullagh, and Lusk (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002632">2011</CitationRef>) have noted that noise is one of the most common occupational health hazards. They have reported that the prevalence of hearing loss among noise-exposed factory workers was 42% (based standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration). Another interesting finding of this study was that 76% of the workers reported that their hearing ability was good or excellent. This surprising finding suggests that, over time, the hearing loss was insidious in nature, with the workers accommodating to the gradually increasing levels of loss. Taken together, the findings of this investigation argue for the further development and implementation of surveillance methods and programs to address this important occupational health issue. Thus, the simple physical design of the workplace, which minimizes crowding and the noise levels that workers are exposed to, is an important factor to consider in occupational settings. Of course, as noted in the very first chapter of this Handbook, the economic pressures on companies to make money often trumps the immediate needs to make expensive workplace redesigns/renovations, unless political pressure can be brought to bear to make such changes. Of course, just as in the past, this will be a recurring problem/theme in the future that will need to be monitored and addressed throughout occupational settings.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">The above quote was taken from an article by Escorpizo, Gümunder, and Stucki (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00267">2011</CitationRef>) which was the lead article for a Special Section of the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation</Emphasis> that focused on recent advances in better understanding and measuring vocational rehabilitation (VR) processes and outcomes. Indeed, a traditional bane of all employers and employees who were faced with occupational injury was how to return the injured worker back to the workplace as quickly as possible. As we just discussed earlier, Main et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002627">2005</CitationRef>) reported the detrimental effects of unemployment due to musculoskeletal disorders. They suggested the need to get these workers rehabilitated and back to work as soon as possible in order to avoid these effects. The field of VR has been at the forefront of developing methods to best facilitate work-return after injury. An important development in this field, which was a major topic of this Special Section [entitled, “Advancing the field of vocational rehabilitation with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Healths (ICF)”] was to “… provide stakeholders and advocates in VR a unifying perspective based on the ICF, a biopsychosocial model developed by the World Health Organization … and illustrate how the VR community can benefit from using the ICF” (Escorpizo et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00267">2011</CitationRef>). This represents an enlightened and important starting point for developing a common vernacular and measurement language that can be used when addressing work disability issues, and that can be utilized by multiple stakeholders (i.e., employers, employees, the social security and insurance system, health policy authorities, etc.), across different occupations, and across different countries.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Indeed, the above effort should be applauded because it provides an “anchor-based language” to address the often complex and non-isomorphic relationships among the various areas discussed throughout the present Handbook, such as different type of jobs, various work environments, occupational health issues, and specific Health-related conditions. This common language can now be used when communicating across the various disciplines and sciences involved in the complex field of occupational health and wellness.</Para>

              <Heading>Organizational Health: Integrating Physical Design Factors and Workers’ Needs</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Industrial research scientists such as Luczak (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002626">1992</CitationRef>) have argued for the importance of a good work design environment which should be “anthropocentric” in nature (i.e., placing the individual worker at the center of the overall work design environment). This is in striking contrast to the traditional “technocentric” approach in which the work technology and economic considerations were at the center of the design process; the workers were expected to accommodate to the work environment characteristics. Of course, these do not have to be mutually exclusive approaches. For example, good ergonomic and work safety designs do not only benefit efficient production and cost-savings from management’s perspective, but also protect workers from needless accidents and injuries. However, additional empirical studies are still needed to clearly delineate how to integrate these two apparently disparate approaches in a cost-effective and satisfactory manner for both the organization and its workers.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Of course, as Baum, Gatchel, and Krantz (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00261">1997</CitationRef>) have reviewed, two important variables have been shown to significantly affect occupational stress in the work environment: job demands (i.e., job ­conditions that tax or interfere with the workers’ performance abilities such as workload and work responsibilities); and level of job autonomy or control (i.e., the ability of the worker to control the speed, nature, and conditions of work). Low levels of control over one’s job and excessive workloads seem to be a particularly important combination in heightening job-related stress. Much of this work was initially conducted by Mary Ann Frankenhauser (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00269">1979</CitationRef>) in Sweden. Karasek and Theorell (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002620">1990</CitationRef>) subsequently proposed that conditions of high demand and low control created <Emphasis Type="Italic">high strain</Emphasis> situations. Their “job-demand/control” hypothesis has been tested in several populations by applying a job characteristics scoring system based on responses to several national surveys of workers (a more thorough review of this work has been presented in earlier chapters by Dewe, O’Driscoll and Cooper, as well as Theorell in this Handbook). These job characteristics scores can then distinguish between occupations along the dimensions comprising job strain, and it has shown the ability to predict cardiovascular disease and mortality in studies of male Swedish workers and studies of men and women in the USA. Results such as these clearly indicate that work environments that are constructed to decrease “job strain” can have a significant impact on worker health and well-being. Thus, this “anthropocentric” factor would be an apparent and important one to consider in developing a good work design environment.</Para>

              <Heading>Occupational Injury Administrative and Legal Issues</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">We would be remiss if we did not introduce the reader to administrative issues that often emerge after an occupational injury or illness. Melhorn and colleagues have provided additional information on these important issues in their earlier chapter of this Handbook. Such information is quite important because many health care and human resources professionals are not well versed in these issues. As a starting point, it should be pointed out that it is now recognized that the most comprehensive and heuristic approach to the evaluation/management of medical conditions, especially those involving pain, is the biopsychosocial perspective (Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002612">2005</CitationRef>; Gatchel, Robinson, Pulliam, &amp; Maddrey, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002616">2003</CitationRef>; Turk &amp; Monarch, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002638">2002</CitationRef>). This <Emphasis Type="Italic">biopsychosocial model</Emphasis> focuses on the complex interaction among biological, psychosocial, and medicolegal variables that patients encounter when dealing with persisting and, distressing medical conditions, such as chronic pain. Such an interaction may perpetuate, and even worsen, the clinical presentation. It also accounts for the likelihood that patients’ lives are adversely affected in a variety of ways by their medical condition, thus requiring a more comprehensive assessment and treatment approach designed to address all aspects of required care, both biological and psychosocial. This approach is in striking contrast to the outdated, overly simplistic biomedical reductionist approach, which erroneously assumed that most medical illnesses could be broken down into distinct, independent physical and psychosocial components. As a case in point against this outdated approach, one study highlighted how individuals differed significantly in the frequency they report physical symptoms, and their tendency to visit physicians when experiencing identical symptoms, as well as in their responses to the same treatment (Gatchel, Kishino, &amp; Strezak, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002615">2006</CitationRef>). Often, the nature of patients’ responses to treatment has little to do with their objective physical conditions.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Another important aspect of the biopsychosocial model that deserves independent mention is in the area of <Emphasis Type="Italic">compensation injuries</Emphasis> (e.g., workers’ compensation, short/long-term disability, and personal injury litigation). It has long been known that objective, societal outcomes, such as return-to-work, future healthcare utilization, and recurrent injury rates, are considerably lower than in the general population for similar injuries, independent of the severity of injury or treatment (e.g., Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002612">2005</CitationRef>). For example, a large meta-analysis demonstrated that return-to-work rates for spinal fusion surgery to be as low as 16% in workers’ compensation populations (Turner et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002639">1992</CitationRef>). It has become clear that financial secondary gain is closely related to patient behaviors when compensation is being provided for illness. Secondary gain can be briefly defined as an individual’s attempt to avoid certain activities (such as work), obtain monetary payment (through legal settlements), or to avoid certain activities in order to receive other support (e.g., sympathy or attention) from his or her environment that otherwise would not be forthcoming (Dersh, Polatin, Leeman, &amp; Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00266">2004</CitationRef>). Compensated illness is a frequent finding in almost all industrialized countries and is a significant financial strain on employers and the healthcare system.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">As recently reiterated by Gatchel, Kishino, and Minotti (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002614">2010</CitationRef>), in addition to the aforementioned fact that there are often complex interactions among the three biopsychosocial referents of illnesses such as pain, what makes this assessment area even more complicated is that there may also be complex interactions among the construct of <Emphasis Type="Italic">illness/pain</Emphasis> and the two related constructs of <Emphasis Type="Italic">disability</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">impairment</Emphasis>. These three constructs frequently do not display high concordance with one another, thus creating a second layer of complexity. Indeed, as previously highlighted by Gatchel (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002612">2005</CitationRef>) and Gatchel and Kishino (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002613">in press</CitationRef>), it is extremely important to be aware of the important administrative distinctions among the constructs of <Emphasis Type="Italic">pain</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">disability</Emphasis>, and <Emphasis Type="Italic">impairment</Emphasis>. This is again due to the fact that there is often discordance, or a low degree of correlation, among levels of chronic pain, impairment, and disability. For example, in an early influential report by Waddell (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002640">1987</CitationRef>), the problem of discordance in the evaluation of chronic low back pain was noted (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00261">26.1</InternalRef>). Although correlations were found among these three constructs, there was not perfect overlap among these phenomena. Although they are all logically and clinically related to one another, there is usually not a 1:1:1 relation among them. Waddell (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002640">1987</CitationRef>) found correlations among them to be in the range of only about 0.6. Also, what makes these imperfect correlations even more complex is the wide range of differences in such concordance from one individual to the next (Turk &amp; Melzack, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002637">2001</CitationRef>). Healthcare professionals, therefore, need to be cognizant of the varying relationships among these constructs during the evaluation of patients. For example, one patient may display very little medical impairment that can be objectively evaluated, although he/she may verbally report a great many symptoms of illness. Ratings of disability may perhaps fall somewhere in between the two in terms of severity. In stark contrast, another patient with a seemingly comparable injury may report very few symptoms (such as pain), but may display a great deal of impairment and disability. Obviously, clinicians need to be aware of the operational definitions of these above three constructs or phenomena because they are fundamentally different. Also, it is important to be aware of what construct you are being asked to assess in specific diagnostic situations, with the expectation that there may also be complex interactions among them that may differ from one patient to the next, as well as from one assessment time period to the next. These three constructs have been further discussed in the medical impairment and disability evaluation literature (e.g., Dembe, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00265">2000</CitationRef>; Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002610">1996</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002612">2005</CitationRef>). We will again briefly review them next.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00261">

                <Heading>Pain</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">We just discussed the construct of pain, which is a common symptom of occupational injuries and illness in general. Chronic pain (i.e., pain lasting for greater than three months) is a biopsychosocial concept based primarily on an experiential or subjective evaluation (Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002611">2004</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002612">2005</CitationRef>). The construct of pain is frequently used to infer the presence of some biopsychosocial mechanisms that prompts patients’ complaints and inhibition of normal functioning and behavior. It is often difficult to quantify chronic pain in a totally objective and reliable manner. This is also frequently true for other illnesses, such as multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, whiplash injuries, PTSD, etc. Usually, simple patient self-report measures are used, which can often be too subjective and unreliable (Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002612">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00269">
                <Heading>Impairment</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Impairment has traditionally been a medical term which is used to refer to an alteration of an individual’s usual health status (i.e., some anatomical or pathophysiological abnormality) that is evaluated by medical methods. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">American Medical Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (Sixth Edition)</Emphasis> defines impairment as “a significant deviation, loss, or loss of use of any body structure or body function in an individual with a health condition, disorder, or disease” (Rondinelli et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002633">2008</CitationRef>). The evaluation of impairment via an independent medical evaluation is conducted to determine some inferred pathophysiology or anatomical dysfunction that is assumed to have a negative impact on a patient’s current health status or behavior (such as a significant loss, or loss of use, of a body structure or function). Unfortunately, however, such impairment evaluation relies upon methods that are often not totally reliable (physical examination findings tend to have a low inter-examiner reliability) and that are often subject to examiner bias, as well as patient effort. Nevertheless, its assessment is supposed to be standardized and should remain the same for any individual, regardless of differences in occupation. Thus, an injured worker who sustains a traumatic amputation of the dominant third finger will have the same impairment rating under a workers’ compensation system claim, regardless of whether the worker was a truck driver who is still able to driver trucks or a data entry person who now has to change jobs. It is therefore important to inform patients that, if their case falls under an impairment-based system, then their monetary award will have little to do with their functional abilities and pain. Such monetary award differences may occur when determining disability. Finally, it should also be pointed out that progress towards recovery will often have no impact on the impairment evaluation or, conversely, a lack of recovery may not increase the impairment evaluation. This will be the case when a designated physician documents that Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI) has been reached by the patient. MMI is typically defined “… in part as the earliest date after which, based on reasonable medical probability, further material recovery from or lasting improvement to an injury can no longer be reasonably anticipated” [Texas Department of Insurance—Division of Worker’s Compensation, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002636">2008</CitationRef>, 401.011 (30) (A)]. The “reasonable medical probability” part of this definition suggests that an MMI may often be quite subjective and may differ from one designated physician to the next. With this in mind, a healthcare professional should not prematurely insist on the documentation that MMI has been reached if there is any chance that progress in recovery is no longer a possibility (which may be manifested by improvement in physical findings such as range-of-motion and lifting capacity). This is because that once MMI has been documented as having been reached, then there is no longer the possibility of changing the patient’s impairment rating.</Para>

              <Section2 ID="Sec002610">
                <Heading>Disability</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Disability is more of an administrative term that refers to a diminished capacity or inability to perform certain activities of everyday living or occupational demands (or to meet statutory or regulatory requirements of a job) as a result of loss of function, due to impairment. Again, though, disability evaluations are not totally reliable and may also be subject to various examiner and patient response biases. Nevertheless, disability will vary depending on the “gap” between what the person can do and what the person needs or wants to do. Thus, under a system that uses a disability-based formula, such as Social Security Disability Insurance or personal injury litigation, the loss of the dominant third finger would have a much greater impact on the monetary award for the data entry person than the truck driver because the award would take into account future earning capacity. Under such systems, the clinician may be asked to render an opinion about work capacity, pain, and suffering, and other issues outside the immediate realm of medical opinion or the impairment rating. It should also be noted that the aforementioned “disability-based formula” will differ from one venue to the next. For example, each State has its own workers’ compensation system, with different guidelines. As a healthcare professional, it is up to you to be well versed in such differences in medicolegal jurisdictions. These different jurisdictions, in turn, may have different levels of “secondary gain” issues associated with them.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Throughout this present Handbook, we have reviewed various health disorders, interventions and possible organizational programs to address health and wellness issues. At this point in time, the great deal of research and theory developed in this field has not yet been fully integrated in order to address important issues such as matching jobs and work design, related interventions to improve health issues that may arise, and how organizational structure can help employee health. In terms of the latter issue, it will be important to ensure that there is a healthy feedback system within the entire organization so that the needs of the “company” and those of the “workers” are constantly being appropriately monitored and addressed in an integrated manner. That is to say, the “left hand” needs to know what the “right hand” is doing at all times in order to avoid sudden increases in grievances and morale problems, health issues, productivity, economic problems, etc. This will be no easy task, and a great deal of coordinated effort is needed to accomplish the ultimate “healthy organizational hierarchical system.” As an example of such a system, Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00262">26.2</InternalRef> presents the various components that need to be integrated and monitored into a meaningful whole in order to maximize worker productivity, safety, and health.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00262">

Myers, originated the application of systematic research to workplace issues … Most of what we do in I-O psychology draws on or at least is informed by some type of evidence …” (p. 3). However, in a special issue of the journal, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Industrial and Organizational Psychology</Emphasis> (2011, Volume 4, Issue 1), a plea for more evidence-based practice approaches is made. Indeed, this is one field that is greatly needed to help address many of the issues that we have addressed in this Handbook. However, to date, integration of new developments of work practice models with the evidence-based documentation of their validity/reliability has not been forthcoming. For the future advancement of this field, and the vital role it can play in occupational health and illness issues, further integration and growth is urgently needed.</Para>

              <Heading>Summary and Conclusions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">As we have noted, occupational health and wellness is still a new emerging specialty within science and business. Nevertheless, there is now an acceptance of the fact that the overall health of both organizations and individual workers needs to be taken into account in order to yield the most efficient productivity while, simultaneously, eliminating costly factors such as disabilities, impairments, and pain that may be caused by “unhealthy” occupational conditions. Throughout this present Handbook, the various chapters provided a state-of-art discussion of important issues that are now recognized to be important in this field, and where there has been some significant progress made to date. A major goal of the current chapter was to attempt to synthesize the current status of this information presented, as well as to comment on future important directions that need to be considered. We initially addressed two areas that, although investigated widely two decades ago, are now being “rediscovered” as important in the field of occupational health and wellness: the effects of unemployment/nonwork on mental and physical health and the effects of environmental–occupational crowding on health and illness. It was revealed that there is a large public health concern associated with unemployment due to the inability of returning individuals back to work because of musculoskeletal and other work-related injuries. We also addressed the current increase in vocational rehabilitation efforts to return workers back to the workplace as soon as possible. We then introduced the reader to the important area of environmental psychology, with specific emphasis on how crowding research is of particular relevance to the field. Indeed, researchers are now reviewing the significant role that work environments play in performance and creativity, as well as the health, safety, and social behaviors of workers. One common concomitant of high-density work environments is increased “noise pollution,” which has been shown to have detrimental physical and mental health consequences. Thus, the physical design of a workplace, which minimizes crowding and noise levels that workers are exposed to, is an important factor to consider in occupational settings.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Industrial research scientists have long argued for the importance of a good work design environment which should be “anthropocentric” in nature. This is in striking contrast to the traditional “technocentric” approach which emphasized that workers were expected to accommodate to the work environment characteristics. However, we pointed out that these two approaches do not have to be mutually exclusive. Good ergonomic and work safety designs do not only benefit efficient production and cost-savings from managements’ perspective, but also protect workers from needless accidents and injuries. For example, two important variables that have been shown to significantly affect occupational stress in the work environment are job demands and level of job autonomy or control. Much of this research was initiated in Sweden by Frankenhauser and then expanded by Karasek and colleagues. These investigators proposed a “job-demand/control” hypothesis that created <Emphasis Type="Italic">high strain</Emphasis> job situations. <Emphasis Type="Italic">High strain</Emphasis> jobs were found to be associated with increased health problems in workers.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">We also introduced the reader to administrative issues that often emerge after an occupational injury or illness. The biopsychosocial model was emphasized as important in better understanding the complex interactions among biological, psychological, and medicolegal variables that patients’ encounter when dealing with persisting, distressing medical conditions. This biopsychosocial model is important to keep in mind when dealing with important occupational health areas such as compensation injuries. Constructs such as pain, disability, and impairment, and the fact that there is often a discordance or a low degree of correlation among the three, was also discussed. It is extremely important for professionals in the field of occupational health and wellness to become well-versed in the various administrative and legal issues associated with injuries and health issues. We then went on to discuss how to enhance organization and employee health in general. A model was proposed that took into account regular components that need to be integrated and monitored into a meaningful whole in order to maximize worker productivity, safety, and health. Finally, as was emphasized, with the emergent advances and recognized importance of the field of occupational health and wellness, there has been a concomitant growth of organizations and agencies specializing in various areas in this large field. We provided a brief review of many of these to serve as a reference guide to readers. A special call was also made for the field of Industrial and Organizational Psychology to increase its contributions of evidence-based approaches to work practice issues.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Each chapter in this Handbook concluded with a section with suggestions for future directions needed to further advance the key concepts/issues discussed. To those, some additional ones should be noted. These are delineated below.

                    <Para TextBreak="No">The actual understanding/definition of “work” as we now know it will be continuing to change in the future. Indeed, the earlier assembly line type of jobs are already being replaced by more automatic/robotic streamlined production. Where will a worker interface with this type of production? Also, new needs (such as drone aircraft controllers) may continue to expand, as will “virtual reality” methods of solving business issues and problems.</Para>

                  <ItemContent>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">Relatedly, what will happen to the traditional blue collar, unionized workers who manned the assembly lines? Can these “blue collar” workers be transitioned to more “white collar” jobs? This will undoubtedly create some political fall-out in terms of the “union vote” and politicians up for reelection. Indeed, with the recent trends in the “downsizing” by many companies, and their greater reliance on “outsourcing” to part-time or contingent workers, new issues are arising concerning how these workers will interface with traditional workers. Some of these issues were discussed in the chapter by Cole.</Para>

                  <ItemContent>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">Related to the above is the fact that we are already seeing a great outsourcing of jobs to countries with a workforce that is content with a minimum wage. How can this be better managed so that it can be a “win–win” situation for both the countries involved, as well as their workers? Can occupational health issues be carefully considered and managed by both the developed and under-developed countries involved?</Para>

                    <Para TextBreak="No">Superimposed on all of the above issues/questions is the great concern of decreasing natural resources to keep up with the industrial growth that is occurring across the globe. What type of international controls can be created to monitor this? This will create an entirely new international administration to help in this monitoring and coordination. No longer will negotiations between workers and employers be limited to individual countries, but it will have to expand across countries.</Para>

                    <Para TextBreak="No">We are beginning to see a growth in the number of intervention strategies to increase occupational health and wellness. However, the traditional methods of documenting their efficacy/effectiveness will need to “change with the times.” It is now not enough to simply empirically demonstrate that one approach is better than another. With the staggering and growing healthcare costs in the USA, the federal government is now moving towards finding the best ways to develop interventions that are both therapeutically efficacious and <Emphasis Type="Italic">cost-effective</Emphasis> (Lauer &amp; Collins, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002625">2010</CitationRef>). This has stimulated the need for more comparative effectiveness research (CER; Manchikanti, Falco, Boswell, &amp; Hirsch, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002628">2010</CitationRef>; Sox, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002635">2010</CitationRef>). One vital feature of CER is the use of cost-effectiveness analyses in order to help objectively document the most <Emphasis Type="Italic">cost-effective</Emphasis> intervention method. This has been sorely lacking in past intervention research in the field, and will need to be in the forefront of future efforts in the development/documentation of prevention and intervention methods in the workplace.</Para>

                  <ItemContent>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">There has been a definite increase in the number of workplace wellness programs being offered by employers, due to the research in this area demonstrating potential cost-savings and worker productivity. In their chapter, Shaw and colleagues highlighted the fact that the number of employers offering workplace wellness programs with financial incentives to employees in the USA has been steadily rising despite the recent recession-economic environment. That is the good news. However, some have voiced the concern that such wellness programs could actually be used as a means to discriminate against potentially sicker employees who cannot meet a given incentive (e.g., lose  ×  number of pounds for a merit-pay increase or a decrease in your insurance deductible). As referenced by Kliff (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002624">2012</CitationRef>) from a <Emphasis Type="Italic">Business Week</Emphasis> article:</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">… Georgetown authors cite one wellness program that wields a stick. It suggests employers raise deductibles from, say, $500 to $2,500. Workers can then “earn credits” worth $500 each to lower the deductible if they meet certain targets for four factors: body-mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, and tobacco use. A nonsmoking, normal-weight employee with healthy cholesterol and blood pressure winds up back at the $500 deductible. “If you’re on the wrong end of any of those four tests, your costs have gone up …” The Georgetown authors say they want to make sure wellness incentives actually make people healthier and don’t just shift costs onto sick workers. “There’s really strong research showing that the higher the deductible, the greater the barrier to accessing care,” … “Someone may not be getting basic primary care or necessary care to treat a chronic condition.”</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Thus, one must always be concerned that a well-intentioned program can be “hijacked” for inappropriate purposes.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">With the above areas in mind, it will be important to develop more comprehensive theoretical, economic, and prevention/intervention frameworks that take into account workers, worksites, ­employers, local and national administrations, as well as international cooperation, in order to address occupational health and wellness issues.</Para>
