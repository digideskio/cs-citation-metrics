          <Para TextBreak="No">Sociology of bioethics is still an emerging area in sociological studies. The essence of this chapter is to further promote the understanding of bioethics and stress the relevance of sociology to the bioethical agenda. The critical areas of bioethics are explored to provide (sociological) understanding of the core issues in bioethics and how sociology could contribute to the social dimensions of the bioethical agenda. Sociology of bioethics deals with the application of sociological insights, perspectives, and methods to the understanding of the moral dimensions of the life sciences and health care. The chapter proceeds with the history and notions of bioethics with reference to the works of Fritz Jahr (1895–1953) and Van Rensselaer Potter (1911–2001), which are landmarks in the development of the discipline. The chapter then presents the varieties of bioethics including theoretical bioethics, clinical bioethics/health care ethics, research ethics, biotech bioethics, public health bioethics, policy and regulatory bioethics, and cultural bioethics. For further understanding, the discussion continues with some core areas of moral perplexities in health care, principlism in bioethics (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice), and casuistry as a method of ethical case deliberation.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Bioethics is a distinctive field of study and practice, although in practice it involves transdisciplinary approach. It has links with law, public policy, historical studies, the popular media; the disciplines of philosophy, religion<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Religion</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, literature, medicine, biology, ecology; and population studies and social sciences<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Social sciences</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> (Callahan <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2004</CitationRef>, p. 279)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Callahan, D.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Health social sciences (in particular) are relevant in the consideration of the bioethical agenda. The essence of this chapter is to promote the understanding of bioethics and stress the relevance of sociology to the bioethical agenda. The idea is not to provide a comprehensive examination of bioethics as a field or an in-depth analysis of topics in bioethics but to explore some of the critical areas of bioethics in order to provide (sociological) understanding of the core issues (as background for students) in the field. This should also expose how sociology could contribute to the social dimensions of the bioethical agenda.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Bioethics has been defined in various ways. One definition is that it is a multidisciplinary endeavour focusing on the study and regulation of the moral, legal, social, and philosophical perplexities in health care and the development and application of science and technology in human life. The critical focus of bioethics is “conflict of interest” that often arises from biomedical sciences in relation to human life or survival. In other words, “bioethics is a field that ranges from the anguished private and individual dilemmas faced by physicians or other healthcare workers at the bedside of a patient, to the terrible public and societal choices faced by citizens and legislators as they try to devise equitable health or environmental policies” (Callahan <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2004</CitationRef>, p. 280)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Callahan, D.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Moral questions often come with the application and development of sciences. Such dilemmas could be the question of what is right or appropriate in the context of care, allocation of resources, formulation of policies, research development, and application of technologies<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Technologies</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Bioethics often starts with a critical assessment of the prevailing circumstances and consideration of the limits of scientific practices in relation to human values.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Providing a more encompassing definition, Reich (<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">1995</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Reich, W.T.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> defined bioethics as the systematic study of the moral dimensions—including moral vision, decisions, conducts, and policies—of the life sciences and health care, employing a variety of ethical methodologies in an interdisciplinary setting. One major addition to Reich’s definition is the issue of <Emphasis Type="Italic">vision</Emphasis>. Bioethics does not only relate to the rightness or appropriateness of the present moral conduct but also with the historical and future evolutionary and sociocultural implications. Invariably, the implications of biomedical conduct for the future generations are part of the essential focus of bioethics.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It is important to note that bioethical practice is usually prescriptive through assertion of values and moral judgments (Turner <CitationRef CitationID="CR42">2009</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Turner, L.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. In order to make moral judgments, bioethicists need to understand the ethical issues emanating from a particular moral dilemma. In addition, bioethicists require some understanding of the institutional structures, social arrangements, and normative patterns in the social worlds within which ethical issues emerge (Turner <CitationRef CitationID="CR42">2009</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Turner, L.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. These sociocultural, normative, and institutional issues are mostly within the confines of sociological studies. As noted earlier (see Sect. <ExternalRef>
              <RefSource>1.1</RefSource>
              <RefTarget Address="10.1007/978-3-319-03986-2_1#Sec1" TargetType="DOI"/>
            </ExternalRef>
), sociology deals with understanding social relations and institutions, stressing on the social norms, order, and facts. The social facts<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Social facts</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> or realities, norms, and culture constitute the basis of human morality<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Morality</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Therefore, sociological insight and input are crucial in bioethics if the ethical conundrums presented by science (in general) and medicine (in particular) are to be successfully resolved in practice.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Sociology of bioethics<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Sociology of bioethics</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> deals with the application of sociological insights, perspectives, and methods to the understanding of the moral dimensions of the life sciences and health care. Sociologists can provide input in ethical deliberations because of their in-depth understanding of the patterns of social relations and cultural beliefs. The only caution is that while sociology (like other social sciences) often tends to provide universal ideas, the views of moral relativism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Relativism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> and particularism are central, especially in clinical bioethics<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Clinical bioethics</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. In bioethical practice, what is universally appropriate may defy an individual’s choice, which must be respected. Despite the universal contents, in practical terms morality varies from one individual to another. The use of moral relativism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Relativism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is applicable in the cultural context <Emphasis Type="Italic">and</Emphasis> at the individual level in bioethical practice. For instance, while cosmetic surgery<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Cosmetic surgery</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> may be good for person A, it might not be for both person B and the community as a whole because of the differential preference and costs involved. It explains the difficulty in arriving at a collective sentiment regarding access to a particular form of care.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In addition, medical sociology holds a lot of crosscutting interests with bioethics. The issues regarding organisation of health care (see Sect. <ExternalRef>
              <RefSource>10.3.4</RefSource>
              <RefTarget Address="10.1007/978-3-319-03986-2_10#Sec23" TargetType="DOI"/>

); social determinants of health (see Chap. <ExternalRef>
              <RefSource>4</RefSource>

            </ExternalRef>); allocation of health resources, health policies, and politics; cultural context of scientific conducts; and health practices among others are approached by the fields from different perspectives. The major difference lies in the prescriptiveness of bioethics by focusing on how to ensure justice<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Justice</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> among various groups and thereby making some form of ethical recommendations. In relation to ethical discourse, medical sociology focuses more on the sociocultural context responsible for (re)production of population health and social implications of policies and related issues. Having made some clarifications about bioethics and the sociology of bioethics<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Sociology of bioethics</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, it is important to examine the history and changing notions of bioethics.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">This surge in new medical possibilities and applications generated moral contestations, which led to new voices and movement regarding the <Emphasis Type="Italic">limits of science</Emphasis>.

            </IndexTerm> (applied in social relations, politics, or economics) have been a part of the concerns of the fathers of philosophy (e.g., Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, Kant, Epicurus, and Aquinas). The Hippocratic Oath<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Hippocratic Oath</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is all about medical ethics, regulating the conducts of medical professionals to conform to the value of care. Despite this historical antecedence, the development of bioethics as a discipline is a recent development.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Bioethics flourished from the 1970s, especially with the works of Van Rensselaer Potter (1911–2001)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Potter, V.R.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, which were landmarks in the development of the discipline. But before Potter, recent developments revealed that Fritz Jahr (1895–1953), a German teacher and theologian, is credited as the first to use the term “bioethics” in his paper “Bio-ethics: A Panorama of Ethical Relations of Man Toward the Animal and the Plant” in 1927. It was further observed that during some 20 years of his publishing activity (1927–1947), Jahr authored 18 papers in which ethical discourse was frequently featured (Muzur and Rinčić <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Muzur, A.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>
            <IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Rinčić, I.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Jahr’s initial conception of bioethics was based on the acceptance of moral obligations to all living beings (including plants and lower animals, especially in relations to humans). Jahr (<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">1927</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Jahr, F.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> submitted that every living being should be respected as such and cannot be destroyed arbitrarily and worthlessly, as they all (plants and animals as well as people) have rights. This was a pioneer promotion of the right to life of animals and plants in relation to humans, particularly with the advocacy of animal rights. In his 1927 paper, Jahr made a striking remark that has formed a fundamental thrust in bioethics in the 21st century: that every living being should be respected essentially as an end-in-itself and should be treated as such (the influence of Kantianism is evident in the statement)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Kantianism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. As it will later be observed, <Emphasis Type="Italic">respect</Emphasis> for persons and non-tolerance of the instrumental use of persons<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Persons</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> are now core ideas in bioethics (see Sect. <ExternalRef>

              <RefTarget Address="10.1007/978-3-319-03986-2_11#Sec13" TargetType="DOI"/>

            </IndexTerm>.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The most widely read history of bioethics, however, began in the 1970s with the works of Potter, who is also credited to have (re)-coined the term “bioethics” in 1970. This development presents a bi-location of the origin of the concept of bioethics. Perhaps because his papers were published in English, they were more widely read than Jahr’s. Potter re-coined <Emphasis Type="Italic">bioethics</Emphasis> to describe the need to bridge science and human values by combining the science of biology (<Emphasis Type="Italic">bio</Emphasis>) and the study of human value systems (<Emphasis Type="Italic">ethics</Emphasis>) (Potter <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">1970</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">1971</CitationRef>, p. vii)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Potter, V.R.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, and he stressed that he was proposing a new discipline. In 1971 Potter published the first major book in the new discipline—<Emphasis Type="Italic">Bioethics: Bridge to the Future.</Emphasis> The conception of bioethics by Potter (<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">1971</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Potter, V.R.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> provided elaborate notions of bioethics as a bridge between present and future, science and values, nature and nurture/culture, and man and nature. By relating bioethics to a bridge between the present and the future, Potter implies that there is need to regulate the emergence of any scientific knowledge that is potentially detrimental to the future survival of mankind (Ten Have <CitationRef CitationID="CR41">2012</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Ten Have, H.A.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. This will require development of utopia frameworks—what “ought to be or ideal patterns” which will enable bioethics to provide directions towards the attainment of future goals of mankind. Potter averred that science should proceed with wisdom combined with the values of humility and respect (Potter <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">1971</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Potter, V.R.</Primary>

A combination of biological and cultural adaptability is inevitable for human survival; bioethics should also provide the wisdom to always link the two.

              </IndexTerm>. Hence there are series of invocation of moral theories in bioethics. Many bioethicists specialise in theoretical analysis and application of theories to ethical discourse. This aspect is one of the core areas that has developed with close links to philosophy. The discussion of moral ethics<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Moral ethics</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> requires adequate philosophising to create a systemised body of theoretical or epistemological stance upon which subsequent specialists can rely. Therefore, there are a number of theoretical underpinnings in bioethics. It is important to note that modern bioethics was born in the West and the earlier prominent theoretical perspective reflects the traditions of Western moral philosophy, political, and social theories (Chattopadhyay and De Vries <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2008</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            <Para TextBreak="No">The development of ethical theories is thus necessitated to provide a systematised philosophical basis of medical science, ethics of health care, and research involving human subjects. The objective of an ethical theory is to provide an adequate normative framework for processing and resolving moral problems (Beauchamp <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2003</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Beauchamp, T.M.</Primary>

                <Primary>Middle-range theories</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>, there is also a growing application of religious doctrines in ethical deliberations. This is why theologians and philosophers are among the core specialists in theoretical bioethics. The theories often provide various arguments that are sometimes vague in guiding moral judgments in practical incidents. However, the three major derivatives from some of the theories are “rights, duties and norms.” The rights of an individual in any situation, the professional duties of the scientists, and the normative regulations are the core guiding priorities of most of the theoretical underpinnings. African philosophy also provides streams of moralities that conform to the norms and values of the African people. This helps to provide a relative basis in the consideration of ethics in the African context<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Unlike theoretical bioethics<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                <Primary>Clinical bioethics</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> focuses on the individual case to determine an appropriate clinical/care decision. There is often tension between the professional construction of facts and that of the patients, as well as the desires of the parties. Such cases might require hard decisions (e.g., withdrawal of treatment and abortion) that must be guided by professional ethics, normative values, and personal choices of the patients. The normative framework also includes the legal codes, which mediate medical practice. The interplay of these guiding principles serves to build a method of resolving ethical apprehensions in clinical cases.</Para>

              </IndexTerm> do not only stop at the level of the hospital but also within the norms of society. For instance, a request for an abortion must be considered within the legal rules of the society—whether the law prescribes or proscribes it, whether professional ethics prescribe abortion as care or harm to the embryo, whether the patient understands the implications of the procedure or has a <Emphasis Type="Italic">tenable</Emphasis> reason for requesting abortion. In this case, there are many issues that interplay to arrive at an ethical decision. The same applies to the request for euthanasia<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> by a patient (see Sect. <ExternalRef>

              </IndexTerm>, and patterns of interaction and control of medical malpractice are the core of clinical ethics. The exchange of information in a medical setting could involve sensitive disclosures. For instance, how will the physician disclose to a patient with a terminal disease that death is imminent and medicine is helpless, and that the condition is irreversible? Does the physician have a right to inform a partner of a person living with HIV of the risk of HIV without the permission of the patient? Sometimes, respecting patient’s choices could be problematic because of overindulgence or uneasy requests. In other words, are there limits to a patient’s involvement in care? How can the physician handle incompetent patients (with a mental problem or in a vegetative state) without compromising their own moral values? Can the values of parents be applied to their underage children, especially when those values are against biomedical norms? Is it ethical to withhold or withdraw treatment from a newborn with spina bifida or because of perceived non-clinical benefits or established poor prognosis? The vital issue involves how to handle a particular patient without compromising personal, social, legal, and medical rules/norms<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The fundamental crux is how to ensure moral science as being against “jungle” science where all practices prevail irrespective of their implications. Sometimes scientists want to generate empirical facts and solutions without considering the limits, long-term implications, and the rights of the (human) participants.

                <Primary>Personhood</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. The human agents deserve and expect respect in all medical interventions. There are three major aspects of respect in medical encounters, which include the person, body, and values. While it can be argued that the body and values are integral parts of the person, they are mentioned separately to signify that they represent distinct issues. The most fundamental issue is that a human person should not be used as a means to an end. The human person has the highest intrinsic value in the application of technologies and medical care (Amzat and Grandi

              </IndexTerm>. This is why there are debates on the consideration of the human person in bioethics. The central thesis is that the “human person is a subject, not an object as are the things of the world.” Janssens further elaborated that the human person should have opportunities for self-determination as a moral agent, deciding on all his or her doings in conscience and consequently in a responsible way. More so, “the human person is a subject in corporeality. Our body forms part of the totality that we are: what concerns our human body affects our person” (Janssens <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">1990</CitationRef>, p. 94, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">1999</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            <Para TextBreak="No">Medical encounters and health care (in general) present with a variety of issues that emphasise the notions of the human person. For instance, in medical encounters, it is important to note some of the core value expectations of the patients/clients; the wishes and values of human persons should be considered or prioritised during medical encounters. The human person should not be reduced to a medical condition or discriminated due to a medical condition. It also involves whether the application of biotechnology and medical practices are good for the human person and considers the implications for human safety and survival. In the use of body products such as blood in the biobank or medical information, there must be confidentiality<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> and conscientious use in a way that will protect personal/human values. The exchange of information between the physician and the client should involve truth telling, appropriate disclosures, and trust. The use of informed consent in research and medical interventions has become a legal and ethical requirement. Informed consent<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Informed consent</Primary>

Can the family members decide on such vital care on behalf of the patient? For some patients that are “competent,” it is also possible that the experience of pain might positively influence the decision.

Nevertheless, the essence of the principles is to provide a framework to direct moral decision-making in health care. The overall goal is to ensure respect for human persons, promote freedom and choices, and prevent medical malpractice.

This indicates respect for privacy, individual choices, freedom of will, and self-actualisation without coercion or undue interference from external forces/agents. The only basis of interference on the part of the physician is to provide adequate technical information that would aid personal choices.

                <Primary>Place</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> that will lead to recovery. This is a duty-based approach in care. Some of the moral rules include: protection of rights, prevention of harm, alleviating conditions that could cause harm, and providing assistance to high-risk persons or those with disabilities.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">It is often problematic to decide on the criteria that will be used in promoting the well-being of the patient since health is not only about medical well-being but also includes social and psychological well-being (see Veatch <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">2012</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

A medical decision to amputate might also affect aesthetic and economic well-being.

                <Primary>Justice</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> is often applied to an individual relative to others in the society or examined to access the general conditions of health services. It implies that fairness and equality must be prioritised in the allocation of finite resources. In terms of justice, issues such as access to health care and health insurance<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Health insurance</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> are paramount. Generally, there are three aspects of justice: fair distribution of scarce resources (distributive justice)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Distributive justice</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>, respect for people’s rights (rights based justice), and respect for morally acceptable laws (legal justice) (Gillon <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">1994</CitationRef>, p. 185)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Gillon, R.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Distributive justice refers to “fair, equitable, and appropriate distribution determined by justified norms that structure the terms of social cooperation” (Beauchamp and Childress <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2001</CitationRef>, p. 226)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>. In this sense, “justice” goes beyond equal treatment and focuses on equal prioritisation of needs as there are many different health care needs in a society. Justice<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Justice</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> also involves situations in which the rights of individuals are respected and protected within the social and legal context.</Para>

              </IndexTerm> and enact public policies in health care. For instance, providing incentives to the vulnerable populations (especially the poor) will promote access to health care and thereby reduce the mortality rate of the country. There should be a responsive minimisation and mitigation of the effects of personal attributes (e.g., class and gender) in access to health care. The doctrine of justice plays a pivotal role, especially within relational context. There are numerous criteria for justly allocating health care resources that can be morally justified but not all can be fully met simultaneously (Gillon <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">1994</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Gillon, R.</Primary>

            <Para TextBreak="No">The four principles have been widely defended as moral guidelines, especially as a North American ideology of bioethics. While the four principles have been popularised, it is also important to note that there are a number of criticisms with respect to ordering the principles and their perceived absoluteness in ethical considerations. More importantly, the European tradition promotes different bioethical principles which include autonomy<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>. The European principles were generated after a multidisciplinary research study involving many EU countries which led to the Barcelona Declaration of 1998 of the four European principles of bioethics. Briefly, <Emphasis Type="Italic">autonomy</Emphasis> is described as having a capacity for moral insight, self-rule, and self-responsibility free from coercion; <Emphasis Type="Italic">dignity</Emphasis>

          <Heading>Structures in Bioethical Deliberations</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">While there are moral codes, it is often pertinent to institute structures that will apply the codes and inform moral decisions. This is why health care/clinical ethics committees and review boards are instituted. These are regulatory agencies with the specialised function of evaluating biomedical circumstances and moral implications with the purpose of resolving cases and playing advisory roles. In cases where there are no ethics institutions, the physician still holds paternalistic power to make appropriate moral implications based on prevailing sociomedical and legal contexts. The development of ethics committees is recent in Africa and many medical institutions still lack such a committee. On the other hand, institutional review boards (IRB)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Institutional review boards (IRBs)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> are still at the early stage of recognition. The following two subsections will briefly examine casuistry as a responsibility of clinical ethics committees and the roles of IRBs in the management of research protocol.</Para>

            <Heading>Casuistry: Health Care Ethical Case Deliberation</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Following the rising incidence of moral uneasiness in medicine, there is a need to draw specific practical strategies of resolving issues to produce ethical decisions. This gives rise to the development of health care ethics committees to deliberate and make prescriptive recommendations on the appropriate course of action for the treating physician. The method used by the health care ethics committee is called casuistry<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Casuistry</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Casuistry, “a term derived from the Latin word meaning <Emphasis Type="Italic">event or occurrence</Emphasis> and in later Latin, <Emphasis Type="Italic">case</Emphasis>,” is now applied in bioethics (especially health care/clinical ethics) as the “method of analysing and resolving instances of moral perplexity by interpreting general moral rules in light of particular circumstances” (Jonsen <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2004</CitationRef>, p. 374)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Jonsen, A.R.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. The committee usually consists of a number of experts including (but not limited to) medical, legal, cultural, and theological experts who examine a particular case with the goal of making recommendations. In a previous elaborate definition, Jonsen and Toulmin (<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">1988</CitationRef>, p. 257)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                <Primary>Toulmin, S.E.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> defined <Emphasis Type="Italic">casuistry</Emphasis> as a method of case deliberation “using procedures of reasoning based on paradigms and analogies, leading to the formulation of expert opinion about the existence and stringency of particular moral obligations, framed in terms of rules and maxims that are general but not universal or invariable, since they hold good with certainty only in the typical conditions of the agent and circumstances of the case.”</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Case deliberation is important because there are no universal procedures or regulations applicable to all cases. The primary features of any case deliberations are relativism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>, particularism, and specificity. While these features are sacrosanct, the committee might be guided by a general procedure. For instance, the Nijmegen Method of ethical case deliberation is one of the most elaborate methods which takes into consideration most of the issues that might enhance appropriate action prescriptions. The issues identified in the Nijmegen Method<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> includes: the moral problem in the case, the available facts on the case (including medical, nursing, patient’s views, social, and organisational dimensions), values (including well-being and autonomy<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Autonomy</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> of the patient and responsibility of health care professionals), and decision-making (recapitulation of the moral problem, unknown details, arguments, decision, and evaluation) (Steinkamp and Gordijn <CitationRef CitationID="CR40">2003</CitationRef>, p. 240)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Due to the aforementioned features, there is a reasonable methodological plurality across health care organisations or countries and thus also on the values and factors leading to the formulation of ethical decision.
