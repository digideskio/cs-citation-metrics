              <Para TextBreak="No">This chapter discusses work-related factors that influence the health of employees and, in particular, their mental health. It draws on the work of researchers in the fields of organizational development, health and safety and mental health to delineate key areas of focus and their relevance to creating mentally healthy workplaces. The factors are presented within a framework that views mental health in the workplace as the outcome of several domains that most certainly intersect, but are presented here as distinct entities. The framework is depicted in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00121">12.1</InternalRef> and entails Job Design, Leadership, Organizational Culture and Job Future. Similar frameworks have been presented in the workplace health literature (see for example, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001211">CMHA &amp; Dalla Lana School of Public Health</CitationRef>; Wilson, Dejoy, Vandenberg, Richardson, &amp; Mcgrath, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012105">2004</CitationRef>). In most of these models, including the one presented here, job design refers to work tasks and perceptions of them, leadership focuses on the qualities and practices implemented by those who lead, organizational culture refers to social and interpersonal aspects of work and job future refers to security and career development.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00121">

              <Heading>Job Design</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Job design refers to aspects of the immediate work tasks, the conditions under which they are ­performed, and how they are perceived and experienced by individual workers. Job design consists of the rules (both explicit and implicit) that exist within all organizations and govern expectations around what employees do on a daily basis at work, when, where, and how employees complete their work, and how much discretion or choice they have within their jobs. Components of job design that have been identified as important in considering the psychosocial health of the workplace and workers within the organization include: job content and workload; choice and control; role clarity; environmental conditions; work schedules including flexible work; and reward systems (many of these issues are discussed in other chapters of this handbook). In this section we review evidence about the relationship between various components of job design and the mental health and well-being of workers.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00123">
                <Heading>Job Content and Workload</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Job content and workload are important and related concepts within workplace health literature. Job content is a broad concept that refers to the composition of the individual’s work roles, tasks, and demands. Workload refers more specifically to the amount of work or task demands assigned to a worker or group of workers in a given period of time. Both concepts have been examined in terms of their impact on the mental health and well-being of workers. The content and demands of a job should be well matched to the skills and competencies of the worker, and should provide sufficient challenge without over-taxing the worker. Work associated with excessive repetition, monotony, and the experience of boredom, or conversely, excessive demands, stress and insufficient resources have been associated with mental and physical health problems, and behaviors such as drinking and smoking (Leka &amp; Jain, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001259">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Among health-care workers in particular, job content and workload have been identified as key determinants of the quality of the workplace environment and critical issues in the health and well-being of healthcare workers. For example, Ramirez, Graham, Richards, Cull, and Gregory (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001275">1996</CitationRef>) found that among medical specialists, feeling overloaded, poorly managed, and dealing with patient suffering were associated with burnout and psychiatric morbidity. However, job satisfaction provided protection against work overload, as did feeling proficient in communication and management skills. This latter finding suggests that the broader concept of job content has an important role to play in the experience of work overload. Cole et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001213">2009</CitationRef>) examined the relationship between workload and health outcomes among health-care workers, and found that those with the heaviest workloads had greater odds of receiving treatment for both mental health and musculoskeletal disorders. Similarly, Hannigan, Edwards, and Burnard (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001236">2004</CitationRef>) found that 40 % of UK clinical psychologists were experiencing high levels of personal distress. Sources of stress were found to be related to client characteristics, excessive workloads, professional self-doubt, and poor management.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In response to new insights into issues related to job content, workload and their impact on employee health, there have been increased efforts within workplaces to monitor and report on possible imbalances (Strelioff, Lavoie-Tremblay, &amp; Barton, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001296">2007</CitationRef>). Such efforts have increased attention to situations of potential work overload or underload (boredom), and provided opportunities for ­professional development in order to maintain the health and well-being of workers, improving job performance and employee retention. These issues are especially pertinent during times of organizational restructuring when workloads and job content might undergo significant change.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Existing theoretical models highlight that job content and workload do not operate in isolation. Rather, social support in the workplace (Karasek &amp; Theorell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001246">1990</CitationRef>), systems of rewards and compensation (Siegrist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001290">1996</CitationRef>), and the amount of decision-making latitude or control workers have in the workplace (Karasek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001245">1979</CitationRef>) can moderate the impact that job content and workload have on the health and well-being of workers. That is, workers might tolerate or even thrive under conditions of high workload when they have adequate support, are sufficiently rewarded, compensated or recognized, when there is high job satisfaction, and if they have sufficient autonomy over their work.</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00124">
                <Heading>Choice and Control</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Choice and control have already been highlighted as key features of job design. Both theory and research within the workplace health literature suggest that choice and control (i.e., being able to actively participate in decision making at work) can counteract some of the negative effects of workplace demands and strain, and can contribute to a positive workplace climate. Drawing on national survey data from Sweden and the United States, Karasek (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001245">1979</CitationRef>) developed a well known model suggesting that the combination of low decision latitude and heavy job demand is associated with mental strain and job dissatisfaction. Job demand within this model refers to the previously discussed concept of workload and is comprised the quantity of work assigned to an individual, the time pressure experienced at work, and mental requirements for job completion. Individuals who experience high job demand might report feeling pressured to work fast and having difficulty taking time off work. Decision latitude, on the other hand, refers to the ability to make decisions or participate in decision-making at work, exercise discretion and autonomy, and be creative (Vezina, Bourbonnais, Brisson, &amp; Trudel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012101">2004</CitationRef>). Mental strain has been linked to health conditions such as depression, anxiety, apathy, distress, burnout, exhaustion, low self-esteem, drug use, and coronary disease (Leka &amp; Jain, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001259">2010</CitationRef>; <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012101">Vezina et al.</CitationRef>). Van Yperen and Snijders (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001298">2000</CitationRef>) reported on findings that begin to clarify the relationships and interactions involved in the Karasek model. Specifically, in their study of 260 employees in 31 working groups of a national bank in the Netherlands, these researchers found that it was the specific combination of an individual’s perception of his or her job demands being high compared to others, along with the group’s shared evaluation of job control being low that was associated with poorer health outcomes and greater number of sick days. These findings highlight that organizations should attend to worker perceptions of their job design including workload and the degree of control and choice they experience. Providing opportunities for workers to participate in decision-making affecting their work, and exercise control over their work conditions including their work schedule and how their work should be completed, will have a positive effect on health and well-being, and contribute to the creation of a positive work environment.</Para>

                <Heading>Role Ambiguity and Role Conflict</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The impact of role ambiguity and role conflict on well-being has been the topic of some research to date, and warrants further attention. Generally, role ambiguity refers to a lack of clarity about expected behavior from a job, whereas role conflict suggests a lack of compatibility between different expectations from a job. These variables have been shown to have negative impacts on a variety of outcomes. In a meta-analysis of research conducted on role ambiguity and role conflict in work settings, Jackson and Schuler (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001240">1985</CitationRef>) found that role ambiguity and role conflict were strongly correlated with affective reactions such as job satisfaction, tension/anxiety, commitment, involvement, and propensity to leave. Several studies have examined health outcomes in particular. For example, Jamal (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001241">1990</CitationRef>) found that role ambiguity was a variable that was significantly related to psychosomatic health problems in a sample of nurses, and Kelloway and Barling (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001249">1991</CitationRef>) found emotional exhaustion to occur under conditions of role ambiguity and role conflict. International studies have supported these findings. For example, in their study of job stressors and long-term sick leave due to depressive disorders among Japanese male employees, Inoue and colleagues (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0012110">2010</CitationRef>) concluded that role ambiguity was one of two variables (the other being job control) that predicted long-term sick leave due to depressive disorders among male employees, independent of depressive symptoms and neuroticism.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In light of these findings it is incumbent upon workplaces to find ways to avoid role ambiguity and conflict as a means of promoting psychosocial health amongst their employees. Having clear and reasonable expectations and sending clear and straightforward messages are important ways of doing so. To the greatest degree possible, jobs need to be described in explicit terms with regard to scope, responsibility, authority, standards of performance, and relationships with other jobs. This process involves communication among individuals, work teams and supervisors to avoid job misunderstanding and conflict. These discussions and interactions are important, as often job descriptions list formal job duties but say little about the more subtle and informal expectations of the roles (Handy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012111">1999</CitationRef>). To minimize role conflict, expectations should be consistent and account for employees’ multiple roles as well as personal value systems (Danna &amp; Griffin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001217">1999</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>The Physical Environment</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The physical work environment has received significant attention in the literature in terms of its contribution to the health and well-being of workers, worker turnover, absenteeism, and workplace productivity. In particular, there has been a focus on the physical design of work spaces and its relationship to repetitive strain and musculoskeletal injuries (Crawford, Gutierrez, &amp; Harber, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001215">2005</CitationRef>; Faucett, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001226">2005</CitationRef>). However, the physical work environment has broader implications for the health and productivity of workers. In a qualitative study by Arwedson, Roos, and Bjorklund (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00123">2007</CitationRef>) investigating the factors that contribute to the experience of good health at work, the participants emphasized how a good work environment, which includes natural lighting, cleanliness, and an aesthetically pleasing premise, contributes to well-being at work. These authors emphasized the importance of more psychosocial components such as a comfortable and pleasant atmosphere in the workplace in order to promote good mental health and well-being at work.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Many work organizations are implementing open-plan office designs where employees work together in large rooms, as opposed to private offices or enclosed rooms. Such physical work environments provide improved access to natural lighting for employees. Furthermore, open-plan office designs can be more conducive to team work, and support cooperation and communication among workers while reducing costs (de Croon, Sluiter, Kuijer, &amp; Frings-Dresen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001219">2005</CitationRef>; Kaarlela-Tuomaala, Helenius, Keskinen, &amp; Hongisto, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001244">2009</CitationRef>). However, such office designs provide less privacy, increased noise, and have been associated with difficulty concentrating on challenging tasks (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001219">de Croon et al.</CitationRef>; <CitationRef CitationID="CR001244">Kaarlela-Tuomaala et al.</CitationRef>). There is some evidence that open-plan office designs can be potential workplace stressors, compromising health, motivation, and performance (Vischer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012102">2007</CitationRef>), and limited evidence that such workplace designs intensify cognitive workload and compromise interpersonal relationships (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001219">de Croon et al.</CitationRef>). Meijer, Frings-Dresen, and Sluiter (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001269">2009</CitationRef>) evaluated the effects of an innovative open-plan office design on the health and productivity of 138 office workers at a Dutch regional governmental institute. Participants were individuals who worked at a desktop computer at least four hours per day. While there were no short-term significant differences in most outcomes, in the long-term, perceived productivity increased significantly, and there was a significant increase in general health. Conversely, Kaarlela-Tuomaala et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001244">2009</CitationRef>) evaluated the effects of moving from a private office design to an open-plan office space among professional workers. The move was associated with increased noise and distractions, reduced privacy, and increased concentration difficulties. Satisfaction with the work environment decreased after the relocation to the open-plan office. The benefits often associated with open-plan office designs did not transpire as cooperation became less pleasant and there was no change in communication or information flow.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">One of the purported benefits of open-plan office designs is improved access to natural lighting, windows and green space. Most of the evidence about the health benefits associated with access to natural lighting and green space comes from research beyond the workplace. However, a review on the effects of natural lighting in the workplace conducted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the United States has examined this issue in the workplace, and the findings suggest that workplace productivity increases and absenteeism decreases when a company moves into an office building with improved lighting and access to windows (Edwards &amp; Torcellini, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001223">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The mixed findings reported in the literature on open-plan office designs suggests that the type of worker and the work tasks involved are important, and both contribute the outcomes associated with different physical work environments. Although open-plan designs might facilitate communication, teamwork, and cooperation among workers, it can cause strain and stress among those whose primary tasks involve individual effort, high concentration, and require privacy. These findings are consistent with the framework for the study of work-space stress put forth by Vischer (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0012102">2007</CitationRef>) which highlights the importance of fit between the work environment, the workers, and the work tasks. A work environment can either support workers and the work tasks being performed (good fit), or hinder them (bad fit).</Para>

                <Heading>Work Schedule</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The work schedule is an important component of job design that contributes to the health and well-being of workers. Much of the literature to date has focused on the health consequences of shift work and working long hours. Specifically, research has highlighted that stress is common following extensive shift work, long hours of work, and interrupted sleep patterns (Leka &amp; Jain, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001259">2010</CitationRef>). There is a growing body of literature that highlights the deleterious effects of shift work and long working hours on health and well-being. In their review of the literature (this literature is also reviewed in another chapter in this handbook), Leka and Jain (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001259">2010</CitationRef>) highlight that the negative health consequences of shift work can be more pronounced among older workers and those with competing family responsibilities, while younger workers and those just beginning their careers seem to be most vulnerable to the effects of long working hours. Furthermore, Grosch, Caruso, Rosa, and Sauter (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001235">2006</CitationRef>) found that working long hours are also associated with greater job demands, greater control through participation in decision-making, and greater opportunity for workers to develop their own special abilities. Although job satisfaction was found to be greater among workers with long work hours, working more than 70 h per week was associated with adverse health and well-being outcomes. Shields (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001288">1999</CitationRef>) found that women who worked long hours had increased odds of subsequently experiencing depression, and increasing work hours was associated with increased weight gain among men, an increase in drinking among women, and an increase in smoking among both men and women. These findings suggest that individuals who enjoy their jobs might be more inclined to work long hours; however, too much overtime can have adverse effects on health and well-being.</Para>

                  <Heading>Flexible Work</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">In some workplaces, there are provisions within the job design for workers to choose their own hours and workspaces including the option of working from home. Such flexibility can be accommodating for workers who are balancing competing responsibilities or have unique scheduling needs, and provide workers with a degree of choice and control over their job. However, flexibility associated with contract work and other temporary work arrangements often leads to job insecurity and precariousness, factors that have been associated with negative health outcomes among workers (Clarke, Lewchuk, de Wolff, &amp; King, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001210">2007</CitationRef>; Lewchuk, Clarke, &amp; de Wolff, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001260">2008</CitationRef>). Furthermore, such job arrangements are often associated with fluctuating periods of intense work demands to meet pressing deadlines (MacEachen, Polzer, &amp; Clarke, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001264">2008</CitationRef>), and a lack of investment in the health promoting aspects of the work environment (Crawford et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001215">2005</CitationRef>). These findings suggest that flexible work schedules can have both positive and negative implications for the health and well-being of workers. It is most often associated with positive implications that allow for increased work–life balance, autonomy and control, and choice which can foster creativity and productivity. However, choice and control, which are most often considered a positive aspect of flexible work, can be circumvented by workplace demands and needs, competition, and the expectation that employees will work whenever they are needed in order to accomplish the organizational goals (Harlan &amp; Robert, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012109">1998</CitationRef>; <CitationRef CitationID="CR001264">MacEachen et al.</CitationRef>). The reality of flexible work is that it is also associated with long work hours, increased work intensity, lack of predictability in work demands, and blurred boundaries between home and worklife. <CitationRef CitationID="CR001264">MacEachen et al.</CitationRef> argue that the practice of flexible work environments often caters to the needs of the organization rather than the worker: “Flexibility in practice relies on and requires pliant workers who ‘willingly’ mould their lives according to the demands of work, and who are readily available at all times including evenings and weekend” (p. 1026). Thus, flexible work can promote health and accommodate individual needs in the workplace, as well as threaten workplace health and wellness.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Furthermore, the distancing of the individual worker from the workplace through the allowance of remote and flexible workspaces and hours make it easier for organizations to disassociate themselves from the resulting health consequences. MacEachen et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001264">2008</CitationRef>) found that the managers in their study interpreted the occupational health consequences of flexible work (such as stress, strain, and challenges balancing home and work responsibilities) as individual problems rather than a problem associated with job design. Although flexible work can help workers balance competing demands in their work and personal lives, it can also be a way of meeting the needs of the organization by ensuring that workers are available to work long hours and carry heavy workloads. The resulting stress, strain, and health consequences are seen as the individual’s personal concern, beyond the scope of the workplace.</Para>

                <Heading>Reward Systems</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Workers want to feel appreciated by their employers and their colleagues. There are many ways to reward employees including acknowledgement, recognition and pay incentives. In the late 1980s, Siegrist (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001290">1996</CitationRef>) proposed the “effort–reward imbalance” model based on findings that a work situation characterized by high effort and low reward is associated with poor health outcomes. Within the model, Siegrist further distinguished between extrinsic and intrinsic effort: extrinsic effort is associated with time pressures, interruptions, competing demands and responsibilities, and increased workload that arises from external sources; intrinsic effort or overcommitment is an internal attitude or innate drive to push forward and gain esteem or approval. According to this model, reward is primarily measured in terms of salary, esteem/respect, and job security/opportunity for advancement (Siegrist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001291">2002</CitationRef>). The central process or mechanism of action is social reciprocity, the possibility of gaining or earning advantage as a result of effort expended in the workplace.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The effort/reward imbalance model has been applied to the study of precarious employment where individuals exert effort but continue to experience job insecurity and unpredictability (Clarke et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001210">2007</CitationRef>; Crawford et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001215">2005</CitationRef>; Lewchuk et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001260">2008</CitationRef>; MacEachen et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001264">2008</CitationRef>; Vezina et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012101">2004</CitationRef>), or are seen as disposable and thus tolerate unreasonable working conditions or expectations in an effort to maintain their job or get a promotion (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001264">MacEachen et al.</CitationRef>; <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012101">Vezina et al.</CitationRef>). Such work situations have been associated with poor health outcomes, including increased anxiety, depression, substance use, and high blood pressure (Siegrist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001291">2002</CitationRef>; Stansfeld, Fuhrer, Shipley, &amp; Marmot, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001294">1999</CitationRef>; <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012101">Vezina et al.</CitationRef>). According to a review of the evidence supporting the model, Siegrist (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001291">2002</CitationRef>) argued that 10–40 % of the workforce suffers from some degree of effort/reward imbalance. Based on longitudinal measures from a cohort of civil servants in the UK, Kruper, Singh-Manoux, Siegrist, and Marmot (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001254">2002</CitationRef>) showed that effort–reward imbalance is associated with an increased risk of functional disability from mental health problems and a moderately elevated risk of newly reported mild psychiatric disorders.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">These findings suggest that organizations should consider how to best reward, recognize and compensate employees for their efforts and achievements. For example, salaries, wages, benefits, and bonus structures should be kept in line with efforts and contributions made by employees. Furthermore, organizations should invest in nonmonetary rewards such as ensuring there are adequate job promotion opportunities and job security. Unfortunately, some sectors of the labor market or organizational structures rely on short-term contractual work arrangements and are unable to offer such rewards to their workers. Such workers are often particularly vulnerable and at risk for poor health outcomes.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">The importance of leadership in contributing to healthy work environments has been demonstrated across cultures, sectors and geographic boundaries. Leadership in the context of the workplace describes the overall supervisory or management style, and characterizes the culture of the organization by setting standards, norms, and expectations. It encompasses organizational justice in terms of the treatment of employees, social support through demonstrated concern for subordinates, and workplace transformation through mechanism of stimulation and motivation. Studies have examined the relationship between leadership and health and well-being at work. Kuoppala, Lamminpaa, Liira, and Vainio (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001255">2008</CitationRef>) conducted a systematic literature review of 27 studies and found moderate evidence that good leadership is associated with improved job well-being, a decreased risk of sick absence, and a decreased risk of disability pension. Furthermore, there was weak evidence that good leadership is associated with job satisfaction but not job performance. Thus, the authors concluded that the available evidence suggests that good leadership contributes to job satisfaction and job well-being, and decreases the risk of sick leaves and early retirement. According to these authors, strong leaders, especially during times of rapid organizational change, can energize and satisfy needs for achievement and recognition.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">What are the qualities of a leader that can promote health in the workplace? There is a vast literature on styles of leadership and qualities of an effective leader but far less that examines traits as they relate to workplace health. Some research in the health care domain discusses “authentic leadership” as a key ingredient for establishing and sustaining healthy work environments and the “glue” needed to hold together a healthy work environment. Avolio, Gardner, Walumbwa, Luthans, and May (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00124">2004</CitationRef>) define authentic leaders as “those individuals who are deeply aware of how they think and behave and are perceived by others as being aware of their own and others’ values/moral perspective, knowledge, and strengths, aware of the context in which they operate, and who are confident, hopeful, optimistic, resilient, and high on moral character” (2004, p. 804). Authentic leaders have the attributes of genuineness, trustworthiness, reliability, compassion, and believability, and create healthy work environments by engaging employees in promoting positive behavior (Shirey, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001289">2006</CitationRef>). Additional qualities of authentic leaders have been identified by Lohela, Bjorklund, Vingard, Hagberg, and Jensen (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001261">2009</CitationRef>). In their study of 1,212 employees from four medium and large companies in Sweden, they found that changes in leadership in terms of fairness, empowerment, and the provision of social support, impact the health of subordinate workers. These findings suggest that good leadership can support workplace mental health and should be promoted in all workplaces. Indeed, leadership training programs are now common in workplaces and research across various sectors shows that they have a positive effect. For example, an 8-year evaluation of leadership development programs in the field of public health shows positive results on the personal, organizational and community levels (Woltring, Constantine, &amp; Schwarte, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012107">2003</CitationRef>). Effective leaders can energize employees, provide a vision and support employees in their efforts at work.</Para>

              <Heading>Organizational Culture</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Organizational culture is an important construct in understanding the experiences of individuals in the workplace. Defined as the shared values, beliefs, and expectations among members of an organization (Moran &amp; Volkwein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001270">1992</CitationRef>; Spataro, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001293">2005</CitationRef>), the culture of an organization shapes much of what occurs within it and acts as an informal system of control. Specifically, organizational culture dictates norms, rules of behavior, expectations of members, how problems and challenges are addressed, and the integration of new members and members who are different (Spataro, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001293">2005</CitationRef>). The culture of an organization emerges through the complex and continuous communication and interaction among members both within and across organizational structures (Keyton, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001250">2005</CitationRef>). Schein (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001284">1992</CitationRef>) refers to culture as “a basic set of assumptions that defines for us what we pay attention to, what things mean, how to react emotionally to what is going on, and what actions to take in various kinds of situations” (p. 22). In short, organizational culture has been identified as the central factor that holds the modern organization together (Goffee &amp; Jones, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001231">1996</CitationRef>). Within this broad concept, the safety culture of an organization has been recognized as being an important determinant of the safety and health of employees. This has held true primarily for physical health and safety, but it is becoming clear that organizational culture has a major impact on psychological or mental health as well. Components of the organizational culture that are influential in this regard are communication, meaningful participation or employee involvement, organizational fairness, social support, a psychological health and safety ­climate, and an emphasis on work–life balance.</Para>

                <Heading>Communication</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Communication in the workplace is a critical factor influencing the mental health of its workers. Poor communication engenders confusion, anxiety, potential conflict with peers and in some cases, feelings of disconnection and exclusion. Surveys show that poor communication causes increases in workplace stress, absenteeism and turnover (Walters, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012104">2005</CitationRef>). In contrast, effective communication enables trust and cooperation to develop in the workplace, thereby fostering support and harmonious work relations. Through clear and effective communication, information is shared, workers feel included and morale improves. Identifying elements of effective communication in the workplace has been the topic of much discussion, and there appears to be agreement on a core set of principles and practices. Research by Robbins (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001278">2001</CitationRef>) and Young and Post (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0012108">1993</CitationRef>) identifies a set of five principal communication practices common to companies with high trust cultures: (1) managers explain why decisions are made; (2) communication occurs in a timely manner; (3) important information flows continuously; (4) direct supervisors and other leaders explain the specific implications of environmental and organizational changes to each level of workers; and (5) employee responses to leader communications are validated. Honest, timely, current and consistent information-sharing is central to building trust and feelings of security within the workplace, and empowers employees by giving them the information they need to be productive in their work. In their book, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace</Emphasis>, Reina and Reina (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001276">1999</CitationRef>) discuss information-sharing as a principal component of their Communication Trust Model.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Active listening, skillful inquiry and receptiveness are components of effective communication that have also been deemed to be essential to workplaces and to leaders in particular. Active listening includes such behaviors as empathetic body language that is consistent with verbal messages, validating others’ statements, enabling others to express their thoughts without unnecessary interruption, and paraphrasing to ensure mutual understanding (Robbins &amp; Hunsaker, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001279">1996</CitationRef>). Skillful inquiry, or asking good, helpful questions is a facet of active listening and conveys an interest in learning more about the issue at hand as well as the valuing of others’ ideas. The creation of an open and receptive environment is created through such communication strategies, with benefits to workers’ sense of well-being.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">While the impact of information-sharing on worker well-being has been highlighted time and time again, the pace at which information is currently being transmitted within workplaces is increasing rapidly and the impact of this change has yet to play out. Today’s organizations use a variety of communication media including email, teleconferencing, videoconferencing, and more recently, Instant Messaging (IM). Using a case study approach, Cameron and Webster (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00129">2004</CitationRef>) investigated Instant Messaging and its use in organizations and found that IM was perceived to be much less rich than face-to-face communication and carried with it some potential dangers. Employees using IM engaged in multiple forms of multitasking, leading the authors to question the impact of completing multiple communication tasks at the same time on performance and working relationships. Further, results demonstrate that IM interrupts employee work patterns and employees see its interruptive nature as unfair. Schabracq and Cooper (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001283">2000</CitationRef>) insist that when events interfere with work routines and goals, the result is a sense of loss of control. As such, these events can be serious sources of stress with cumulative effects on individual well-being and health. The impact of rapidly developing information and communication technologies in the workplace is yet to be determined, and its effects on workers’ mental health is a particularly important line of inquiry.</Para>

                <Heading>Meaningful Participation/Involvement</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Employee involvement is a commonly cited healthy workplace practice that enables workers to bring a diverse set of ideas and perspectives to bear on solving organizational problems and increasing organizational effectiveness (Grawitch, Gottschalk, &amp; Munz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001233">2006</CitationRef>). Employee-involvement programs involve employees in decision making, and focus on such aspects as job autonomy, self-managed work teams, and empowerment (e.g., Cohen, Ledford, &amp; Spreitzer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001212">1996</CitationRef>; Karasek &amp; Theorell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001246">1990</CitationRef>; Lawler, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001258">1991</CitationRef>). Such strategies have been shown to produce positive consequences for both employee well-being and organizational effectiveness alike (e.g., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001258">Lawler</CitationRef>; Vandenberg, Richardson, &amp; Eastman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001299">1999</CitationRef>). Research demonstrates a relationship between employee involvement in decision making and employee variables, such as job satisfaction and employee morale. A study by Freeman and Rogers (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001228">1999</CitationRef>) demonstrated a significant difference between employee involvement program participants and nonparticipants, with the former reporting higher levels of loyalty and commitment to their organization, increased job satisfaction, and a more positive view of management than the latter group. Simmering, Colquitt, Noe, and Porter (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001292">2003</CitationRef>) found evidence that employee involvement in specific development activities leads to greater perceptions of “fit” than lower levels of involvement. Furthermore, Grawitch, Trares, and Kohler (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001234">2007</CitationRef>) found that satisfaction with employee involvement mediated the relationship between several healthy workplace practices (such as employee development, recognition, work–life balance, and health and safety programs) and the employee outcomes of organizational commitment and emotional exhaustion.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">High involvement organizations create a culture of involvement and support by providing sufficient information, training, rewards, and power for employees to demonstrate the desired level of autonomy (Lawler, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001258">1991</CitationRef>). Opportunities for workers to provide feedback on work processes and goals offer them a voice in the workplace and empower them. Roebuck (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001280">1996</CitationRef>) refers to such feedback as “soft feedback”, defined as “information obtained from individuals that relates to ideas, opinions or perceptions and therefore requires them to make a choice as to whether or not to give it” (p. 328). Such soft feedback enables employees to identify problems hindering them in their work and may allow employees to perform better and to feel better. Workplace-based research by Roebuck (1990) indicates that requests for feedback along with a positive response and action by management have the effect of “reciprocation of concern” (p. 329), whereby employees feel that management has made positive efforts towards them and they respond positively in return. The consequences, according to Roebuck and others, include increased motivation, commitment and an improved organizational culture that contributes to the well-being of employees and organizations alike. While reciprocation of concern is the goal, oftentimes employee involvement efforts leave employees feeling more manipulated than motivated (McConnell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012112">1998</CitationRef>). McConnell explains that this occurs because employee input, even when solicited, is often discounted, ignored, or altered to fit the manager’s preconceptions. He ­suggests that managers learn to provide involvement opportunities, accompanied by clear outcome expectations, and allow employees the freedom to pursue those outcomes in their own way.</Para>

                <Heading>Organizational Justice and Fairness</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Organizational justice is an important component of organizational culture. It has emerged in recent organizational literature on psychosocial risk factors in the workplace, and is composed of both relational and procedural components. The relational component refers to the extent to which supervisors consider the points of view of their employee and treat subordinates fairly; procedural components refer specifically to fairness within formal decision-making processes (Elovainio, Kivimaki, &amp; Vahtera, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001224">2002</CitationRef>; Kivimaki, Elovainio, Vahtera, &amp; Ferrie, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001251">2003</CitationRef>; Kivimaki et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001252">2004</CitationRef>). Although related to previously discussed job design components, such as work demands, control and social support, organizational justice is focused on the social structure of the organization as opposed to the individual worker. Research on organizational justice has generally reported a linear relationship, where lower levels of justice were associated with lower measures of well-being. For example, drawing on data collected as part of the prospective Whitehall II study of 10,308 mostly white collar British civil servants between 1985 and 1988, Kivimaki et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001252">2004</CitationRef>) found that low and declining relational justice is predictive of decreasing health, and favorable changes in the treatment of employees was associated with reduced health risk. Similar findings were reported by Kivimaki et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001251">2003</CitationRef>) who described findings from a longitudinal study among Finnish hospital personnel. Although <CitationRef CitationID="CR001251">Kivimaki et al.</CitationRef> noted that low procedural and relational justice equally increased the likelihood of illness, for procedural justice there was an interaction with socioeconomic status. Furthermore, mental health problems and self-rated health status were more strongly predicted by procedural as opposed to relational components of organizational justice.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Fairness, another component of organizational justice, has also been studied in terms of its effect on health and well-being of workers. Shain (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001286">2001</CitationRef>) has proposed that a key factor linking complex factors that are known to influence health and well-being at work is the perception of fairness. That is, the feeling among workers that workplace conditions are constructed, not by chance, but by intentional choices made by managers in light of the needs of workers. By reviewing the research exploring the health effects of power relationships, Shain argues that workers respond differently to the stress that might result from the sense of being treated unfairly. For some, it might lead to experiences of depression, anxiety, or anger (with associated implications for overall health and well-being). According to Shain, poor health outcomes such as depression and anxiety, can impair performance and lead to increased aggression, substance abuse, and physical illnesses. Such outcomes can increase absenteeism and lead to increased workplace health costs. According to Shain:

These authors hypothesized that the perception of fairness might be a particularly salient contributor to health among blue-collar workers whose job may offer fewer resources for their well-being compared to white-collar workers.</Para>

                <Heading>Social Support</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Relationships with coworkers have the potential to be stressful with many negative consequences, or supportive, with numerous benefits to psychological health and well-being. Studies have found that mistrust of coworkers is related to high role ambiguity, poor communication, low job satisfaction, and poor psychosocial well-being (summarized by Cooper &amp; Cartwright, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001214">1994</CitationRef>). Strong emotions, such as workplace jealousy and envy amongst employees, have been associated with such detrimental outcomes as workplace violence and harrassment (Vecchio, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012100">1995</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">On the flip side, much research has demonstrated the benefits of social support with regard to enhanced coping and well-being. Social support is broadly defined as helping relationships in the workplace and it is often thought to moderate the experience of stress and strain in the workplace (Dejonge, Jansen, &amp; Vanbreukelen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001220">1996</CitationRef>; Johnson &amp; Hall, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001243">1988</CitationRef>; Karasek, Triantis, &amp; Chaudhry, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001247">1982</CitationRef>). The Karasek model, discussed earlier in this chapter, as well as in another chapter of this handbook, was expanded to include social support after its initial development, in order to highlight that emotional integration, trust among coworkers and supervisors, the social cohesion of organization, and the availability of help and assistance at work, can “buffer” the poor health outcomes associated with high demand and low control among workers (Karasek &amp; Theorell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001246">1990</CitationRef>). However, some researchers have argued that social support at work has a more direct effect on workplace health than can be explained by the “buffer hypothesis.” They argue that social support can either reduce the level of strain experienced, regardless of the intensity of the stressors encountered, or that the experience of strain or stress can elicit social support. For example, Viswesvaran, Sanchez, and Fisher (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0012103">1999</CitationRef>) reported in a meta-analysis of 68 studies that social support affects the work stressor–strain relationship in three ways: (1) social support reduces the experience of strain; (2) social support reduces the strength of the stressors; and (3) social support moderates the stressor–strain relationship.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Regardless of the mechanism by which social support operates—as a buffer or directly—accumulating evidence highlights its important effects on workplace health and well-being. For example, in a 2-year longitudinal study conducted by Plaisier et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001274">2007</CitationRef>), the risks for incidence of depressive and anxiety disorders tended to decrease under the conditions of high daily emotional support in combination with high levels of decision latitude, but tended to increase when both decision latitude and daily emotional support were low. Marchand, Demers, and Durand (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001265">2005</CitationRef>) found that social support at work had an effect on preventing relapses of psychosocial distress, but had no effect on the risk of a first episode. Among British civil servants, Stansfeld, Rael, Head, Shipley, and Marmot (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001295">1997</CitationRef>) found that support from colleagues and supervisors at work were related to lower risk of short spells of psychiatric sickness absence. These findings highlight the important role that social support at work plays in creating healthy workplaces that support worker health and well-being.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The nature of support and its impact has also been examined, albeit to a lesser extent. Ducharme and Martin (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001221">2000</CitationRef>) isolated coworkers’ relationships from supervisor-subordinate relationships, and tested the effects of two forms of coworker support—instrumental and affective—on levels of job satisfaction. They found that both affective and instrumental support contributed significantly to explanations of workers’ affective reactions to their job demands, and concluded that both forms of support enhance job satisfaction and well-being regardless of the amount of job stress encountered. These authors suggest that “systematic efforts to promote both affiliative and practical ties among coworkers will enhance worker affect” (p. 240). Similarly, Beehr, Jex, Stacy, and Murray (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00125">2000</CitationRef>) conceptualized social support in terms of emotional and instrumental types, but also included a third dimension—content of communication—as an expression of support. They found that social support predicted levels of psychosocial strain, and that the specific social support measure that had the strongest effect on strain reduction was the use of positive, job-related communications.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">These workplace-based studies are consistent with findings in the broader literature on the benefits of social support. They speak to the importance of incorporating opportunities for several forms of coworker support (affective support, instrumental support, and positive work-related communication) into the workplace. To this end, it is not only important for workplaces to arrange social activities, such as gatherings that enable emotional and affective engagement, but also to implement efforts aimed at building effective work teams that enhance coworkers’ abilities and opportunities to provide on-the-job assistance, advice, and information (instrumental support). In addition, a culture of respectful communication that is positive and encouraging adds to the powerful benefits of social support as it relates to mental health and well-being.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The influence of social relations and social support on the health and well-being of workers is particularly relevant given current conditions of precarious employment and short-term, insecure employment prevalent in many sectors of the labor market (Clarke et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001210">2007</CitationRef>; Crawford et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001215">2005</CitationRef>; Lewchuk et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001260">2008</CitationRef>; MacEachen et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001264">2008</CitationRef>). The findings reported by Clarke et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001210">2007</CitationRef>) in a qualitative study on the health effects of different types of precarious employment at different life/career stages suggest that the most vulnerable workers, those in precarious work situations that were described as “unsustainable,” were in the greatest need of social support but had the least access to it. These findings suggest that many current work arrangements could threaten worker health by restricting opportunities to establish positive social relationships at work.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Currently, many workplaces are moving towards creating cultures that emphasize psychological health in ways that could be classified, using Gilbert and Bilsker’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001230">2011</CitationRef>) framework, as promotion or prevention. While implementation of these stages alone is insufficient for a sustainable culture of psychological health and safety, there have been many benefits that have resulted from such efforts. Two reviews of studies on the impact of health promotion programs (Aldana, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00122">2001</CitationRef>; Golaszewski, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001232">2001</CitationRef>) found that, across studies, health promotion programs were related to lower absenteeism and health care expenditures.</Para>

The establishment of Employee Assistance Programs (EAP; comprehensively reviewed in another chapter of this handbook), such as alcohol or drug abuse counseling, has also been shown to yield positive organizational results, including a reduction in employee absences and accidents (McFarlin &amp; Fals-Stewart, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001268">2002</CitationRef>). A study examining EAP outcomes on 60,000 clients at US Federal Occupational Health revealed statistically significant improvement from pre- to post-EAP intervention on a number of measures, including work productivity as affected by emotional problems, the interference of emotional issues on work and social relationships, perceived health status, job attendance and global assessment of functioning (Selviket, Stephenson, Plaza, &amp; Sugden, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001285">2004</CitationRef>). Furthermore, as pointed out by Grawitch et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001233">2006</CitationRef>), implementation of programs that promote health and safety are a form of organizational support, and perceived organizational support has been linked to fulfillment of employees socio-emotional needs, higher job performance (Erdogan &amp; Enders, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001225">2007</CitationRef>; Witt &amp; Carlson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012106">2006</CitationRef>), organizational citizenship behaviors (Piercy, Cravens, Lane, &amp; Vorhies, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001273">2006</CitationRef>), commitment and reduced turnover (Loi, Hang-yue, &amp; Foley, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001262">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">An important component of a psychologically safe and healthy workplace is the implementation of a pro active approach to eliminating the stigma towards mental health problems that may exist in the workplace. In the workplace, stigma can produce social conditions that undermine individual efforts to meet work requirements while maintaining personal health and integrity. Many employees are reluctant to come forward and disclose a mental health problem, choosing to go untreated rather than risk being labelled as “unreliable, unproductive or untrustworthy.” Krupa, Kirsh, Cockburn, and Gewurtz (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001253">2009</CitationRef>) developed a conceptual model identifying assumptions that underlie stigma in the workplace. These assumptions revolve around notions of competence, dangerousness, legitimacy of the illness, and work as charity. Their model suggests that concerns related to task and social performance on the job influence the disposition to act in a discriminatory manner in workplaces, and that assumptions are more or less relevant to people holding different positions in the work place. Reducing or even eradicating stigma in the workplace requires a fundamental culture change to create an environment where people feel free to discuss issues openly, and to seek support and help when needed. Workplaces must review their human resource policies, practices, and behaviors to ensure that they are aligned to support the organizational changes needed for stigma reduction. Attention to reducing stigma in all phases of the employment process is warranted in order to ensure that stigma and discrimination are not at play in: hiring; achieving promotions; accessing full employment benefits; and engagement in day-to-day social interactions on the job. Workplace education about mental illness and mental health is also important in order to dismantle stereotypes and promote attitudes of acceptance and inclusion.</Para>

Work–life conflict occurs when the time and energy demands imposed by our many roles become incompatible with one another. Studies show that employees who experience work–life conflict are significantly less committed to the organization, less satisfied with their jobs, and report higher levels of job stress, absenteeism, EAP use, prescription drug use and intent to turnover (Burton, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00128">2002</CitationRef>). Higgins and Duxbury (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001238">2009</CitationRef>) found that conflict between work and family roles diminish employees’ perceptions of quality of both work and family life. To prevent such negative consequences, organizations can implement work–life balance programs that help individuals balance the multiple demands of their lives.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Research by Scandura and Lankau (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001282">1997</CitationRef>) demonstrated that the existence of work–life programs was positively related to organizational commitment and job satisfaction. Crooker and Grover (1993) maintain that providing family benefits to employees is a symbolic action on the part of the employer that demonstrates sensitivity and responsiveness to employees’ needs, and that employees may reciprocate with greater loyalty and better morale. While most work–life balance programs are constructed with families in mind by emphasizing elder or child care, Grawitch et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001233">2006</CitationRef>) point out that a narrow focus on the family excludes those employees who do not have such demands, but may have other responsibilities in their personal lives that require flexibility. They recommend that the exclusive category of family support programs be redefined into a more inclusive category of work–life balance programs that can provide all employees with the flexibility required to meet the demands of their work and personal lives. Gilbert and Bilsker (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001230">2011</CitationRef>) do this by categorizing a number of effective actions that can help maintain work–life balance into two broad areas:
<OrderedList>

                      <ItemNumber>1.</ItemNumber>
                      <ItemContent>
                        <Para TextBreak="No">Inclusive and flexible employee supports may involve providing extended benefits to employee’s partners and family members, allowing employees to choose benefits that fit their needs (e.g., support for eldercare versus childcare), flexible work schedules, work from home on certain days, or replacement of “sick days” with flexible “personal days.”</Para>

                      <ItemContent>
                        <Para TextBreak="No">Building employee skills to manage work-home conflict can be accomplished by using staff meetings, company newsletters and/or “lunch and learns” to provide information and training. Specific skills may focus on the job (e.g., time management, organizational skills, coping with stress) or upon personal life (e.g., financial planning, child or eldercare issues). This broad and inclusive approach to work life balance communicates universal concern and addresses the competing demands of life for all employees.</Para>

              <Heading>Job Future</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Job Future represents a multidimensional domain that has been identified in models of healthy work organization (see for example, Wilson et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0012105">2004</CitationRef>). It is about worker expectations for the future within their jobs and their organizations. Two dimensions that comprise this domain are job security and career development.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec001219">
                <Heading>Job Security</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The level of certainty associated with future employment opportunities, job security and the capacity to find and keep a job can have significant effects on the health and well-being of workers. Short-term, casual contracts are common work arrangements in Western labor markets. Although sometimes desired and sought out by employees, short-term work arrangements can restrict the development of supportive social relationships at work, and can put workers in precarious and stressful work situations where they do not have a reliable or predictable source of income. Job insecurity is often associated with lower self-reported health (Borg, Kristensen, &amp; Burr, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00126">2000</CitationRef>; Ferrie, Shipley, Stansfeld, &amp; Marmot, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001227">2002</CitationRef>; McDonough, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001267">2000</CitationRef>; Rugulies, Bültmann, Aust, &amp; Burr, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001281">2006</CitationRef>). Furthermore, such work arrangements can interrupt and disrupt social and familial pursuits because of uncertainty related to employment and income.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Lewchuk et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001260">2008</CitationRef>) and Clarke et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001210">2007</CitationRef>) explored the health implications associated with precarious/insecure employment arrangements. While Lewchuk and colleagues found that the health profiles of workers in precarious/insecure employment arrangements were not consistently different or poorer than workers in permanent/secure employment arrangement, Clarke et al. found that the health effects of insecure employment varied by the reasons for the employment situation. The poorest health outcomes were reported among individuals who were in precarious/insecure employment arrangements, wanted more secure employment but were unable to find any, did not see how they could change their employment situation and had low expectations that it would change in the near future. Individuals in such “unsustainable” precarious employment arrangements have a hard time planning and organizing their finances and are often restricted in their capacity to socialize, move out on their own, take planned time off work, and make childcare arrangements. These individuals were distinguished from two other groups of workers in precarious employment situations: those “on-a-path” who saw their current precarious employment arrangement as temporary or a stepping stone to their career; and those who were in “sustainable” precarious employment situations that either offered desired flexibility or rewards. Clarke and colleagues found that precarious workers in the “unsustainable” and “on-a-path” groups were more likely to report that work was stressful, being tense at work more frequently in the last month, and that they experienced a range of health problems related to work. The workers in the “unsustainable” group in particular were more likely to report deteriorating health and a range of both physical and mental health problems. Thus, the perception of job security and the level of choice and control the worker has over their job security and work arrangement has an important influence on the mental health and well-being of workers.</Para>

                <Heading>Career Development</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Work is a major source of identity and self-esteem, so it is understandable that opportunities for growth and development translate into higher job satisfaction and an increased sense of wellness. Employee growth and development programs provide employees with the opportunity to expand their knowledge, skills, and abilities, and to apply the competencies they have gained to new ­situations (e.g., Jamison &amp; O’Mara, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001242">1991</CitationRef>; Pfeffer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001272">1998</CitationRef>). Examples of employee growth and development ­programs include the following: continuing education courses; tuition reimbursement; career development or counseling services; skills training provided in-house or through outside training centers; opportunities for promotion and internal career advancement; and leadership development.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Kaye (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001248">2010</CitationRef>) insists that “high engagement starts with career development” (p. 4), and advises companies wishing to boost satisfaction, productivity and engagement to ensure that people are in the right jobs, doing the right work, enjoying it, following a career development plan and having access to relevant tools and training. She maintains that, in order for this to happen, organizations should teach employees how to assess their skills, interests, and values and help them understand how they are viewed. Organizations should inform employees of what is happening in the company that may change how they work so as to encourage new possibilities and multiple options. In addition, companies must offer tools to create an action plan so that employees can achieve their goals. Effective career development involves assessing gaps, seeking feedback to improve capabilities, mining for career opportunities, and developing by growing in place, self-marketing, and action planning (Kaye, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001248">2010</CitationRef>). Opportunities for career development and learning can act as a motivator for employees and enhance job satisfaction. In an analysis of five human resource practices, Browne (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00127">2000</CitationRef>) found training and internal career opportunities to be significant predictors of job satisfaction and job stress. Positive benefits associated with employee growth and development programs are realized by organizations as they provide employees a chance to apply the knowledge and skills acquired during development (Pfeffer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001271">1994</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusion and Future Directions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">This chapter has presented work-related factors known to affect the mental health of workers. These factors emerge from empirical research on workplace health, and have been organized into a framework consisting of four domains: Job Design, Organizational Culture, Leadership and Job Future. Within each of these domains are a number of variables that interact with one another to affect mental health. These key variables have implications for workers, employers and policymakers. Armed with information about how to contribute to the development of a psychologically healthy workplace, workers can consider how they may create a satisfying balance between job demands and control, between effort and reward, and between the many demands of work and life. Additionally, they may attend more closely to the creation of supportive environments and ensure that roles and communication within teams are clear and explicit. Employers and human resources professionals can then use this knowledge to develop and implement workplace policies and procedures that consider effective reward systems, clarify roles and expectations, promote career development and embed organizational fairness and support into the culture of the organization. Governments and policymakers can also draw on this information for the creation of national or provincial standards that encourage workplaces to assess and minimize psychological risks for employees.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">While much is now known about constructing mentally healthy workplaces, the field is young and has many more issues to address. For example, as the nature of work changes, with virtual and global work increasing in prevalence, new questions about work–life balance, job security, and the impact of “place” on psychological well-being must be addressed. Additionally, while some research exists in specific work sectors, there are others that call for increased attention, particularly those that are emerging and those that are gradually disappearing from the landscape of the labor market. Finally, much research is yet to be done on workplace factors that promote successful return-to-work for those who have had to leave the workplace due to mental health issues. Research and action in these areas can contribute to a reduction in the growing rates of mental distress in the workplace and can lead to a healthier and more productive workforce.</Para>
