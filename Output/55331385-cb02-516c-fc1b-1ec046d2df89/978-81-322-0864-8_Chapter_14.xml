          <Para TextBreak="No">In the experimental research arena, the phrase good laboratory practice or GLP specifically refers to a quality system of management controls for research laboratories and organisations to try to ensure the uniformity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility, quality and integrity of chemical (including pharmaceuticals) non-clinical safety tests, from physiochemical properties through acute to chronic toxicity tests. GLP was instituted after animal tests were not positive by pharmaceutical and industrial chemical (mainly pesticide) manufacturers. GLP is a quality system concerned with the organisational processing process and conditions under which non-clinical health and environmental safety studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded, archived and reported. The primary products of any laboratory concerned with chemical analysis are the analytical data reported for specimens examined by that laboratory. Quality assurance (QA) for such a laboratory includes all of the activities associated with insuring that chemical and physical measurements are made properly, interpreted correctly and reported with appropriate estimates of error and confidence levels. QA activities also include those maintaining appropriate records of specimen/sample origins and history (sample tracking), as well as procedures, raw data and results associated with each specimen/sample. The laboratory’s personnel should be trained on safe hygienic practices like hand washing, wearing protective clothing, gloves and eye protection. Laboratories are classified into four levels of biosafety laboratories. Every laboratory should ascertain to which category they belong to and take appropriate steps to protect the laboratory. The laboratory waste also should be properly segregated according to the biomedical waste rules and should be disposed as per the existing law.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">In the experimental research arena, the phrase good laboratory practice or GLP specifically refers to a quality system of management controls for research laboratories and organisations to try to ensure the uniformity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility, quality and integrity of chemical (including pharmaceuticals) non-clinical safety tests, from physiochemical properties through acute to chronic toxicity tests.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">GLP was instituted after animal tests were not positive by pharmaceutical and industrial chemical (mainly pesticide) manufacturers. Industrial Bio-Test Labs (IBT) was the most notable case, where thousands of safety tests for chemical manufacturers were falsely claimed to have been performed or were so poor that police investigators could not piece together what work had been done even though IBT superficially delivered the test results their contracts with the manufacturers specified (Schneider <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">1983</CitationRef>). The original GLP regulatory mandate was promulgated in 1978 by US-FDA and published in the Federal Register 43 FR 59985-60020. It was followed by a few years later by US-EPA (as outlined in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Principles of GLP in 1992). The OECD has since help promulgate it to many countries, helping them to place it into their national regulations. GLP applies to non-clinical studies conducted for the assessment of the safety or efficacy of chemicals (including pharmaceuticals) to man, animals and the environment. Good laboratory practice (GLP) embodies a set of principles that provide a framework within which laboratory studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived. These studies are undertaken to generate data by which the hazards and risks to users, consumers and third parties, including the environment, can be assessed for pharmaceuticals (only preclinical studies), agrochemicals, cosmetics, food additives, feed additives and contaminants, novel foods, biocides, detergents, etc. GLP helps to assure regulatory authorities that the data submitted are a true reflection of the results obtained during the study and can therefore be relied upon when making risk/safety assessments. GLP, a data quality system, should not be confused with standards for laboratory safety—appropriate gloves, glasses and clothing to handle laboratory materials safely.</Para>

          <Heading>Criticism of GLP</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">GLP studies require adequate and permanent documentation of everything involved in an experimental test (staff qualifications, valid study design, standard operating procedures (SOPs), training, performance, formulation and statistical analysis and the retention of summary/individual data) so that there can be confidence in the study design, performance and its results and anyone (as public agencies have access to the GLP records) can subsequently fully reconstruct the study. GLP is by most regulatory authorities worldwide adopted as the lowest common standard for quality assurance. ISO 17025, GMP or GCP criteria are alternatives in some cases.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">OECD Guideline test methods are recommended by regulatories as study plan to follow for toxicology studies. These methods are all very standardised/extensively peer reviewed and are adopted worldwide. Independent of the test guidelines, GLP is recommended by the authorities to assure the correct execution of these study plans. The correct execution of GLP study is verified by an independent GLP monitoring authority on a regular basis. This verification means an <Emphasis Type="Italic">in situ</Emphasis> inspection of the whole test facility and connected test sites worldwide. Audits of the studies registered with unrestricted access to all raw data produced during the whole study are a part of the inspection. In this sense it means a much deeper peer review of the study is done for an academic publication.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">By contrast, academic scientists perform a wider range of basic/exploratory experimental research to identify unknown potential hazards of chemicals, elucidate the mode/mechanism of action for known toxicants and explore novel toxic end points. Accordingly, their experimental methods vary greatly in the delivery route of the test chemical, the number of test animals and the range of doses (Tweedale <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2011</CitationRef>). These test methods are far more varied than the GLP test protocol is and academics do not like to share their results or methods with laboratories competing for granting money or to give insight in raw data produced. These factors make it hard for regulatory agencies to use the results of academic researchers in chemical risk assessment.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The problem is the regulatory agencies universal requirement that toxicity studies be performed according to OECD/GLP protocols automatically excludes the toxicity results of the independent researchers. The latter’s methods, though variable, do test more realistic doses than the OECD protocols use. Thus, if they find toxicity at lower doses, that important risk is not included in the risk assessment, due to the GLP requirement. Tens of thousands of published findings of toxicity from chronic toxicity have been excluded from risk assessment, a large fraction of which find toxicity at lower dose than OECD tests.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Reviews of toxicity studies have confirmed that this false-negative error is common: Dozens of reviews have confirmed it for Guideline tests of pharmaceuticals, while for chemicals at least four reviewers have found it. In one of these, the toxicity studies funded by the manufacturers of a high-volume and well-studied chemical never found low-dose toxicity, but over 90% of its many government-funded studies did (vom Saal and Hughes <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2005</CitationRef>). The specific factors that lead to such false-negative error by OECD/GLP studies have been analysed (Myers et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>

          <Heading>Klimisch Score</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The Klimisch score system tries to rank the reliability of toxicity studies for use by risk assessors (regulatory agencies). It was published in 1997, by BASF (a chemical company) authors (Klimisch et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1997</CitationRef>). Studies performed according to GLP are assigned the top rank of 1 (reliable without restriction) and are preferred by agencies. When no GLP study is available for a particular end point, a study with a rank of 2 is usually accepted by an agency. Lower ranks typically require a new study to be performed. Klimisch scoring is very widely used in chemical risk assessments. Critics say it is a self-interested bias on objectivity and that a quality system from the regulated party gives their own GLP-complying studies the top rank.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Scientific measurements (whether they pertain to monitoring contaminants in pharmaceutical products, clinical determinations of blood sugar, characterisation of forensic evidence or testing materials for space missions) are generally recognised as affecting decisions literally concerned with life and death issues. As personal acknowledgement of their responsibility, scientists have traditionally adopted sound laboratory practices directed at assuring the quality of their data. However, until recently these practices were not consistently adopted, enforced or audited. Because of some notorious historic examples where erroneous data have lead to tragic consequences, national and international agencies have developed guidelines directed at various industries (food, agriculture, pharmaceutical, clinical, environmental, etc.) which fall in the general category of good laboratory practices (GLP). Within the USA, federal agencies such as FDA and EPA have produced documents defining laboratory operational requirements which must be met so that technical data from laboratory studies may be acceptable by those agencies for any legal or contractual purposes. Laboratories doing business with or for these agencies must therefore comply with the specified GLP regulations. So crucial has the issue of maintaining compliance become that many industries report no less than 10%, and occasionally as much as 50%, of their total effort is expanded on internal quality assurance. A typical level of effort is 25%. Since the issue of GLP is very crucial to modern laboratory operations, but most importantly because good laboratory practice is an essential ingredient for any professional scientist, this course will incorporate many of the principles that are part of GLP in contemporary laboratories.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">SOPs are what the name implies, procedures which have been tested and approved for conducting a particular determination. Often, these procedures are evaluated and published by the regulatory agency involved (e.g. EPA or FDA); these agencies may not accept analytical data obtained by other procedures for particular analytes. Within any commercial laboratory, SOPs should either be available or developed to acceptable standards, so that any analytical data collected and reported can be tied to a documented procedure. Presumably, this implies that a given determination can be repeated at any later time, for an identical specimen, using the SOP indicated.</Para>

Thus, practitioners in a particular field (e.g. agricultural chemistry, clinical chemistry) may adopt certain standards which are deemed acceptable within that field (e.g. using 95 or 99% confidence levels for particular tests), or they may adopt specific statistical analysis procedures for defining detection limits, confidence intervals, analyte measurement units, etc. Regulatory agencies often describe acceptable statistical procedures also.</Para>

            <Heading>Instrumentation Validation</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Instrumentation Validation is a process inherently necessary for any analytical laboratory. Data produced by ‘faulty’ instruments may give the appearance of valid data. These events are particularly difficult to detect with modern computer-controlled systems which remove the analyst from the data collection/instrument control functions. Thus, it is essential that some objective procedures be implemented for continuously assessing the validity of instrumental data. These procedures, when executed on a regular basis, will establish the continuing acceptable operation of laboratory instruments within prescribed specifications. Time-related graphical records of the results of these instrument validation procedures are called ‘control charts’. The ‘control limits’ assigned as upper and lower ranges around the expected instrumental output are generally related to some accepted measure of the random error expected for the overall procedure. (Typically the control limits will be set at ±2(standard development)) Quality assurance procedures will require that whenever a instrument’s performance is outside of the ‘control limits’, use of that instrument to provide analytical reports must be discontinued; the cause of the problem must be determined and fixed if possible; and the instrument must be certified to be operating again with control limits before returning to service for determinations leading to reported analytical data.</Para>

            <Heading>Reagent/Materials Certification</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Reagent/Materials Certification is an obvious element of quality assurance. However, GLP guidelines emphasise that certification must follow accepted procedures and must be adequately documented. Moreover, some guidelines will specify that each container for laboratory reagents/materials must be labelled with information related to its certification value, date and expiration time. This policy is meant to assure that reagents used are as specified in the SOPs.</Para>

          <Heading>Certification of Analysts</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Certification of Analysts is a required part of QA. Some acceptable proof of satisfactory training and/or competence with specific laboratory procedures must be established for each analyst. Because the American Chemical Society does not currently have a policy regarding ‘certification’ of chemists or analysts, the requirements for ‘certification’ vary and are usually prescribed by the laboratory in question. These standards would have to be accepted by any agency or client obtaining results from that laboratory. For our student laboratory, the requirement for certification as an analyst is satisfactory completion of the first three laboratory assignments. Execution of these basic procedures will be repeated, if necessary, until satisfactory results are obtained.</Para>

        <Section1 ID="Sec34">
          <Heading>Certification of Laboratory Facilities</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Certification of Laboratory Facilities is normally done by some external agency. For example, an analytical laboratory might be audited by representatives of a federal agency with which they have a contract. An independent laboratory might file documentation with a responsible state or federal agency. The evaluation is concerned with such issues as space (amount, quality and relevance), ventilation, equipment, storage and hygiene. Student chemistry laboratories are generally evaluated by the American Chemical Society, as part of the process of granting approval for the overall chemistry programme presented by the college or university. This latter approval process is not as detailed regarding analytical facilities as the certification processes pursued by agencies concerned specifically with quality assurance.</Para>

        <Section1 ID="Sec35">
          <Heading>Specimen/Sample Tracking</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Specimen/Sample Tracking is an aspect of quality assurance which has received a great deal of attention with the advent of computer-based laboratory information management systems (LIMS). However, whether done by hand with paper files, or by computer with modern barcoding techniques, sample tracking is a crucial part of quality assurance. The terms ‘specimen’ and ‘sample’ are often used interchangeably. However, ‘specimen’ usually refers to an item to be characterised chemically, whereas ‘sample’ usually refers to a finite portion of the specimen which is taken for analysis. When the specimen is homogeneous (such as a stable solution), the sample represents the overall composition of the specimen. However, for heterogeneous specimens (e.g. metal alloys, rock, soil, textiles, foods, polymer composites, vitamin capsules), a sample may not represent the overall composition. Maintaining the distinction in records of analytical results can be crucial to the interpretation of data.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Procedures for assuring adequate specimen/sample tracking will vary among laboratories. The bottom line, however, is that these procedures must maintain the unmistakable connection between a set of analytical data and the specimen and samples from which they were obtained. In addition, the original source of the specimen/sample(s) must be recorded and likewise unmistakably connected with the set of analytical data. Finally, in many cases the ‘chain of custody’ must be specified and validated. This is particularly true for forensic samples (related to criminal prosecution) but can also be essential for many other situations as well. For example, a pharmaceutical company developing a new product may be called upon at some time to defend their interpretation of clinical trial tests. Such defence may require the company to establish that specimens collected during these trials could not have been deliberately tampered. That is, they may have to establish an unbroken chain of custody which would remove all doubt regarding the integrity of specimens submitted to chemical analysis.</Para>
          <Section2 ID="Sec36">
            <Heading>Documentation and Maintenance of Records</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">A central feature of GLP guidelines is the maintenance of records of specimen/sample origin, chain of custody, raw analytical data, processed analytical data, SOPs, instrument validation results, reagent certification results, analyst certification documents, etc. Maintenance of instrument and reagent certification records provides for post-evaluation of results, even after the passage of several years. Maintenance of all records specified provides documentation which may be required in the event of legal challenges due to repercussions of decisions based on the original analytical results. So important is this record-keeping feature of GLP that many vendors are now providing many of these capabilities as part of computer packages for operating modern instruments. For example, many modern computer-based instruments will provide for the indefinite storage of raw analytical data for specific samples in a protected (tamper-proof) environment. They also provide for maintenance of historical records of control chart data establishing the operational quality of instruments during any period during which analytical data have been acquired by that instrument. The length of time over which laboratory records should be maintained will vary with the situation. However, the general guideline followed in regulated laboratories is to maintain records for at least 5 years. In practice, these records are being maintained much longer. The development of higher-density storage devices for digitised data is making this kind of record-keeping possible. The increasing frequency of litigation regarding chemistry-related commercial products is making this kind of record-keeping essential. Moreover, establishing the integrity of the stored data is becoming a high-level security issue for companies concerned about future litigation. All of the ingredients of record-keeping described above are captured in the scientists’ traditional maintenance laboratory notebook.</Para>

            <Heading>Accountability</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">GLP procedures inherently establish accountability for laboratory results. Analysts, instruments, reagents and analytical methods cannot (and should not) maintain the anonymity that might be associated with a lack of GLP policy. Responsibility for all aspects of the laboratory processes leading to technical results and conclusions is clearly defined and documented. This situation should place appropriate pressure on analysts to conduct studies with adequate care and concern. Moreover, it allows the possibility of identifying more quickly and succinctly the source(s) of error(s) and taking corrective action to maintain acceptable quality of laboratory data.</Para>

Good laboratory practice (GLP) requirements, based on these fundamental scientific principles and practices, are indispensable for providing scientific confidence in studies conducted for chemical safety determinations. These reasons explain why government agencies worldwide require GLP compliance, and why it is entirely appropriate for greater weight to be given to GLP studies than non-GLP studies that are only available as articles in scientific journals. Noncompliance with GLP should not be used as the sole criterion for excluding studies from consideration in regulatory decision-making. GLP should not be the sole criterion, mischaracterisation of the purpose and function of GLP that GLP has no utility for weighting the reliability of studies.</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">Academic basic research is very different from regulatory research and testing. Academic research focuses on developing and evaluating new hypotheses, on creating novel methods and on discovering new findings. Academic research is open to wide interpretation and may require significant additional studies to clarify and determine whether and how broadly the results apply. Although novel techniques and discoveries of academic investigations stimulate further research, they must also stand up to the scientific method: hypothesis formulation, hypothesis testing and validation by independent replication. Independent replication provides critical information on the strength of the hypothesis and reliability of test methods. Inconsistent results can arise from use of novel techniques, different test systems, uncertainty and differences in test chemical composition and purity and a myriad of other factors. These facts, in conjunction with the more limited availability of actual data in most journal publications, mean regulatory agencies can face significant challenges in confirming the quality, performance or data integrity of results obtained solely from information available from a typical article in peer-reviewed journals. Whereas all study records and data from GLP investigations are available to agencies, rarely, if ever, are such details made available as part of the peer-review process for publishing a manuscript in a scientific journal. This can limit the ability of an agency to independently evaluate conclusions or to conduct alternative analyses of the data. The challenges faced by the peer-review procedures of journals have been recently highlighted, and it has been pointed out that ‘…scientists understand that peer review per se provides only a minimal assurance of quality, and that the public conception of peer review as a stamp of authentication is far from the truth’. Journal peer review relies on summarisation of experimental procedures and results and does not include examination of laboratory study records or raw data. The purpose for journal peer review is to judge whether the study has been conducted and reported according to internationally recognised, general scientific standards and whether the study meets the interest level for dissemination to scientific community. It is not designed to provide assurance of accuracy or to recalculate raw data, and it does not provide an opportunity for independent audit of study.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Relevant internationally agreed test methods are used by industry to generate toxicity data for safety determinations by regulatory agencies. Incorporation of GLP in these laboratory tests assures that written protocols and standard operating procedures for each study component are developed carefully and completely followed. GLP also requires meticulous adherence to dosing techniques; the use of adequate group sizes to allow meaningful statistical analysis; characterisation (identity, purity, concentration) of test and control substances, including dosing solutions; detailed recording of study measurements and data; and collection of all raw laboratory data in a manner that can be retained and made available for regulatory agencies to audit and reach independent conclusions. Quality control procedures, quality assurance reviews and facility inspections are also used to monitor and enforce GLP compliance. The relevance, reliability, sensitivity and specificity of most test methods required by industry and regulatory agencies are well understood because they have been subjected to extensive, round-robin validation programmes conducted in numerous laboratories throughout the world. This high level scientific rigour, in conjunction with the detailed processes of GLP, provides regulatory agencies increased confidence in both the relevance and quality of GLP scientific studies for safety decisions, and it is this reason it is wholly appropriate in regulatory decision-making for greater weight and confidence to be afforded to studies conducted in accordance with GLP.</Para>

International harmonisation will minimise the need to perform separate studies for regulatory authorities of different countries.

Animal welfare will benefit because fewer animals will be needed by eliminating repetition of similar studies in each region. This guideline has been developed under the principle of VICH and will provide a unified standard for government regulatory bodies to facilitate the mutual acceptance of TAS data by the relevant authorities.

This document does not cover TAS studies conducted as part of post-approval batch release requirements. Products for use in minor species or minor uses may be exempted from this requirement for local registration. The guideline will not provide information for the design of TAS studies in other species including aquatic animals. For other species, TAS studies should be designed following national or regional guidance. Additional requirements may apply to genetically engineered products according to the region in which authorisation is sought. Immune modulators are not considered in this guideline. During development, animal safety shall be evaluated in the target animal. The purpose of the evaluation is to determine the safety of the dose of the vaccine proposed for registration. The guideline is therefore limited to the health and welfare of the target animals. It does not include evaluation of food safety or environmental safety including impact on human health.</Para>

All studies may not be needed. Additional studies not specified in this document and necessary to investigate specific safety concerns of the vaccine in the target animal may be necessary for certain IVVs. Therefore, specific additional information not specified in this document may be determined by communication between the sponsor and the regulatory authority.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Where studies performed by a sponsor differ from those specified in this document, the sponsor may conduct a literature search and combine these findings with the results of any preliminary experiments to justify any alternative TAS study designs. Essential parameters to be evaluated for the safety of a vaccine are local and systemic reactions to vaccination, including application site reactions and their resolution and clinical observation of the animals. The reproductive effects of the vaccine shall be evaluated where applicable. Special tests may be required, such as haematology, blood chemistry, necropsy or histological examination. Where these tests are conducted in a subset of animals, these animals should be randomly selected with adequate sampling rate before study initiation to avoid bias, unless otherwise justified. In case of unexpected reactions or results, samples should be selected appropriately in order to identify the cause of the problem observed, if possible. Whenever possible, the personnel collecting data in the studies should be masked (blinded) to treatment identification to minimise bias. Pathologists are not required to be masked to the type of IVV and the possible clinical effects should be masked to the treatment groups. Histopathology data should be evaluated by recognised procedures.</Para>

          <Heading>Statistical Analysis</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In laboratory studies, the safety implications are best addressed by applying descriptive statistical methods to the data. Tables and descriptive text are common methods of data summarisation; however, it may also be valuable to make use of graphical presentations in which patterns of adverse events are displayed both within treatments and within individual animals. In field studies, if applicable, selection of the general form for a statistical model and the factors to be included in the model will depend on the nature of the response variable being analysed and the study design. Regardless of the methods chosen, the process and steps used to conduct any statistical evaluations should be described. The outcomes of the data analysis should be clearly presented to facilitate evaluation of potential safety concerns. The terminology and methods of presentation should be chosen to clarify the results and expedite interpretation.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Although there may be interest in the null hypothesis of no difference between treatment study design constraints limit the statistical power and discriminatory ability of these studies. Under these conditions, statistical analysis alone may not detect potential adverse effects and thus provide assurance of safety. A statistically significant test does not necessarily indicate the presence of a safety concern. Similarly, a nonsignificant test does not necessarily indicate the absence of a safety concern. Results should therefore be evaluated based on statistical principles but interpretation should be subject to veterinary medical considerations.</Para>

            <Heading>Guidelines</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Target animal safety for IVV is determined using laboratory and field studies. For both live and inactivated vaccines, any data collected which could be related to the safety of IVV should be reported from studies conducted during development phase of the IVV. These data may be utilised to support TAS laboratory study design and to identify critical parameters to be examined. Laboratory safety studies are designed to be the first step in evaluating target animal safety and provide basic information before initiating the field studies. The design of laboratory safety studies will vary with the type of product and intended use of the product being tested.</Para>

              <Heading>Overdose Test for Live Vaccines</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">For live vaccines shown to retain residual pathogenicity by induction of disease-specific signs or lesions, overdose testing of the live vaccine component should be conducted as part of the risk analyses for the acceptability of the microorganism as vaccine strain. The study should be conducted using either a pilot or production batch. A 10X dose based on the maximum release titre for which the application is submitted shall be administered. In the case where the maximum release titre to be licensed is not specified, the study should be conducted with a justifiable multiple of the minimum release titre, taking into account the need to ensure an appropriate safety margin. Exceptions need to be scientifically justified. Generally, eight animals per group should be used unless otherwise justified. If adjuvant or other components are contained in a diluent for the live vaccine, the amount and concentration in a dose administered should be as proposed and justified in the draft registration dossier. If a 10X titre of antigen cannot be dissolved in 1X dose volume, then a double dose or other minimum volume of diluents that are sufficient to achieve dissolution should be used. The inoculum may be administered using multiple injection sites if justified by the required dose volume or the target species.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Generally, for each target species, the most sensitive class, age and sex proposed on the label should be used. Seronegative animals should be used. In cases where seronegative animals are not reasonably available, alternatives should be justified. If multiple routes and methods of administration are specified for the product concerned, administration by all routes is recommended. If one route of administration has been shown to cause the most severe effects, this single route may be selected as the only one for use in the study. Where applicable, the titre or potency of the batches used for safety testing, particularly the overdose studies, will form the basis for establishing the maximum release titre or potency for batch release.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">For vaccines that require a single lifetime dose or primary vaccination series only, the primary vaccination regimen should be used. For vaccines that require a single dose or primary vaccination series followed by booster vaccination, the primary vaccination regimen plus an additional dose should be used. For convenience, the recommended intervals between administration may be shortened to an interval of at least 14 days. Evaluation of the one/repeat dose testing should be conducted using either a pilot or production batch of IVV containing the maximum release potency; in the case where maximum release potency to be licensed is not specified, then a justified multiple of the minimum release potency should be used. Generally, eight animals per group should be used unless otherwise justified. Generally, for each target species, the most sensitive class, age and sex proposed on the label should be used. Seronegative animals should be used for live vaccines. In cases where seronegative animals are not reasonably available, alternatives should be justified.

In addition, other relevant criteria such as rectal temperature (for mammals) or performance measurement are recorded within this observation period with appropriate frequency. All observations should be recorded for the entire period. Injection sites should be examined daily or at other justified intervals by inspection and palpation for a minimum of 14 days after each administration of the IVV. When at the injection site adverse reactions are present (at the end of the 14-day observation), the observation period should be extended until clinically acceptable resolution of the lesion has occurred or, if appropriate, until the animal is euthanised and histopathological examination is performed.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Examinations of reproductive performance of breeding animals must be considered when data suggest that the starting material from which the product is derived may be a risk factor. The laboratory studies in concert with the field safety studies are required to support use in breeding animals. If the reproductive safety studies are not performed, an exclusion statement must be included on the label, unless a scientific justification for absence of risk for use of the IVV in the breeding animal is provided. The design and extent of the laboratory and field safety studies will be based upon the type of organism(s) involved, the type of vaccine, timing and route of delivery and the animal species involved.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">For examination of reproductive safety, animals appropriate for the purpose of the study will be vaccinated with at least the recommended dose according to the vaccination scheme indicated. If multiple routes and methods of administration are specified for the product concerned, administration by all routes is recommended. If one route of administration has been shown to cause the most severe effects, this single route may be selected as the only one for use in the study. Generally, 8 animals per group should be used unless otherwise justified using either a pilot or production batch. The animals should be observed for a period appropriate to determine reproductive safety, including daily safety observations. Exceptions should be justified. A control group should be included.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Vaccines recommended for use in pregnant animals must be tested as described above in each of the specific periods of gestation recommended for use in the label. An exclusion statement will be required for those gestation periods not tested. The observation period must be extended to parturition, to examine any harmful effects during gestation or on progeny. Exceptions should be justified. When scientifically warranted, additional studies may be required to determine the effect(s) of IVV on semen, including shedding of the live organism in semen. The observation period should be appropriate for the purpose of the study. For IVVs recommended for use in future layers or laying hens, study design should include evaluation of parameters that are appropriate for the class of hens vaccinated.</Para>

It is the responsibility of the sponsor to ensure that field studies should be conducted under animal husbandry conditions representative of those regions in which authorisation is sought. Local authorisations must be obtained prior to conduction of the study. Consultation with regional regulatory authorities regarding study design prior to conduction of the studies is recommended.

            <Heading>Data Collection</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Observations should be made over a period of time appropriate for the IVV and adverse events should be documented and included in the final report. Reasonable attempts should be made to determine causality for the adverse event. Submission of target animal safety (TAS) data is a requirement for the registration or licensure of veterinary live and inactivated vaccines in the regions participating in the VICH. International harmonisation will minimise the need to perform separate studies for regulatory authorities of different countries. Appropriate international standards will reduce research and development costs by avoiding, when possible, duplication of TAS studies. Animal welfare will benefit because fewer animals will be needed by eliminating repetition of similar studies in each region.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">This guideline has been developed under the principle of VICH and will provide a unified standard for government regulatory bodies to facilitate the mutual acceptance of TAS data by the relevant authorities. The use of this VICH guideline to support registration of a product for local distribution only is strongly encouraged but is up to the discretion of the local regulatory authority. Furthermore, it is not always necessary to follow this guideline when there are scientifically justifiable reasons for using alternative approaches.</Para>
