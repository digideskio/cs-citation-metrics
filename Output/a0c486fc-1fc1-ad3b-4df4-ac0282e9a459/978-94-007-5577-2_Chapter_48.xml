              <Para>We conducted a study of ozone formation in the Lower Fraser Valley (LFV), using WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ models, observations and emission inventories in order to understand relationships between the reduction in both amount and location of precursor emissions and spatio-temporal changes in episodic ambient ozone concentrations over the last 20 years. A dynamical model evaluation shows that the modeling framework is able to capture the changes in both magnitude and spatio-temporal structure of ozone concentrations over the 20-year period. We model ozone formation for four episodes, which both capture the observed changes in ozone reduction and the different meteorological regimes that occur during LFV ozone episodes. The SMOKE emission inventories are adjusted to account for temporal changes in amount, and location of emissions, based on population shifts. Model runs allow us to isolate the effects of emission changes from meteorological changes. Results show that the western LFV has been, and remains VOC-sensitive; the central LFV has changed from VOC-limited to NOx-limited; and the eastern LFV has been, and remains NOx-limited. Analysis shows that the ozone production efficiency as a function of NO has increased noticeably in the eastern LFV. This has likely offset some of the benefits resulting from local NOx emission reductions.</Para>

Local air quality management strategies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00483">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00484">4</CitationRef>] implemented over the past 20 years have reduced total emissions of ozone precursors in the valley, while the spatial distribution of population (and hence ozone precursors) has shifted markedly. There has been a marked eastward shift in the ozone plume over the same period The objective of this research is to use the WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ modeling system to explore emissions ambient relations in the LFV and to elucidate whether spatial shifts in the ozone “plume” arise from changes in amount, reactivity or spatial location (or all three) of emissions.</Para>

              <Para>The SMOKE-generated emissions inventory was adjusted to account for changes in both amount of emissions and the location of emission sources, with separate emission inventories for: light and heavy duty vehicles (through the MOBILE 6.2 and MOBILE 6.2C), off-road vehicles, railroads, aircraft, marine, other mobile sources, biogenic emissions, point sources, and area sources. Total annual emission rates of NOx, VOCs, CO, SO2, PM10, PM25, and NH3 within the LFV for each of the source categories, were taken from the Metro Vancouver forecast and backcast emission inventories [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00484">4</CitationRef>]. Biogenic emissions were modelled the MEGAN modelling framework. The spatial distribution of emissions was achieved using 38 different spatial surrogates, gridded to 36, 12 and 4-km domains. The 4-km surrogates were dynamically adjusted, by changes in local population density.</Para>
              <Para>The Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF V 3.1) employing three two-way nested domains with grid cell resolutions of 36, 12 and 4 km at 48 vertical eta-levels was used to produce high-resolution meteorological fields. Each 96 h WRF run was initialized at 1800Z using North American Regional Re-analysis fields at a 32-km resolution. Nudging was used in outer domains to the analysis fields outside of the boundary layer.</Para>
              <Para>The EPA Models-3 CMAQ modelling system version 4.7.1 was used for the photochemical modelling. Allowing for a 12-h spin up-period in the 96-h runs provided in excess of three full days of modelling for each episode. Background ozone, CO, and NOx were obtained from RETRO monthly average output fields created from the ECHAM5-MOZ coupled GCM/chemical and aerosol model. The carbon bond version 5 (CB05) gas phase chemical mechanism with chlorine using the AE-5 aerosol module was used.</Para>

              <Heading>Model Evaluation</Heading>
              <Para>Detailed evaluation was applied to meteorological and chemical fields over four episodes, spanning the analysis period: July 1985, July 1995, August 2001 &amp; June 2006. Particular attention was paid to the ability of the modeling system to respond to spatio-temporal ozone field changes over the analysis period. The episodes modeled included all four meso-meteorological types associated with ozone episodes in the LFV [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00481">1</CitationRef>]. WRF performance was evaluated against a wide range of meteorological data from fixed stations, tethered balloon, lidar and aircraft data. CMAQ performance was evaluated against routine and special study data, chemical canister and balloon borne measurements of a wide range of modeled chemicals.</Para>
              <Para>Based on this model evaluation, we conclude that the WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ modelling system produces ozone fields over the 20-year study period that are responsive to the estimated changes in local precursor emissions and are in generally good agreement with observations from the monitoring network. Some episodes show better comparisons with observations than others. This is in part due to weaknesses in the meteorological modelling. The model shows a changing bias over time, which might be related to uncertainties in the emissions backcasting.</Para>
              <Para>Using model evaluation approaches outlined in Galmarini et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00482">2</CitationRef>] and especially the idea that a model is validated if it is judged to be “fit for purpose”, we conclude that, while the model output does not exactly match all details of observed meteorological and chemical fields it is responsive to the changes in emissions between 1985 and 2005. Furthermore, the magnitude of the response is comparable to observed changes in the ozone plume. We therefore conclude that the modelling system is indeed fit for the intended purpose and that we can proceed to investigate the causes underlying observed spatio-temporal shifts in ozone fields in the LFV.</Para>

              <Para>The western LFV has been and remains VOC-sensitive. Large VOC emission reductions, stemming from light duty vehicles and petroleum refining emission controls, have been effective in reducing ozone concentrations in the western LFV. Some benefits of the VOC emissions reductions have been offset by the simultaneous NOx emission reductions that have occurred in and around the Vancouver urbanized area. Nonetheless, these precursor emissions reductions have led to decreasing 1- and 8-h episodic ozone concentrations.</Para>
              <Para>The mid-valley region has gone from being VOC-limited to NOx-limited over the 20-year period; however, given the variability due to meteorology, it is probably better to characterize it as showing mixed sensitivity. VOC reductions (largely from VOC emission reductions in light duty vehicle; petroleum refining emissions not being greatly influential here) along with NOx emission reductions, appear to have offset one another in this part of the LFV. Ozone production efficiency as a function of NO has increased noticeably in this part of the valley. This efficiency increase has likely offset some of the benefits resulting from NOx emission reductions. The change in ozone sensitivity and the increased ozone production efficiency have changed the shape of the diurnal ozone profile to one that is less peaked around the daily maximum. As a result of this broadening, for a fixed peak ozone level, 8-h averaged concentrations calculated around the peak concentration have increased. An eastward shift in population from 1985 to 2005 have likely had a greater affect at mid-valley than in the western part of the valley. The net effect of these changes is consistent with the modest decline in peak 1-h ozone concentrations with the weakly declines in 8-h averaged concentrations.</Para>

                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: Did you account for land use changes, especially in terms of vegetation and the impact of biogenic emission changes?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: We adjusted the emissions spatial allocation factors dynamically through the 20-year period based on changes in population per grid square. This changed the proportion of vegetated surface in each grid square, and therefore the biogenic emission. We did not change the vegetation type with time.</SimplePara>

              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: What about the transport of pollutants into the valley from remote sources? Could that affect the shift of ozone regimes?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: We performed extensive back trajectory analyses to show that the LFV really is an isolated region. Emissions from Seattle (the nearest source region of any note) simply do not get to the LFV during ozone episodes.</SimplePara>

              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: What caused the ozone production efficiency to increase from 1985 to 2005?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: As in other regions where this has been noted, it is driven by the NOx/VOC ratio and to a certain extent by the VOC composition.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Questioner Name</Emphasis>: Jeff Weil</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: (1) Was the main source of NOx &amp; VOC light duty vehicles? If so, how was the factor of 2 reduction achieved?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: Yes, LDV has always been the main emissions source in the LFV. The reduction has been achieved by a sequence of AQ management plans over the past 20 years. Mostly the reduction has been thanks to an aggressive emissions monitoring program linked to vehicle insurance and registration. Of course this has been facilitated by improvements in engine efficiency and emissions controls.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: (2) Is valley meteorology, particularly slope and valley flows important in ozone formation?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: Allow me to defer answering this until the next paper (by Annie Seagram), which demonstrates the crucial importance of such flows.</SimplePara>
