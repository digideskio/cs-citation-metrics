              <Para TextBreak="No">Many employees suffer from emotional issues, family and home life conflicts, mental health ­concerns, substance abuse problems, and other health disorders that can interfere with doing their work effectively. The nature of work itself can also sometimes contribute to employee performance problems. In addition, societal changes and community problems (such as natural disasters, violence, economic distress) can influence employee health and behavior. Whether the source is from the individual, the workplace itself or greater society, many employers have turned to employee assistance programs (EAPs) to help respond to these kinds of problems. This chapter addresses the topic of EAPs, and their role in occupational health and wellness. It is organized into three main parts. The first part presents an overview of the EAP. The middle part reviews the research evidence for EAPs. The final part describes major trends in the field of EAP. Global expansion is also examined as a future direction for EAPs.</Para>

              <Heading>Overview of EAP</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Before examining the evidence for EAPs and the current trends in the field, it is necessary to first understand the nature of EAPs. Thus, this part of the chapter provides an overview of EAP (Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002116">2009a</CitationRef>). It includes a brief history of the field, the primary activities of an EAP, the unique qualities that distinguish an EAP, the contemporary business models and major market types, the promotion and use of EAPs, and the professional standards that guide the industry.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00213">
                <Heading>Definition of EAP</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">EAPs are defined as employer- or group-supported programs designed to alleviate employee issues (Employee Assistance Society of North America [EASNA], 2009). Most employees use EAP services on a voluntary basis through self-referrals. Most often, the EAP is used for assistance with mild to moderate problems that cause acute stress (e.g., family/marital relationship issues, work problems, and legal or financial concerns), rather than for the treatment of more serious mental health and ­substance abuse disorders. The goal of these programs is to have a positive effect on restoring the health and well-being of the employee which, in turn, results in a return to higher productivity and improves overall organizational performance. Modern EAPs are complex programs that often feature interaction with work/life and other behavioral health services to address a host of mental health and, substance abuse issues, as well as workplace performance problems among employees and their family members. EAPs can reach employees through a combination of different channels, including face-to-face visits with counselors, 24/7 telephone calls, Internet resources, and onsite workplace events. Several kinds of operating models are available for EAPs—those that involve staff who work as employees of the same organization where they provide EAP services, programs that rely on external staff who work for a different company (a vendor of EAP services), and a combination of internally staffed services and externally provided resources.</Para>

                <Heading>Brief History of EAP</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">EAP services initially arose out of a need for a stable and skilled workforce during World War II. During the 1940s, companies in the United States figured that it might be more cost-effective to rehabilitate problem drinkers than to have a “revolving door” employment policy of repeatedly hiring and firing impaired workers (Trice &amp; Schonbrunn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021162">1981</CitationRef>). Thus, these early EAPs focused largely on alcohol issues of employees by providing outreach to, identification of, and early intervention for employees struggling with alcohol-related problems. This approach led to the emergence of Occupational Alcoholism Programs. These workplace-based programs grew in acceptance and number throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Since then, the EAP field has grown significantly and now addresses employee health and behavioral health problems, as well as work/life challenges in addition to retaining a specialization of supporting employees with addiction problems. In recognition of this wider scope of services, most EAPs are considered “broad-brush” programs that are designed to support multiple kinds of employee, family and workforce performance issues.</Para>

                <Heading>EAP Industry Today</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Today, EAP services are benefits offered by tens of thousands of employers and used by millions of employees in North America and across the globe.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">EAP in the United States</Emphasis>. As the birthplace of the EAP, the United States has the greatest coverage of EAP services. The majority of large employers provide EAP benefits to their employees and often their family members too (Mercer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021120">2008</CitationRef>). According to a national benefits survey of private sector companies conducted in 2008, EAPs are provided by 89% of large employers (500+ staff), 76% of medium employers (100–499 staff) and 52% of small employers (1–99 staff) (Society for Human Resources Management, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021155">2009</CitationRef>). As it is a challenge to directly serve smaller employers, collectives representing many small businesses in certain geographic locations, or through trade group associations, can now purchase EAPs.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">EAP in Canada</Emphasis>. Similar to the United States, EAPs have become the primary channel for many Canadian workers to get their first access to mental health care and addiction treatment services. In Canada, these programs are called EFAPs—Employee and Family Assistance Programs—and are particularly popular in unionized environments, and medium to larger size organizations (Csiernik, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002157">2002</CitationRef>). A national survey found that EFAPs were present in 68% of Canadian employers with at least 100 employees (Macdonald, Csiernik, Durand, Rylett &amp; Wild, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021103">2006</CitationRef>). Although similar in most regards, EFAPs in Canada tend to emphasize services to the organization (see next section) more so than programs in the United States, and to also provide more extensive clinical counseling services to individuals.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">EAP in Europe</Emphasis>. Survey data from 2007 indicates that approximately 10% of organizations in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, and Denmark have EAP services (Buon &amp; Taylor, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002145">2007</CitationRef>). Anecdotal evidences notes that the present day rates of EAP service offerings in this region are now somewhat higher (Athanasiades, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00215">2011</CitationRef>). EAP services in Europe are delivered mostly by external EAP providers who offer a broad array of counseling and other services designed to help employees with personal and work problems (Grange, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002181">2005</CitationRef>). As with EAPs in North America, an important focus of the EAPs in the UK is maintaining and improving workplace effectiveness and performance.</Para>

              <Section2 ID="Sec00216">
                <Heading>EAP Services</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">EAPs differ greatly in the level of workplace support, the degree of program integration, and the range of services provided to the organization, management, union and employees. However, there are five kinds of activities that are performed to varying degrees by all EAPs (see Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00211">21.1</InternalRef>). These primary activities include: (1) Services for individuals; (2) Services for managers and supervisors; (3) Services for the organization; (4) Liaison services to support other programs and services; and (5) Administrative services for the sponsor/purchaser. Arguably, the most essential function of a successful EAP is its ability to provide confidential counseling services, free of charge, when it is needed on a 24/7 basis to employees, management and their family members. A recent survey of EAP professionals in the United States found that this aspect of EAP services was ranked first in its importance to defining “what an EAP should be” (Attridge &amp; Burke, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002125">2011</CitationRef>). Similarly, a recent survey of human resources professionals in Europe found that various kinds of individual counseling were the kinds of services they wanted most to be provided by the EA programs at their organizations (Buon &amp; Taylor, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002145">2007</CitationRef>).<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00211">

                <Para TextBreak="No">Having quick and easy access to professionally trained and licensed counselors from an EAP is a very important benefit to organizations, as mental health and substance abuse disorders are among the most common and most costly problems affecting the workplace and yet they are profoundly under-treated. According to national epidemiologic surveys in the United States, about 1 in 4 people each year in the general population have symptoms that meet clinical criteria for having mental and substance use disorders, and yet two-thirds of them do not receive any treatment at all for their condition (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas &amp; Walters, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002195">2005</CitationRef>; Wang et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021165">2005</CitationRef>). Similarly high prevalence rates for mental health and addiction disorders and lack of treatment are found throughout the world (World Health Organization, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021168">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">To appreciate the “assess and refer” role of EAPs, consider that on a covered population basis, roughly 10% of all employees in the United States have claims each year for use of some form of outpatient or inpatient mental health or substance abuse treatment services (Dentzer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002164">2009</CitationRef>). However, most of these outpatient “treatments” are delivered by primary care doctors and tend to feature a medication only approach. For example, in the United States in year 2007, of the patients who used outpatient mental health care services, 57% received only medications, 32% received both medications and psychotherapy, and only 11% received psychotherapy alone (Olfson &amp; Marcus, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021126">2010</CitationRef>). Based upon the thousands of studies supporting the clinical effectiveness of psychotherapy (Lipsey &amp; Wilson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021102">1993</CitationRef>), a superior response would be for more primary care doctors to encourage the use of mental health professionals who can provide effective “talk therapy” types of treatments. And, yet, this is precisely what EAPs do every day, when an EAP counselor makes a referral to outpatient counseling benefits for the 10–25% of clients who have issues serious enough to merit further treatment.</Para>

                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Work Focus</Emphasis>. The primary reason for an organization to purchase an EAP service is to improve the at-work performance of their employees. This focus on restoration of work function is important because personal and work problems can impair an individual’s ability to carry out their work ­effectively and efficiently (Grange, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002181">2005</CitationRef>). EAP counselors are expert at the identification of employees’ behavioral problems, and it includes assessment of job performance issues (tardiness, absence, productivity, work relationships, safety, etc.). Consequently, the EAP service should be judged primarily on the basis of the success of the service to positively influence client improvement in job performance. As seen later in this chapter in the section on outcomes, EAPs often have positive results in the area of improving employee work performance.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Manager Training</Emphasis>. For the EAP to be successful, the program must be understood by key employees at the organization. Given the important role of supervisors and managers in noticing problems among their staff and making an informal or formal (for cause) referral to the EAP counselor for assistance, another core technology component is the provision of expert consultation to supervisors, managers and union stewards on how to use EAP policy and procedures for both employee problems and for management issues.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Linkages and Referral</Emphasis>. The EAP should know the range of resources available to assist employees from within the company (called micro-linkages) and also from the surrounding local communities as well (called macro linkages). The EAP should be able to offer direction to troubled employees for what to learn about, where to go and what to do in order to improve their situation. Offering this kind of information that is tailored to the individual’s problem and local environment is empowering and spurs the feelings of confidence and self-efficacy that is needed to effectively respond to the situation and to make behavioral lifestyle changes. Most EAPs use a thorough initial assessment process, and maintain a database of current and accurate resources appropriate for referral to fulfill this core component.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Alcohol and Drug Abuse</Emphasis>. Harking back to its early roots, EAPs have always had a substance abuse and addiction focus. The workplace offers a useful context for the identification and referral for individuals with drinking and drug abuse problems (Roman &amp; Blum, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021144">2002</CitationRef>). Most EAPs provide confidential services to management and workers with substance abuse and misuse problems. A 2003 survey of over 800 professionals in the EAP field (Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002110">2003a</CitationRef>) found that 89% of EA programs offered alcohol or drug screenings. Another finding from this survey was that 92% of the alcohol and drug cases identified were employees of the organizations they supported, compared to only 8% who were nonemployees. Of these employees with alcohol or drug issues, about two-thirds were self-referrals, with the remaining one-third referred to the EAP by their supervisors due to performance or safety problems.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">While almost all EAPs offer alcohol and drug screenings and referral, the higher-quality EAPs also have staff specifically trained and certified in providing clinical assessments and case management for people with substance abuse problems (Malain, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021109">2010</CitationRef>). For example, in the 2003 survey, about half of EAPs (54%) offered EAP Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) services. As a result of the expertise of the SAP specialists (over half in the study had 15 years or more experience), and the required use of long-term follow-up services, the vast majority of clients (89%) working with SAP specialists from EAPs went on to complete substance abuse treatment. Although used infrequently today, the appropriate use of constructive confrontation techniques by EAP counselors can lead some employees to get past their denial and agree to enter treatment for their alcohol or substance abuse problems.</Para>

                <Heading>Contemporary EAP Business Models and Markets</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">While the types of services offered through the EAP may vary in breadth from organization to ­organization, they are typically delivered through one of three basic staffing models. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">internal model</Emphasis> is defined by EAP staff who are employees of the organization. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">external model</Emphasis> is when the sponsoring company or organization has entered into a contract for EAP services with an outside vendor. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">blended or hybrid model</Emphasis> shares elements of both of the other models, and it usually has a full-time EAP staff resident at the host organization, and also has external contract personnel involved in the delivery of EAP services (such as a network of affiliate counselors, specialist for crisis event support, and so on). These EAPs operate in a range of market contexts that reflect these different delivery models. Seven markets for EAP business have been identified based on model, organizational context and size (Amaral, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00213">2010</CitationRef>). These market types include internal programs for private sector organizations, internal programs for public sector organizations, internal programs for universities and colleges, internal programs for unions and other member-based groups, external programs serving national and/or international markets, external programs serving specific regions or smaller markets, and hybrid programs resident in one organization but also selling EA services to other local organizations (these are often in hospital or health care systems). According to a recent industry report (Open Minds, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021127">2011</CitationRef>), significant consolidation exists at the provider level in the United States, with three-fourths of the total market for external EAP services being controlled by only 10 firms.</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00219">
                <Heading>EAP Promotion and Use</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">According to industry norms, the number of employee and family members who use EAP counseling services in a year for clinical support represents about 3–5% of the total number of all covered employees (Amaral, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00212">2008</CitationRef>; EASNA, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002170">2009</CitationRef>). When one also includes use of the nonclinical kinds of services, then the overall EAP usage rate is higher (often doubled). However, this metric depends on how the EAP counts the many services they provide—such as clinical counseling services, management consultations, organizational services, crisis support services, information and referral ­assistance, education/training, and other services it provides. Even so, this level of EAP service utilization is relatively small when compared against the 100% of an employee population (and their family members) that has access to potentially using the service. However, a more realistic usage target may be the segment of the working population each year who have some form of mental health and/or addiction problem that interferes with their ability to function properly at work or home. A recent national survey in Canada found that 12% of employees met this definition as having a mental health issue in the past year (Thorpe &amp; Chenier, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021161">2011</CitationRef>)</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In practice, EAP utilization varies widely from company to company. It is determined largely by how it is set up and promoted. At the high end is the full-service traditional EAP that is staffed with a core group of EAP professionals (likely with Certified Employee Assistance Professional (CEAP) ­status) who are employees within the organization it serves. These kinds of programs tend to have the highest levels of use (in the range of 10–20% rate) due to their high visibility and the ability of EAP personnel to interact frequently on-site with management at the organization to collaborate on workplace health and risk issues. At the other extreme is the external EAP that is given away as a “perk” when the organization purchases a comprehensive health or risk insurance benefit package (the EAP fees are rolled into the total cost and hidden from the purchaser). These so-called free EAP programs are typically under-promoted (if at all) and consequently have very little usage (less than 1%). But this low level of use can be acceptable to the organization when the business goal is limited to providing risk-management coverage by having crisis incident support services on call if needed and to at least “offer” its employees access to a counselor (Burke &amp; Sharar, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002148">2009</CitationRef>). In this regard, the phrase “you get what you pay for” certainly applies to EAP services.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Research has shown higher levels of EAP use when company policy specifically features the EAP (Weiss, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021166">2003</CitationRef>). Indeed, part of an effective implementation process for the EAP involves formalizing the availability and role of the EAP by including it in the written HR practices and policies for the organization and then including it in regular promotional communications to the employees at work and at home (Csiernik, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002159">2003b</CitationRef>). Regular and ongoing promotion of the EAP within the organization is also important because some users of services come to the EAP as referrals given by others in the organization, such as supervisors, union stewards, human resources staff, safety officers, medical personnel, disability case managers, and staff in other areas. Despite frequent communication and promotion for the EAP, stigma and discrimination against people with mental health and addiction problems can dampen EAP use, even though it is convenient and available at no cost. The result is that many employees who could potentially benefit from using the EAP do not because of their fears of discrimination or shame from others where they work (Mood Disorders Society of Canada, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021121">2009</CitationRef>). EAPs have attempted to counter this stigmatization issue through offering services at private clinic office locations away from the worksite, over the telephone and online via the Internet (Butterworth, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002149">2001</CitationRef>). Some EAPs have also folded the entry point into the program under the umbrella of larger and less stigmatized workplace services, such as Work/Life programs or corporate health and wellness departments. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">EY Assist</Emphasis> program at global financial services firm Ernst &amp; Young is an example of this approach (Turner, Weiner &amp; Keegan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021164">2005</CitationRef>). When they combined the EAP, Work/Life and HR/benefits Web sites into one central function, the result was a higher use rate of 25% annually for the combined new program, compared to the 8% for the EAP separately, and 12% for the Work/Life program separately as stand-alone programs the year before.</Para>

                <Heading>EAP Professional Standards</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The EAP industry offers voluntary certification of individual professionals and accreditation of ­provider companies. The Employee Assistance Professional Association (EAPA) is the largest professional organization for EAPs, with over 6,000 members worldwide. It offers the (CEAP) designation. The CEAP is a voluntary credential that identifies individuals as EAP professionals who have met established standards for practice (EAPA, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002168">2010</CitationRef>), and who adhere to the code of ethics (EAPA, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002167">2009</CitationRef>). Over 5,000 individuals have earned the CEAP designation (EAPA, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002166">2006</CitationRef>). It should also be noted that the accreditation process for EA programs was designed to ensure that providers meet specific minimum standards for quality practice and that clinical staff possesses the required qualifications and experience needed in order to provide high quality service (Maiden, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021107">2003</CitationRef>). In partnership with the Council on Accreditation (COA), the Employee Assistance Society of North America first created the accreditation standards in 2001 (Stockert, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021158">2004</CitationRef>). The accreditation process provided by the COA includes a comprehensive self-study program followed by an on-site review conducted by trained and experienced EAP peer reviewers. The COA accreditation standards are now in their eighth edition, and include 12 primary components with over 50 sub-areas. To date, there are 57 EAP programs that have been accredited by COA (Attridge, Tannenbaum, Wolinsky, Slater &amp; Goehner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002128">2009</CitationRef>). Note that this number represents only a small fraction of the more than 1,000 external providers who sell EA services in Canada and the United States (Amaral, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00213">2010</CitationRef>). Finally, those interested in learning more about EAPs are encouraged to get the recently published guide to EAP, called <Emphasis Type="Italic">Selecting and Strengthening Employee Assistance Programs: A Purchaser’s Guide</Emphasis> (EASNA, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002170">2009</CitationRef>).

                <Para TextBreak="No">The EAP field is grounded in a body of empirical and clinical evidence generated from hundreds of studies of individual, group and organizational-level EAP services. There are several research-based books and texts specifically on EAP services (e.g., Attridge, Herlihy &amp; Maiden, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002126">2005</CitationRef>; Masi, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021111">1984</CitationRef>; Oher, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021125">1999</CitationRef>; Richard, Emener &amp; Hutchison, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021137">2009</CitationRef>; Shain &amp; Groeneveld, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021151">1980</CitationRef>; Sonnenstuhl &amp; Trice, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021156">1990</CitationRef>; Wrich, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021169">1980</CitationRef>) and one scholarly journal dedicated to the field of EAP (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Employee Assistance Quarterly</Emphasis>; which changed its name in 2005 to the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Journal of Workplace Behavioral Health: Employee Assistance Practice and Research</Emphasis>). Over the past 25 years, over 500 peer-review articles on EAP have appeared in this journal alone, with the collected works from special issues also published separately as 13 edited books. In addition to this scholarly influence, as an applied industry, technical knowledge about EAP has been developed and shared over the years through participation at regular professional meetings and articles in several trade industry publications. EAPA hosts an annual conference (often drawing over 1,000 attendees) and publishes the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Journal of Employee Assistance</Emphasis>. EASNA also holds an annual institute and its’ members receive the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Journal of Workplace Behavioral Health</Emphasis>.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The applied nature of the service delivery context for EAP being enacted within complex and changing organizations, however, has limited the rigor of research in this area (Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00216">2001a</CitationRef>). The result is that the vast majority of EAP studies have been conducted with nonexperimental research designs (Arthur, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00214">2000</CitationRef>; Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00217">2001b</CitationRef>; Csiernik, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002156">1995</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002160">2005a</CitationRef>). More typical of EA research are studies that use a single-group design based on within-person changes over-time on clinical and work performance indicators, assessed by counselors and other similar outcomes assessed at follow-up from self-report surveys of clients. The quality level of research has waned, though, since major government funding for alcohol-related programs involving EAPs dried up after the heyday years of the 1980s. A chronic lack of funding to support more sophisticated research has led to debates within the field about whether it should be regarded as a true profession (based on open sharing of evidence and research) or an industry driven by commercial interests (Masi, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021112">2011</CitationRef>; Roman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021141">2007</CitationRef>). Of course, to be fair, the field of EAP has elements of both of these identities.</Para>

                <Heading>Historical Themes of EAP Research</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A recent 25-year retrospective analysis was prepared that discerned the most prevalent themes among the 545 articles published during this span in the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Employee Assistance Quarterly/Journal of Workplace Behavioral Health (</Emphasis>Maiden, Kurzman, Amaral, Stephenson &amp; Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021108">2010</CitationRef>). The “Top 10” topics, in order by frequency, are provided in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00213">21.3</InternalRef>. The range of themes is representative of the major issues of how EAPs are established, operated and evaluated. The most common clinical issues during this period included alcohol abuse, drug abuse, psychological/emotional problems, critical incidents/trauma and relationship issues. The global growth of the field is also noted. The topic area of health promotion and health benefits—the one most closely related to the larger theme of this Handbook on occupational health and wellness—is also among the top areas of concern for the field.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00213">

                <Heading>EAP Clinical Effectiveness</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The evidence shows that EAPs are often effective in improving the personal and clinical issues that prompted using the service. A review of over 30 workplace counseling research studies found varying levels of methodological rigor among the investigations, but came to the conclusion that there was consistent evidence for the effectiveness of EAP clinical counseling services (McLeod &amp; McLeod, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021118">2001</CitationRef>). Improvements due to individual level EAP interventions have been measured from counselor assessments conducted at “case open” and “case close” points in time for each client user of the service, and also through self-report surveys of clients after their use of the EAP (Csiernik, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002158">2003a</CitationRef>; Csiernik, Hannah &amp; Pender, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002162">2007</CitationRef>; Dersch, Shumway, Harris &amp; Arredonondo, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002165">2002</CitationRef>; Harris, Adams, Hill, Morgan &amp; Soliz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002187">2002</CitationRef>; Philips, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021129">2004</CitationRef>). For example, results from a follow-up survey of 1,050 clients of an external model telephonic-based EAP service found that 75% of users reported reduced stress, and 73% reported improved health and well-being (Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00218">2001c</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Basic clinical indicators of mental health and well-being, such as the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Global Assessment of Functioning</Emphasis> (GAF; Jacobson, Jones &amp; Bowers, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002192">2011</CitationRef>), are also commonly used in evaluating EAP clinical services. For example, a study by the largest internal EAP in the world (Federal Occupational Health), with data from over 59,000 employees of the US government, found that GAF scores improved over 10% on average from “case open” to “case close” (Selvik &amp; Stephenson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021149">2003</CitationRef>). Other measures of patient functioning have been incorporated with similar success into counselor-based assessments and follow-up surveys (Greenwood, DeWeese &amp; Inscoe, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002182">2005</CitationRef>; Harris et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002187">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Section2 ID="Sec002115">
                <Heading>EAP Outcomes</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Research on the experience of individual users of EAP services has consistently found high ­levels client satisfaction (Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002111">2003b</CitationRef>; Csiernik, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002159">2003b</CitationRef>; Csiernik et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002162">2007</CitationRef>; Dersch et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002165">2002</CitationRef>; Harris et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002187">2002</CitationRef>; McLeod, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021117">2010</CitationRef>; Philips, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021129">2004</CitationRef>). Satisfaction levels are routinely at the 95% level or higher for the percentage of users being satisfied overall with the EAP services (Sealy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021146">2011</CitationRef>; Selvik &amp; Bingaman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021148">1998</CitationRef>; Siddell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021152">2007</CitationRef>). As EAPs serve organizations, it is no surprise that the literature also shows that they have a positive impact on a variety of organizational level outcomes. Numerous studies have found positive effects for crisis incident response services (Attridge &amp; VandePol, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002129">2010</CitationRef>), consultation to managers for workgroup problems (Bidgood, Boudewyn &amp; Fasbinder, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002138">2005</CitationRef>), support for workplace changes like mergers and layoffs (Ginzberg, Kilburg &amp; Gomes, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002175">1999</CitationRef>), and more synergistic support of other employee health programs through integration of services (Csiernik, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002161">2005b</CitationRef>). EAPs also routinely show positive outcomes for employers in areas of job performance, such as reductions in absence days and improvements in work productivity. In his recent review of the literature in this area, McLeod concluded that EAP “counselling has a consistent and significant impact on important dimensions of work behaviour” (2010, p. 245). Given the primacy of this outcome area as the most common value generated from EA services, three examples of workplace improvement for ­individual clients of EAP are presented below:</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Workplace Outcome Study 1</Emphasis>—Workplace performance outcome data were collected from over 26,000 cases during a 9 year period from a large external EAP. The results revealed that the average rating on a 1–10 scale of the level of work productivity had rebounded significantly from 4.8 at before use of the EAP to 8.3 after use of the EAP (Attridge, Otis &amp; Rosenberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002127">2002</CitationRef>). The after EAP use rating of 8.3 is just under to the normative productivity level rating of 8.9 on the same scale that was obtained in a nationally representative sample of employees in the United States who had <Emphasis Type="Italic">not</Emphasis> used an EAP (Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002112">2004</CitationRef>). This study also found that almost half of the cases (48%) reported that they had been able to avoid taking time off from work because of their use of the EAP. The duration of this effect was an average of 1.8 days of absenteeism avoided per case.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Workplace Outcome Study 2</Emphasis>—The EAP for the US government collected counselor-assessed ­ratings of employee productivity and absence over a several year period on over 59,000 EAP clinical cases (Selvik, Stephenson, Plaza &amp; Sugden, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021150">2004</CitationRef>). The results showed that the percentage of employees using the EAP that had difficulty performing their work due to mental health factors was reduced from 30% of all cases to just 8%. There was also a significant reduction in work absenteeism days and tardiness, with absenteeism changing from an average among all EAP cases from 2.4 days to 0.9 days, respectively, for the 30 days before use of the EAP, compared to the 30 days after EAP use concluded.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Workplace Outcome Study 3</Emphasis>—Another study featured the analysis of before and after data obtained from over 3,500 employee users of a national external EAP in the United States (Baker, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002133">2007</CitationRef>). Among the approximately 40% of cases who had work performance problems before the use of the EAP, the average number of days with impaired work productivity was reduced from 8.0 before use to 3.4 after EAP use. This study also found that, 25% of all EAP cases reported missing at least a half day or more of work before their use of the EAP. Among this group, the average level of work absenteeism was reduced from 7.2 days to 4.8 days, respectively, for the 30 days before EAP use versus the 30 days after EAP use concluded.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The effects obtained in these three large-scale research studies, when averaged together, indicate that for employee users of EAP counseling services: (1) the number of days being absent from work in the past month improved by 1.00 day; and (2) there was a 22% improvement in their work productivity over the past month.</Para>

              <Section2 ID="Sec002116">
                <Heading>EAP Cost-Benefit</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">As with other areas of occupational health and wellness, it is important to be able to show the value of providing services beyond just user satisfaction and clinical outcomes (Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002114">2008a</CitationRef>). Over the past 20 years, several dozen studies have demonstrated the financial cost-benefit of EAPs (see reviews by Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002119">2010b</CitationRef>; Attridge &amp; Amaral, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002123">2002</CitationRef>; Blum &amp; Roman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002141">1995</CitationRef>; Christie &amp; Harlow, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002153">2007</CitationRef>). These studies have examined savings from a range of outcomes, including health care claims costs, disability claims costs, avoided employee turnover, and workplace performance costs due to lost productivity and days at work. The common finding is that use of EAPs by employees with more severe clinical issues have contributed to long-term net reductions in overall health care costs for individual employees and their families that far exceed the cost of the EAP services, even when including the short-term increases in the costs of providing appropriate professional treatment for alcohol/drug and mental health disorders. Several of the best examples of this research are the cost-benefit studies of the internal EAPs at Abbott Laboratories (Dainas &amp; Marks, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002163">2000</CitationRef>), Chevron (Collins, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002154">1998</CitationRef>) and Southern California Edison (Conlin, Amaral &amp; Harlow, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002155">1996</CitationRef>). The landmark cost-benefit study of the EAP at the McDonnell Douglas Corporation (Smith &amp; Mahoney, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021154">1990</CitationRef>; see critique by Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002118">2010a</CitationRef>) was replicated a year later at the company’s helicopter division. Again, the analysis of objective company data revealed net cost savings from several areas over a multiyear period for the employees with alcohol/substance abuse and psychiatric problems who experienced EAP-directed behavioral health case management services, compared to other cases without EAP support (Alexander &amp; Alexander Consulting Group, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00211">1990</CitationRef>). A key mechanism behind the positive results in these studies is that the EAPs were effective at helping employees with substance abuse issues to navigate successfully through the many treatment options available, and with providing follow-up support and case-­management assistance after treatment to reduce relapse issues and improve return-to-work efforts (Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002119">2010b</CitationRef>). Indeed, sometimes the “leverage” that comes from the EAP counselor being affiliated with the employer or union can help an employee with substance abuse troubles to finally get into treatment in order to keep his job or union member status (Attridge &amp; Bennett, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002124">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">With regard to calculating a specific dollar figure from a cost-benefit analysis, researchers have documented Return-on-Investment (ROI) estimates of $3 or more (up to $10) return for every $1 dollar invested in the EAP (Blaze-Temple &amp; Howat, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002140">1997</CitationRef>; Dainas &amp; Marks, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002163">2000</CitationRef>; Hargrave &amp; Hiatt, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002185">2005</CitationRef>; Hargrave, Hiatt, Alexander &amp; Shaffer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002186">2008</CitationRef>; Jorgensen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002193">2007</CitationRef>; McClellan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021114">1990</CitationRef>; Yamatani, Santangelo, Maue &amp; Heath, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021170">1999</CitationRef>). It is important to note that the source of the cost-benefit examined in the these studies is limited to the small subset of the total EAP counselor caseload that has more serious addiction or mental health issues and that the cost savings are only realized over a multiyear period of time. In contrast, the financial benefits from improved work performance (i.e., reduced presenteeism and absenteeism) are present in many more EAP cases (both mild and more severe) than are cost-savings from health care claims or disability claim cases and they are evident soon after EAP use (Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002120">2010c</CitationRef>). Because of these factors, workplace-based cost savings from EAP usually comprise the largest part of the total dollar return to the employer when it has been included in ROI analyses with several other sources of cost savings (Goetzel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002176">2007</CitationRef>; Goetzel &amp; Ozminkowski, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002178">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>ROI Calculation Example for EAP Workplace Outcomes</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Even though it is a common and consisently positive outcome, some EAPs are hesitant to present an ROI to their customer organizations that includes workplace outcomes. Perhaps this reluctance is due to concerns of how to best convert the workplace outcomes into financial metrics that employers will believe (Gallagher &amp; Morgan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002172">2002</CitationRef>). However, consulting experience in this area shows that this “dollarzing” problem can be overcome (Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00219">2002</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002113">2007</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002115">2008b</CitationRef>; Fuller, Attridge &amp; Doherty, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002171">2001</CitationRef>). The following math example illustrates the steps involved in this kind of ROI calculation.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Hourly Compensation Rate</Emphasis>. To start, one needs to asign a dollar amount to an hour of work. Let’s assume a company has an average hourly wage of $20 paid to the employee directly (i.e., what is paid in their paycheck). Using the hourly paid wage rate is adequate, but incomplete in most circumstances that involve other company-sponored benefits as part of the total compensation to employees. For full-time employees, the dollar value of company-paid benefits is thus added to the hourly wage rate to yield the full compensation rate. For example, it is customary to add 25% of the paid wage rate as an estimate of the additional compensation value of benefits (i.e., health, disability, retirement) paid by the employer on behalf of the employee ($20 wage rate X 25%  =  $5 benefit load value; so $20 wage  +  $5 benefit load  =  $25 total compensation rate). One could further adjust this rate for the mix of employees with and without benefits.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Assigning Dollar Value to Work Absence Outcome</Emphasis>. What is a day of work worth in dollars? Some analysts treat absence days as worth only the sum of the hourly compensation rate applied to a typical day of work (Trogdon, Finkelstein, Reyes &amp; Deitz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021163">2009</CitationRef>). But this ignores the value of the lost productivity when the employee is not at work. Intsead, what more advanced researchers do is to add in the financial estimate of the dollar value of work productivity (see below) as part of the dollar value of an absence (Goetzel et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002177">2004</CitationRef>). While this approach creates a much larger dollar value, it is actually more realistic from a business perspective. Why have a worker at all if all he returns in financial value back to the business is a dollar amount that is equal to his level of compensation? This break-even logic is not used by the business to justify hiring a new worker; therefore, it should not be used in a ROI analysis.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Assigning Dollar Value to Work Productivity Outcome</Emphasis>. What is an hour of productive work worth in dollars? Although this qustion can be answered in many ways, one simple approach has been to apply what is called a “Revenue Capactity Factor” (RCF) as a mathematical mutliplier to the rate of employee compensation to reflect the capacity that an employee has to generate revenue or financial benefit (broadly considered) to the organization from their work. The RFC for each employee varies due to many factors, such as job grade and role within the organization, as more senior and more skilled employess are worth more (as this is usually reflected in their having higher compensation relative to other less tenured or less skilled staff). A conserative default RCF is 2.0. Thus, assuming a $25 per hour compensation rate X 2.0 RCF  =  $50 productivity value per hour for an employee working at normal productivity. For an employee who is at work but only working at 50% of his normal level of productivity (called presenteeism), this is a dollarized loss of $25 per hour ($50 per hour compensation X 50%). Applying this to the dollar value of work absence, missing one full day of work (at an 8 h work shift) is a productivity loss to the employer of $400 (8 h X $50 per hour as all of the productivity is lost). The loss of the compensation is then added to this lost productivity total as well (assuming the employee has a certain number of paid days off from work per year).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">EAP Outcome Return</Emphasis>. The estimated financial value of work productivity and work absence can now be applied to the outcomes data from the EAP. The financial value of the avoided further work productivity loss from EAP is $1,750 per case. This is based on 20 work days of 8 h per day in a month for a full-time employee (160 h) at 22% improvement per hour in productivity. This results in 35 h of productivity return at $50 value per hour. The financial value of avoided further work absence is $600 per case. This is based on a combination of two parts: Part 1  =  8 h for one day of avoided absence X paid compensation, which is 8 h X $25 per hour  =  $200; and Part 2  =  the lost productivity that was due to missing work altogether and having zero productivity  =  8 h of full productivity loss X $50 value of productivity per hour  =  $400; combined these two parts are worth $600.</Para>

In practice, this figure can be adjusted, if needed, depending on if employees have paid time off from work or not (or if one ­contends that lost productivity during work absence is made up again in the future through extra unpaid overtime work), what is the appropriate RCF rate, what is the most relevant period of outcome effect duration (only 1 month in this example), and so forth.

              <Heading>EAP Trends</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">This part of the chapter examines various trends in the field of EAP. Current initiatives are occurring for EAPs and alcohol issues, disability cases, work/life, wellness and prevention, employee engagement, and technology. Also presented are the findings of a new research study of EAP Trends from the perspectives of professionals in the field.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec002119">
                <Heading>Trend 1: EAP and Alcohol Issues</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The last several years have seen renewed interest in the early core technology EAP focus on alcohol and addictions (Attridge &amp; Wallace, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002130">2009</CitationRef>). EAPs are being asked to do more in the area of early identification and encouraging access into professional treatment. The Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) approach is being used by many EAPs to identify and manage risky and hazardous alcohol use and dependence within the workplace (McPherson et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021119">2009</CitationRef>). EAPs are also providing training to other staff at partner programs (such as wellness and work/life) on how to use scientifically validated brief screening tools that can help identify mental health and substance abuse problems among clients of their programs (Bray et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002142">2009</CitationRef>; Goplerud &amp; McPherson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002179">2011</CitationRef>). These screening tools can be added to population health risk assessments, to intake processes in other health management or coaching programs, and at primary care settings. A driver of this trend for SBIRT activity by EAPs is that most experts now consider addiction to be a chronic, relapsing brain disease with a complex etiology and clinical course (Gearhardt et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002173">2011</CitationRef>; Saitz, Larson, Labelle, Richardson &amp; Samet, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021145">2008</CitationRef>). This view of addiction demands a more sophisticated approach to treatment. Most addiction treatment providers offer patients with mild or moderate severity symptoms brief and episodic care, with little or no long-term follow-up (McLellan &amp; Meyers, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021115">2004</CitationRef>). In contrast, chronic disease management care approaches—such as the Physician Health Plan addiction care programs in Canada (Brewster, Kaufmann, Hutchison &amp; MacWilliam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002143">2008</CitationRef>) and the United States (McLellan, Skipper, Campbell &amp; DuPont, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021116">2008</CitationRef>)—have more than doubled the typical success rates of the best episodic addiction ­service programs. PHP has seen success rates for abstinence from alcohol and drug use as high as 85% of all program participants over 5 years. These PHP programs use a holistic model that includes qualified service providers, a progression from more intensive to less intensive care settings, case management, family centered care, and long-term monitoring to manage relapse. The success of this approach indicates that it is possible to improve outcomes in addiction treatment by adopting ­elements of the chronic care approach and strengthening linkages across the continuum of care (Norlien Foundation, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021123">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec002120">
                <Heading>Trend 2: EAP and Disability</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Another trend is for more EAP support of employees on disability leave for mental health and ­addiction disorders (Attridge &amp; Wallace, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002131">2010</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002132">2011</CitationRef>). Mental health disability affects between 1 and 2% of working adults each year, and is the fastest growing health-related disability in the United States and Canada over the past 20 years (Sroujian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021157">2003</CitationRef>; Williams, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021167">2006</CitationRef>). The past decade has seen a dramatic rise in the costs of disability-related claims (Carruthers, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002151">2010</CitationRef>). Once an employee has a disability, employers and unions are required to make every reasonable effort, short of undue hardship to the company, to accommodate these workers. Implementing a Return-to-Work (RTW) program meets the employer’s legal duty to accommodate. The goal of RTW is to facilitate the return of disabled workers to safe, meaningful, and productive work. These programs are based on the philosophy that people can safely perform progressively more demanding levels of work while also participating in the ­process of recovery and getting medical and/or mental health care for their problem. These programs must be collaborative and sensitive to the particular challenges in preparing the employee to return to work after treatment for addictions in order to avoid a relapse (Pomaki et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021130">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">An ally for disability case managers can be the EAP (Brunnelle &amp; Lui, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002144">2003</CitationRef>). For the employee who is on disability leave, the EAP can provide RTW support services, such as preparing the supervisor and employee for reentry into the workplace. EAPs can also assist with psychological job analysis and provide supervisory consultation and educational services on an ongoing basis to assist those at the work site while the employee is away on leave. Due to the frequent comorbidity of mental disorders with other medical conditions, some employers now mandate a psychological clinical assessment as part of the requirement of anyone applying for disability benefits—not just those with mental disorder as the primary cause (The Hartford Group, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021160">2007</CitationRef>). The EAP may be able to perform these assessments or assist with making referrals to others who can provide it. Thus, the EAP can provide a valuable role in coordinating such care and supporting the employee and their family through this transitional period.</Para>

                <Heading>Trend 3: EAP and Work/Life</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Collaboration with other benefits programs has been a growth area for EAPs in the past decade. Many EAPs now partner with a wide range of other workplace-based programs and benefits. The number of EAPs with “integration activity” increased from about 1 in 4 in 1994, to over 1 in 3 in 2002, and it is now present at the majority of all EAPs (Herlihy &amp; Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021173">2005</CitationRef>). The most common integration partner has been with work/life programs and services. Work/Life programs include a wide range of services (Gornick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002180">2002</CitationRef>). Typically, these services include: workplace flexibility policies; paid and unpaid time off; childcare; eldercare; financial education and support; and community involvement (Lingle, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021101">2004</CitationRef>). Work/Life services focus on normal life experiences, such as finding appropriate care for aging parents and attempts to prevent more serious problems developing due to personal or work stressors an individual may be facing. Often, the focus of these services is saving the employee time by carrying out time-consuming research rather than tackling problems that the employee could not manage as effectively own her own. Part of the reason for this growth in integrated programming is a natural development response to the rise in the popularity of work/life programs and the benefits to the organization from greater collaboration between EAP and work/life (Attridge et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002126">2005</CitationRef>; Csiernik, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002160">2005a</CitationRef>). The EAP and work/life fields often share similar goals of supporting employees and working families, while also supporting the needs of the employer and the broader workplace (Jacobson &amp; Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002191">2010</CitationRef>). Both fields have a work focus and embrace the notion that one’s work life and ­personal life influence each other. Both fields also typically report to HR or another department within the work organization, with services being managed internally but having most of their client-contact services provided by a network of external contractors. In many companies, EAPs and work/life services are provided by the same program or sold under the same contract; however, they may actually be business arrangements in which one program partners with another program to meet the needs of an organization. The 2011 <Emphasis Type="Italic">Open Minds Industry Report</Emphasis> noted a large increase since 2002 in these kinds of integrated models, with EAPs now being routinely bundled with providers of work/life ­services as a “one-stop shop” program for employer purchasers.</Para>

                <Heading>Trend 4: EAP and Wellness/Prevention</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Although EAP and work/life are already closely aligned, EAP’s also have a growing role in ­supporting wellness and health prevention programs (Goetzel &amp; Ozminkowski, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002178">2006</CitationRef>). According to (Mulvihill, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021122">2003</CitationRef>), the core practices of these programs include the following: (1) strategic planning to prevent disease, decrease health risks, and contain rising health care costs, (2) conducting health screenings and risk stratification, (3) providing risk-related health management interventions (exercise, behavior change programs, health coaching, educational materials, nurse advice lines, and disease management), and (4) ongoing evaluation and metrics. Wellness programs reach employees and their family members through many different channels, including office visits, phone calls, Internet resources, and onsite workplace events (such as wellness fairs and health risk screenings). Many EAPs now support employee in making lifestyle behavioral changes after learning the results of health risk appraisal (HRA) screenings (Birkland &amp; Birkland, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002139">2005</CitationRef>). Employees struggling to change chronic behaviors related to weight loss, diet and nutrition, and smoking cessation particularly value this kind of encouragement and practical advice. EAPs also are playing an increasing role in identifying and treating chronic behavioral health conditions (such as depression and anxiety) that negatively affect ­productivity and quality of life (Caggianelli &amp; Carruthers, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002150">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A recent survey of 200 professionals in the EAP field provides evidence of the role of EAP in ­supporting prevention and wellness (Bennett &amp; Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002137">2008</CitationRef>). The study assessed the percentage of respondents that provided eight different types of “prevention services” at their EAP at least on a quarterly basis. The results revealed that the most frequently offered prevention services were alcohol screening/training (41%) or drug screening/training (40%). Other findings were that about 1 in 4 EAPs regularly conducted screening and training for depression (25%), for workplace violence/­bullying (23%), and for other health management issues (such as anxiety; 17%). EAPs also ­conducted prevention-oriented trainings on fostering better relationships among work teams (32%), and at home in the area of personal/marital relationships (15%). In contrast, few EAPs conducted cardiovascular screening/training (9%). Thus, in this study, roughly a third of EAPs delivered prevention services on mental health, substance abuse, and workplace behavioral risk issues.</Para>

                <Heading>Trend 5: EAP and Employee Engagement</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">EAPs can also get involved with company-wide efforts to improve the overall health of the ­organization by increasing employee engagement (Pugh &amp; Dietz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021133">2008</CitationRef>; Seidl, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021147">2007</CitationRef>). <Emphasis Type="Italic">Work engagement</Emphasis> is a term used to describe the extent to which employees are involved with, committed to, enthusiastic and ­passionate about their work (Macey &amp; Schneider, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021104">2008</CitationRef>). Many organizations now engage in company-wide measurement of employee engagement levels and related constructs (Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002117">2009b</CitationRef>). The results of these measurement programs can then be used to improve HR practices and employee benefit services and other training programs, all of which are activities that EAPs can help to coordinate and implement as changes at the organizational level (Hyde, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002190">2008</CitationRef>). EAPs could add specific items on engagement to their intake and follow-up clinical assessment processes to measure changes in employee engagement for individual users of the EAP. The finding that strength-based styles of management and supervisory communication can improve employee engagement is good for the EAPs that have staff experienced at providing training in this area of positive psychology (Taranowski, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021159">2009</CitationRef>). Thus, the engagement movement has created a greater potential role for EAP to better serve their employer clients through offering assistance in measurement and training areas that support improved engagement at both the individual and the organizational levels.</Para>

                <Heading>Trend 6: EAP and Technology</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">There is an increasing use of new technological modalities to assist employees to better manage their health and to get access to related services. Web sites for EAPs are becoming more elaborate and now typically offer access to lists of counselors and other care providers, tip sheets, educational webinars, and a wide range of self-assessment tools (Richard, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021136">2009</CitationRef>). The use of Internet-based tools for the delivery of clinical services is less common, but is advancing as a new practice model (Klion, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002198">2011</CitationRef>). The early adopters of online clinical services have been more prevalent among Canadian EFAPs (Parnass et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021128">2008</CitationRef>; Wittes &amp; Speyer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021174">2009</CitationRef>) than among EAPs in the United States. In general, the technology for providing online therapeutic services for mental health and addiction treatment is widely available. This kind of clinical care is called a variety of names, including online therapy, cybercounseling, e-counseling, Internet-based therapy, among others (Christensen &amp; Hickie, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002152">2010</CitationRef>). The majority of online therapy today takes place via exchanges of e-mail between the client and ­counselor. Less popular is the practice of online therapy that takes place in “real time,” often using chat-based computer interfaces (e.g., via Instant Messaging—IM) or specialized Web site tools for live videoconferencing sessions between client and counselor (Richardson, Frueh, Grubaugh, Egede &amp; Elhai, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021138">2009</CitationRef>). Other applications in this area feature the interaction of multiple clients at the same time for supportive group therapy, with the interaction managed by a counselor (Griffiths, Crisp, Christensen, Mackinnon &amp; Bennett, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002184">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">One reason for the trend in techno-therapy is that the stigma associated with addressing addictions and delivering prevention programs is reduced when using the Internet, where it can be accessed at anytime, from anywhere with relative anonymity and privacy. Another reason is that these services are appealing to people who may otherwise go untreated because they do not like certain aspects of ­in-person therapy. In addition, many people already trust and use online technologies as an everyday part of their lives for banking, health care, social networking and other purposes and extending this use to get help for psychological issues is a reasonable next step (Leibert &amp; Archer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021100">2006</CitationRef>; Young, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021172">2005</CitationRef>). A growing body of international research indicates that Internet-based delivery of mental health psychotherapy services for many common mental health conditions is as effective as traditional face-to-face treatment conducted in clinical offices (Attridge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002122">2011</CitationRef>). More than a dozen high quality studies using a randomized control trial (RCT) experimental research design have tested the general clinical effectiveness of Internet-based psychotherapy (Griffiths &amp; Christensen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002183">2006</CitationRef>), and many more studies have been done using a variety of less rigorous research designs. All combined, the general finding is for positive clinical outcomes from online therapy (see reviews by Barak, Hen, Boniel-Nissim &amp; Shapira, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002134">2008</CitationRef>; Reger &amp; Gahm, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021135">2009</CitationRef>; Rochlen, Zack &amp; Speyer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021139">2004</CitationRef>). Thus, e-therapy has strong research support that provides evidence of its clinical effectiveness, particularly for common kinds of mental health cases with mild or moderate severity that typify EAP counseling services.</Para>

                <Heading>New Study on EAP Trends</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A new research study explored the trends in EAP from the perspective of those in the EAP field (Attridge &amp; Burke, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002125">2011</CitationRef>). This study surveyed senior level EAP professionals to explore trends in the use, importance, business value, and perceived viability of key kinds of EA services. The potential for providing more strategic consulting by EAPs at the organizational level was also examined. A final issue of interest was to determine which societal trends are shaping the future of the industry. Before getting to the results, the study procedures and sample are noted.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Study Methodology</Emphasis>. Survey data were collected via a secure Web site from 150 professionals in the EAP industry from the United States and Canada. Most of these people were in senior management or clinical leadership roles, and were associated with the EAP field in a variety of ways, including working for external vendors of EAP services (51%), working for internal programs (23%), being an individual provider of clinical services (11%), being a consultant or academic (5%), or “other” (9%). Seven EAP services were included: (1) counseling with assessment, brief clinical support and referral, (2) management consultations and organizational support, (3) critical incident response, (4) integration of EAP with work/life and wellness, (5) high-risk case finding and long term case management, (6) support for employees on STD/LTD disability leave, and (7) technology and Web-enabled services. These services were rated on three issues: (a) estimated frequency of use, (b) importance to defining what EAP should be, and (c) trend in business value in the marketplace.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Study Results</Emphasis>. The study identified three major groupings of services (see Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00214">21.4</InternalRef>). The first cluster of services is called the Core EAP Services. These include counseling and referral for individual employees, manager consultations and organizational support, and critical incident response. The second cluster of services is called the “Pareto” EAP Services. The services involve using the EAP to find and support individuals in need of behavioral health expertise for treating high-risk conditions, and for assistance with return-to-work for mental health and addiction disability. The term “pareto” refers to the economic concept of a small segment of a population that is associated with a large share of an outcome of interest (in this case, a few cases that create a large annual cost in health care expenses and work performance losses). The third cluster of services is called Connecting EAP Services. These services use the Internet and other new technologies to connect employees to counselor and other resources, and also the benefits of integration of the EAP with Wellness and Work/Life programs to better engage individuals in self-care, prevention and family support services.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00214">

                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Proactive EAP</Emphasis>. While acknowledging the need to continue to provide the EAP core services and to expand the pareto and connecting kinds of services, there is also merit in adding a new set of services through which the EAP has a more proactive and strategic role within the organization (Burke &amp; Paul, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002147">2011</CitationRef>). Many organizations are hungry for services that can help them address more complex issues at the organizational level. Issues at the top of this wish list include how to foster greater employee engagement and productivity, how to retain talent and develop their executives, how to comprehensively support employees with high-risk complex health conditions, and how to create a healthy and psychologically safe work culture for all employees. This issue was examined in the study with a qualitative question: <Emphasis Type="Italic">Given your knowledge of the marketplace, can the value of an EAP be enhanced by also offering services that provide more of a strategic, proactive and consultative approach to the organization?</Emphasis>
                </Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The results found that 91% of the sample responded favorably to this question. Thus, more than 9 in 10 EAP professionals recognized the opportunity for EAPs to become more proactive and strategic in focus. Many of the respondents lamented the limitations of having a largely “reactive model” of EAP practices with use of the EAP being dependent upon self-referrals. Others felt that the basic model of service should be reengineered. EAPs could take better advantage of their positive reputation as being experts in handling psychological and behavioral issues in the workplace. Some commented that EAPs are too isolated and need to be more deeply integrated into wellness and other workplace sponsored employee and family support programs. This would mean that assessments and referrals could be done more rapidly and more systematically via shared technological tools and by more regular interaction between the staff in different programs. However, a caveat is in order because roughly 1 in 4 of the respondents—although still positive in general—also expressed some reservations about making this kind of proactive service offering a reality for their EAP business.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Influences on the Future of EAP.</Emphasis> A second qualitative item asked about which societal trends are shaping the future of the industry: <Emphasis Type="Italic">In the bigger picture, what societal or business trend do you think will contribute most to the viability and success of the employee assistance industry in the future?</Emphasis> The results for this item yielded the following four themes. Technology was the most commonly cited influence, with social media, online services, instant access, and self-management via technology as key aspects. For example, a 67-year-old female clinical consultant had the comment that “Technology and web-enabled services for education, self-care and clinical support from EAP counselors [is needed] because of the societal focus on quick, easy 24  ×  7 access that’s self initiated to address issues or secure information.” The second theme was of workplace change. Examples of change included health care reform and parity laws in the United States, the poor economy, increasing social and domestic violence, employee retention issues, an aging population, and globalization. For example, a 56-year-old male professor commented that: “We need more clarity about the role of the EAP in the medical insurance industry. Some health insurance plans offer EAP-type counseling as part of their services, although at no extra costs, but also without having the necessary EAP expertise.” The influence of the health and productivity movement on EAP was the third theme. This included issues of EAP partnering with other workplace programs and benefits, the impact of behavioral health issues on work performance, and creating a culture of health at the organization. A 52-year-old male CEO of an EAP commented that: “Promotion of employee mental health is just as important as physical health, which can lead to innovation and increased competitiveness.” The last theme for this item focused on concerns for the future viability of the industry. Examples included a need to restate the value proposition for EAP, changing the name from EAP to something else, and the need for more research and industry benchmarks to guide operational practices in order to avoid becoming a ­non-profession.</Para>

              <Heading>Summary</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">This chapter presents a research-based overview of employee assistance programs. The first part of the chapter provides an overview of EAP, with sections on the following: the history of the field, the primary activities of EAP, the unique qualities of EAP, the main models and markets, the promotion and use of EAPs, and the professional standards for the industry. This second part of the chapter examines the state of empirical evidence for EAP services. EAP is an applied field with active participation in various professional associations and meetings and it has an applied methodology to most of its research. The historical themes of research in the field over the last 25 years have focused on clinical issues of alcohol and drug abuse, psychological/emotional problems, and critical incidents/trauma and relationship issues. The research literature supports the clinical effectiveness of EAP and finds high levels of client satisfaction and positive outcomes in areas of health care costs and workplace performance. This final part of the chapter highlights several trends in the field of EAP, including renewed interest in EAP support for alcohol issues, disability cases, work/life, wellness and prevention, employee engagement, and technology. These themes were replicated and put into a more ­coherent interpretive model from the findings of a study of trends in EAP.</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In conclusion, EAPs currently provide assistance to employees and their dependents for a variety of work-related and personal issues. These programs are found in most large and medium-sized organizations in North America. Individual counseling is shown by research to be the flagship of employee assistance, and is its most popular service component. EAP services are generally effective for the individuals who use them, and they tend to produce a positive financial ROI for the organization. But the present day version of EAPs is underpriced and underutilized, which suggests a need to change with the times and to innovate in ways that can bring more value to the organizations they serve. Several trends are driving EAPs to reexamine and redefine themselves. The 2011 trend study revealed strong agreement among EAP professionals concerning the opportunity for EAPs to play a more proactive and consultative role in the workplaces they serve.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Along these lines, it may now be instructive to review how EAPs can support other aspects of occupational health and wellness. This is done by noting how EAPs fit into the topics of some of the other chapters in this Handbook:

              <Para TextBreak="No">Another significant trend that has only briefly been noted so far in this chapter is how EAP is going global. Due to its success, there is now market saturation, with many companies already having EAP services (at least among large and medium size employers) and also a mature product life cycle stage for traditional EA services in the United States and Canada. However, there remains significant growth for the EAP industry in other countries. This exciting developmental trend for the field is now reviewed. Indeed, various forms of EAPs are now active in many countries around the world (Maiden, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021106">2001</CitationRef>). As expected, the specifics of how EAP is defined and used varies based on the country’s legal system, culture healthcare system, treatment resources for mental health and substance abuse and views toward behavioral health and work/life balance issues. A recent book profiles EAPs in 50 different countries (Masi &amp; Tisone, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021113">2010</CitationRef>). There are member chapters of the EAPA organization located in Australia, Canada, Greece, Ireland, Japan, South Africa, and the UK, and recent development activity for new member chapters in Chile and China. Over a hundred research articles have examined aspects of international EAPs (see Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00213">21.3</InternalRef>). There has also been qualitative research on the progress of EAP development in many countries and regions, including Argentina (Lardani &amp; Lorenzo, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002199">2010</CitationRef>), Australia (Kirk, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002196">2008</CitationRef>; Kirk &amp; Brown, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002197">2005</CitationRef>), China (Yin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021171">2011</CitationRef>) Europe (Hoskinson &amp; Beer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002189">2005</CitationRef>; Nowlan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021124">2006</CitationRef>; Malhomme, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021110">2008</CitationRef>; Quinlan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021134">2005</CitationRef>), Germany (Barth, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002135">2006</CitationRef>; Gehlenborg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002174">2001</CitationRef>), India (Baskar, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002136">2011</CitationRef>; Henry, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002188">2011</CitationRef>; Siddiqui &amp; Sukhramani, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021153">2001</CitationRef>), Ireland (Powell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021132">2001</CitationRef>), Israel (Katan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002194">2001</CitationRef>), and South Africa (Maiden, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021105">1992</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In the European region a new professional association for EAP providers, called The Employee Assistance European Forum, was initiated in 2002 (Buon &amp; Taylor, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002145">2007</CitationRef>). The activity of the EAPs in this part of the world is also the topic of new research project funded by a grant from the Employee Assistance Research Foundation (EARF, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002169">2011</CitationRef>). The study is entitled “EAP in Continental Europe: State of the Art and Future Challenges.” It will survey employers and employees in six European countries to examine the characteristics of existing EAPs and discover future needs of providers and customer organizations in the European region. A similar research project, also funded by EARF (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002169">2011</CitationRef>), is now in progress by the US-based National Behavioral Consortium. It will survey EAP ­providers in North America to profile the operational characteristics and core business metrics that represent the current state of employee assistance programs. Thus, globalization offers many new opportunities for EAP (Burke, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002146">2008</CitationRef>). But there are also many contextual and cultural factors that must to be appreciated for it to be successful. Indeed, as global EAP vendors have branched out into other countries, it has been necessary to use local counselors and other staff in order to provide services that match the language, cultural identity, and logistical needs of their customers. It is hoped that this indigenous staffing model will ultimately result in new innovations in EAP practices and products (Pompe, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021131">2011</CitationRef>). Alternatively, for the home-grown EAP programs that have started up recently in other countries that are trying to adapt aspects of existing EAP models and services from other places, it is a challenge to determine which elements of the core technology and primary services apply to their environment and will be effective (Masi, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0021112">2011</CitationRef>). Just as each country is different, so must be the manifestation of EAP that supports the organizations in each country. Along with the escalating worldwide interest in EAP, the field is moving in several directions to enhance their value to organizations and better reach employees in distress. The evidence and trends reviewed in this chapter indicate that EAPs are uniquely connected to the workplace, and are able support organizational health and wellness in multiple ways.</Para>
