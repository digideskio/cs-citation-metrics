              <Para>Health effects due to air pollution and the potential damage from climate change are probably today’s most important environmental problems. Of particular interest is the simulation of the origin and fate of particular matter (PM). When chemical processes are taken into account, the uncertainty can become significant for secondary formed PM. The ability to model such complex formation processes are of direct relevance in air quality applications as well as climate modelling. Model evaluation studies are essential for determining model performance as well as assessing model deficiencies, and are the focus of the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII). The chemistry-transport model system COSMO-MUSCAT participates in this initiative.</Para>
              <Para>In this paper the robustness and variability of the model results against changes in the model setup are analyzed. Special focus is given to the formation of secondary particulate matter and the ability to reproduce unusually high levels of PM10 in Central Europe caused by long-range transported smoke of widespread agricultural burning and forest fires in western Russia. Seven different model configurations are investigated in this study. The COSMO-MUSCAT results are evaluated in comparison with ground-base measurements in Central Europe. The analysis is performed for two selected periods in April/ May 2006 and October 2006 which are characterized by elevated concentrations of PM. Both periods were characterized on the one hand, by longer episodes with stable high pressure and moderate winds from the east, and on the other hand, by lows with westerly winds. Additionally, the impact of biomass burning emissions from wildland fires on the particle distribution is investigated for both periods. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the results is studied against the used grid resolution and the meteorological forcing. Here, COSMO is applied with different horizontal grid sizes and, alternatively, forced by reanalysis data with finer resolution.</Para>

              <Heading>The Model System COSMO-MUSCAT</Heading>
              <Para>The modelling department of the IfT has developed the multiscale model system COSMO-MUSCAT [<CitationRef CitationID="CR009410">10</CitationRef>]. It is qualified for process studies as well as the operational forecast of pollutants in local and regional areas [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00941">1</CitationRef>]. The model system consists of two online-coupled codes. The operational forecast model COSMO is a non-hydrostatic and compressible meteorological model and solves the governing equations on the basis of a terrain-following grid [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00945">5</CitationRef>]. Driven by the meteorological model, the chemistry transport model MUSCAT treats the atmospheric transport as well as chemical transformations for several gas phase species and particle populations. The transport processes include advection, turbulent diffusion, sedimentation, dry and wet deposition. The modelling system is used for several air quality applications [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00943">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00947">7</CitationRef>].</Para>

              <Heading>Model Setup</Heading>
              <Para>One aim of this study is to check the robustness and the sensitivity of the model results against changes in the model setup. COSMO-MUSCAT is applied on uniform horizontal grids with two different grid sizes (approximately 28 and 14 km). The 28 km results are extracted from the annual data of 2006, which are provided for the AQMEII database. Furthermore, a one-way nesting strategy for the COSMO-MUSCAT grids is used. In each of the regions N1 and N2, the meteorological code COSMO works on a uniform grid. The online-coupled MUSCAT uses different resolutions (coarse near the boundaries and finer in the inner regions). This corresponds to a two-way nesting for the chemistry-transport part. In our configuration, the N2 region of interest covers Central Europe. The N2 run is forced by finer meteorological reanalysis data of the DWD provided by COSMO simulations. All these simulations are performed using the mass-based approach for the description of aerosol processes in MUSCAT. Additionally, an extended version of the modal aerosol model M7 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00949">9</CitationRef>] is utilized to study the sensitivity of the results against a more detailed aerosol modeling.</Para>

              <Para>Long-term simulations were performed for a spring and an autumn period to study the contribution of secondary aerosol and wild-land fires on the PM concentration in Central Europe, an area that features continental as well as maritime air masses. The influence of different meteorological conditions and model setups on the long-range transport as well as formation of secondary PM is analyzed. We choose the period from the 21st April to the 20th of May 2006 and the month of October 2006 for simulation. The first periods is characterized by unusually high levels of PM10 in the beginning of May caused by long-range transported smoke of widespread agricultural burning and forest fires in western Russia and the Ukraine [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00946">6</CitationRef>]. Mixtures of pollutants were transported over the whole Europe causing severe degradation of air quality and reaching Great Britain around the 8th of May 2006. High concentrations of several pollutants were observed along the plume pass way. A frontal rain passing over Europe finished the episode.</Para>
              <Para>The model performance was compared for different model configurations (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00941">94.1</InternalRef>). Meteorological processes mainly force the transport and transformation of PM. An appropriate description of these processes is of essential interest in chemistry transport modeling. COSMO-MUSCAT can reproduce the range of PM10 in the first decade of May but overestimates the measured values especially during the period with high concentrations. The finer resolved meteorological simulations calculate lower peaks in the PM concentrations. This different behavior seems to be caused mainly by the PBL height modeled by COSMO. The N2 nesting approach and the forcing by COSMO reanalysis data shows the best performance. The coarse horizontal resolution in the N1 (28 km) and N1_96h setups leads to an overestimation of the PM10 burden. Here the runs with 96-h simulation cycles show a slightly better performance than for the setup with shorter cycles. The temporal variations are also captured by all model setups. However The N2 approach tends to produce higher peaks in nitrate and ammonium during the April/May simulation. Significant differences between the N1 runs and the nested N2 approach are observed especially in the end of October <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00941">

              <Para>The sensitivity of the simulation results against the grid resolution and the used meteorological forcing data was investigated. The results were compared with a comprehensive set of ground-based measurements at seven selected monitoring stations in Germany. This comparison was performed for concentrations of particulate matter as well as daily mean values of the corresponding compositions. Most of the model configurations are able to capture the PM10 measurements. But PM2.5 is underpredicted significantly in nearly all cases. The simulated ammonia, sulphate and nitrate concentrations show a moderate agreement. The most differences are observed between the mass-based and modal approach for PM10. However, there is a better agreement for PM2.5.</Para>

                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: Most models underpredict sulfate compared to the observed data. Your study shows overprediction. Please elaborate the differences in your model (compared to other models) that may be producing more sulfate than other models.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: In the applied RACM-MIM2 chemistry [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00942">2</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00948">8</CitationRef>], sulfuric acid is formed only by the reaction of SO<Subscript>2</Subscript> and OH. As model studies reveal, this approach underestimates sulfate levels in Europe especially in winter. Therefore, an additional oxidation pathway in the aqueous phase is parameterized as a first order reaction with a reaction constant depending on the relative humidity and cloud cover [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00944">4</CitationRef>]. We believe that the meteorological forcing mainly causes the overprediction of sulfate in the annual run with 28 km horizontal grid size. Here the COSMO model generates too much humidity. This was not the case for other model setups. For a more detailed discussion we refer to Wolke et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR009410">10</CitationRef>]. Note that such overprediction of sulfate was not assessed for COSMO-MUSCAT in previous model evaluation studies (e.g., [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00947">7</CitationRef>]).</SimplePara>
