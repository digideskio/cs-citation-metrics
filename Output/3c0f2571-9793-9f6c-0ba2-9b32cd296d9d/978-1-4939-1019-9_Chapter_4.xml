          <Para>Cultivation remains the foundation of weed management in organic farming. Low and variable efficacy, increasingly unpredictable weather, cost, and perceived harm to soil quality inspire organic farmers, to varying degrees, to learn and implement ecologically based management practices. Crop rotation and cover cropping are system-level practices frequently cited as weed management tools; however, unless their implementation is guided by knowledge of weed biology and targeting sensitive life history stages, these practices may have minimal benefit, or even increase weed populations. To reduce cultivation events or improve the outcome of existing events, reduction in the weed seedbank is required, a management goal increasingly adopted by organic farmers. In diversified systems, short-season cash or cover crops can be grown in sequence to completely preempt weed seed rain. Because many weed seeds have relatively short half-lives in the soil, a single season without replenishment by seed rain will have a large effect on their seedbank. In addition to preventing such “credits” to the weed seedbank, organic growers often employ management practices to “debit” the seedbank. Knowledge of weed emergence periodicity and the importance of germination as a mechanism to deplete the seedbank, for example, have contributed to refinements in the use of fallow periods, sometimes varying between early and late season, to avoid proliferation of particular weed species. Innovations in cultivation tools promise improved efficacy, greater working rates, and better control of intrarow weeds. Supporting these tools with ecologically based management practices guided by weed biology knowledge and focused on reducing the seedbank, enhancing crop–weed interference, and managing dispersal will provide durable weed management recommendations for organic farming.</Para>

          <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
          <Para>To minimize loss of crop yield and quality, organic farmers replace herbicides with cultivation. This input substitution maintains focus on the seedling stage of weeds. Efficacy, however, is generally lower for cultivation relative to herbicide application, and as a consequence, weed pressure, that is, weed seedbanks, increase. Albrecht followed a farm in southern Germany through the transition from conventional to organic production [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. During the first 3 years after conversion, total seed numbers in soil increased from 4,000 to more than 17,000 m<Superscript>−2</Superscript>. These seedbank densities would be considered high on a conventional farm. For example, in the central USA “Corn Belt,” a low initial seedbank (i.e., &lt; 100 seeds m<Superscript>−2</Superscript>) resulted in too few seedlings to warrant control. Seedbanks<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Seedbank dynamics</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> ranging from 100 to 1,000 seeds m<Superscript>−2</Superscript> produced seedling populations that could be controlled by cultivation alone; there were high seedling populations where seedbanks were greater than 1,000 seeds m<Superscript>−2</Superscript> and cultivation alone could not prevent large yield losses<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Yield losses</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. Unfortunately, many organic farmers far exceed this seedbank threshold<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Threshold</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>.</Para>
          <Para>Seedbank data from an organic, diversified vegetable operation in Dixmont, ME, USA, demonstrate the challenging situation facing many such growers: a mean germinable seedbank nearing 25,000 seeds per m<Superscript>−2</Superscript> to 10-cm soil depth, with an average of 14.6 species (Gallandt, unpublished). The top four species included hairy galinsoga (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Galinsoga quadriradiata</Emphasis> Cav.), common lamb’s-quarters (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Chenopodium album</Emphasis> L.), redroot pigweed (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Amaranthus retroflexus</Emphasis> L.), and common purslane (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Portulaca oleracea</Emphasis> L.), all considered difficult-to-manage species. This farmer’s situation is not unique. In a recent survey of weed seedbanks<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Seedbank dynamics</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> on 23 organic farms in northern New England, USA, mostly diversified vegetable farms, germinable weed seed densities ranged from 2,500 to 25,000 seeds m<Superscript>−2</Superscript> (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">4.1</InternalRef>) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Eight of the 23 farms averaged more than 10,000 seeds m<Superscript>−2</Superscript>, which would be considered heavy weed pressure.</Para>

          <Para>What are the options for a farmer with very high weed densities? One option is to increase cultivation efficacy, but this is easier said than done. Cultivation tools vary in their efficacy based on soil conditions, weed species and growth stage, and operator skill. With practice, trial and error, and perhaps training<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Training</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> by an “expert” cultivator, farmers may improve their own skills, and thus efficacy. Alternatively, the simplest solution is to accept the inherent limitations of cultivation, perhaps invest in additional tools and labor, and increase the number of cultivation events. Although cultivating more is an easy solution, it may not be compatible with goals related to fuel economy or soil quality improvement. A second option is to decrease the initial weed seedling density. Cultivation efficacy of 70 %, a typical value for a tine harrow, may be perfectly acceptable for an initial weed density of 10 seedlings m<Superscript>−2</Superscript>, whereas an initial density of 100 seedlings m<Superscript>−2</Superscript> would require two passes to achieve the same result. Reducing the initial weed seedling density, in turn, requires a reduction in the germinable weed seedbank<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Para>“Critical-weed-free-period” managers need to focus only on weed seedlings and cultivation tools. Their aim is simply to reduce weed density as much as possible, for as long as practical or affordable, and then rely on crop competition for subsequent weed control. However, as growers shift their management from seedling focus and the short term—toward a longer time horizon and an explicit goal of improving weed management over time—they require increasingly detailed knowledge of weed biology and ecological principles to guide their management<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Knowledge</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>.</Para>
          <Para>Three important areas of seedbank ecology are particularly useful in this regard: (1) temporal patterns of weed emergence, (2) temporal patterns of weed seed rain, and (3) seed persistence in the soil, i.e., “half-lives.” Emergence periodicity is essential information to direct timing of fallow events deployed to stimulate germination thereby depleting the seedbank<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Seedbank dynamics</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> (see section “Seedbank management,” Maximizing Debits). Seed rain periodicity can guide deployment of short-season cash or cover crops<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Cover crop</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> that are terminated prior to weed seed rain. The duration of seed rain remains a priority research topic [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>].</Para>
          <Para>While annual weeds<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Annual weeds</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> are known for extreme longevity in the soil, with <Emphasis Type="Italic">some</Emphasis> seeds persisting for years or even decades, seed densities generally decline exponentially and, thus, <Emphasis Type="Italic">most</Emphasis> seeds are relatively short-lived in the soil. For this reason, half-lives better describe weed survival [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. In a review of 20 weed species conducted by Roberts and Feast [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>], in cultivated soil, only two species had seed half-lives &gt; 2 years: black medic (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Medicago lupulina</Emphasis> L.) and annual bluegrass (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Poa annua</Emphasis> L.). Mean half-life for the 18 reported species was 1.38 years. Thus, species will vary in their response to seedbank<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Seedbank dynamics</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> management; species with short half-lives will be particularly responsive.</Para>
          <Para>Organic farmers are increasingly requesting species-specific information as they work to manage emerging problems or weeds that are escaping other environmental and management stresses. Although most weed species have a considerable presence in the literature, rarely is weed biology information explicitly linked to practical management problems—a critical task for applied weed ecologists [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>].</Para>

            </IndexTerm> resides at the highest level of farm organization and is the foundation on which an ecologically based weed management<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Ecologically based weed management</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> program can be built. Here, cash and cover crops are chosen thereby defining the temporal sequence of management and disturbance “filters” that will contribute to the control of certain weed species and proliferation of others [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. In fact, crop rotation is a required practice in the US National Organic Program (§ 205.205): “The producer must implement a crop rotation including but not limited to sod, cover crops<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Cover crop</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, green manure crops, and catch crops that provide the following functions: (a) maintain or improve soil organic matter content; (b) provide pest management in annual and perennial crops; (c) manage deficient or excess plant nutrients; and (d) provide erosion control” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>].</Para>
          <Para>From a weed management perspective, crop sequences should arrange dissimilar species with temporally varying disturbance regimes to challenge weeds at multiple points in their life history, and individual crops managed to preempt resource capture by weeds [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. Over time, diverse cropping systems deploy a great variety of disturbance factors, including tillage<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Tillage</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, cultivation, crop competition, termination, and crop harvest. This can be the source of the multiple stresses or “Many Little Hammers” that are fundamental to ecologically based weed management<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Ecologically based weed management</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. Cover crops are often an important source of additional crop diversity, especially an opportunity to include sod crops and legumes on cash grain or vegetable farms lacking livestock.</Para>
          <Para>Anderson recently proposed a 9-year crop rotation sequence for organic production in the semiarid Great Plains of the USA, including perennial forages, cool- and warm-season annual crops, and intervals of no-till to stress annual weeds<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Annual weeds</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> at multiple points in their life history. The sequence included 3 years of alfalfa, two warm-season crops (corn, soybean), two cool-season crops (oat/pea, winter wheat), and again two warm-season crops (soybean, corn) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]. Notable in this design is the stacking of the warm- and cool-season crops in contrast to an alternating sequence. The 2-year interval exploited the relatively short half-life of downy brome (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Bromus tectorum</Emphasis> L.) seeds in the soil, consistently providing lower weed densities than an alternate year sequence, and matching the weed control achieved in a comparatively less productive winter wheat/fallow system [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Wheat</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. In a model exploring crop rotation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm> effects on a depth-structured population of spotted lady’s thumb (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Polygonum persicaria</Emphasis>), Mertens et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>] likewise found important sequence effects in a simple two-crop rotation, with lower populations in a rotation of crop sequence AABB compared to ABAB. Here, the effect was attributed not to seed survival but to tillage<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Tillage</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> effects on the seedbank<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Seedbank dynamics</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, establishment probability, and resultant fecundity. Expert organic farmers in the northeast USA frequently use particular short crop sequences or couplets to address multiple rotation goals including weed management; long-term, fixed sequences of crops are comparatively less common [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>].</Para>
          <Para>Mohler offered seven principles to guide crop rotation in diversified organic vegetable systems (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">4.1</InternalRef>) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. Foremost, and perhaps applicable only in high-value cropping systems, is the inclusion of clean fallow periods to deplete perennial below-ground reserves and to stimulate germination and establishment of annual weeds<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Annual weeds</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> thereby depleting the seedbank [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. This strategy, combined with intensive cover cropping<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Cover cropping</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, has proven pivotal to the Nordell’s weed management program [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>] (described later). Together, these seven recommendations reflect the core goals related to managing weed seedbanks: Maximize seed losses through timely fallowing to encourage germination and minimize seed inputs, and use short-season crops or crops planted in different seasons to preempt weed seed rain.</Para>

Field experiments conducted in Maine and Pennsylvania, USA, examined the seedbank-depleting effects of several full-season cover cropping treatments [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>]. Synthetic weed seedbanks were established in the fall or late winter. The following spring, cover crop treatments were established: oat/red clover; oat/pea, rye/hairy vetch; green bean, rye/hairy vetch; mustard, buckwheat, winter rape; and a summer fallow control. The incorporated green manure crops are well known for their allelopathic, residue-mediated effects on weeds [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>]. Despite these established mechanisms, the main factor responsible for large and consistent seedbank losses was tillage. The soil disturbance events associated with cover crop management stimulated germination; subsequent disturbance events killed these weeds and prevented weed seed rain.

            <Heading>Organic “No-Till”</Heading>
            <Para>Organic systems are frequently criticized for reliance on tillage and cultivation for residue management, seedbed preparation, and weed control. Conservation tillage, no-till in particular, offers well-known improvements to soil quality, but generally relies extensively on herbicides, both preplanting to burn down weeds and crop volunteers, and postemergence to control weeds within the crop. In recent years, research teams in several regions have challenged the assumption that no-till systems require herbicides, aiming to bring the soil-improving benefits to organic systems [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>]. Generally, these systems have relied on high-residue cultivation equipment to maintain physical weed control, or the use of mowed or rolled/crimped cover crops in an attempt to establish weed-suppressive mulch. While the ecosystem services of organic grain production are compelling, particularly soil quality benefits of organic no-till [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>], there are considerable challenges in managing weeds [<CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para>In the southeastern USA, rolled/crimped rye has shown some promise in organic no-till soybean, but weed control was highly dependent on the amount of rye biomass, and unfortunately, high levels of rye biomass were related to excessive soybean lodging [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>]. In the mid-Atlantic USA, rolled/crimped cover cropping<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Cover cropping</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> systems have been the focus of considerable attention in the past decade. Fall-sown cereal rye and rye/hairy vetch intercrops, terminated by rolling–crimping the following spring, provided variable weed control largely depending on the timing of cover crop planting, termination, and timing of weed emergence [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>]. Again, the challenge is producing sufficient cover crop biomass to establish thick, dense mulch that provides season-long weed suppression. Density of the cover crop may also be an important factor, contributing to greater ground cover in early spring [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para>As common with many ecological approaches to weed management, variability in mulch<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Mulch</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> crops has proven a problem for these systems. One tool to manage this uncertainty is a decision aid that would enable farmers to change to a clean-till system when overwintering cover crop biomass is likely to be insufficient [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>]. Routine use of additional ecological weed management tactics may also help make mulch-based systems more reliable. Ryan et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>] found that elevated soybean seeding rates could compensate for lower cereal rye biomass levels; however, seeding rate effects were inconsistent over years when tested alone. A common problem, however, with elevated seeding rates in organic systems is the high cost of organic seed.</Para>
            <Para>In the more arid cropping region of the US northern Great Plains, such mulch-based systems have proven to have many problems: excessive water use by cover crops, insufficient nitrogen contribution, termination dates incongruent with cash crop sowing dates, and weed control—perennial weeds in particular [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>]. In western Canada, rolling–crimping and mowing were effective alternatives to tillage for the termination of legume green manures, and a rotary hoe designed for minimum tillage<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The Nordells wanted to farm without outside labor, which would require very low weed pressure. They also wanted to rely upon on-farm resources, which would mean no purchased mulch. They started farming the old hay fields of their current farm in 1983, immediately battling a heavy infestation of quack grass (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Elytrigia repens</Emphasis> L.) by summer fallowing. Early on, they spent a lot of time speaking with older local dairy farmers who told of the time-tested “COWS” (<Emphasis Type="Italic">c</Emphasis>orn, <Emphasis Type="Italic">o</Emphasis>at, <Emphasis Type="Italic">w</Emphasis>heat, and <Emphasis Type="Italic">s</Emphasis>od) rotation that was common to the region in the pre-herbicide era.

We realized early on that if we prevented weeds from going to seed, it would reduce our weed seed banks and labor spent in weeding.” This was according to Paul and Sandy Arnold, Pleasant Valley Farm, Argyle, NY, USA. They manage several acres of organic hay for mulch in addition to their vegetable production. A modified forage harvester chops the mulch<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Mulch</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> into a self-unloading wagon that is driven through the vegetable field depositing a windrow of green mulch. This is then spread, using pitchforks and by hand, to place a 15–20-cm deep layer of mulch around and between transplants. No hand weeding<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Weeding</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> is subsequently required and soil organic matter increased from the original of 1–2 % to 3.5–4.0 %.</Para>
            <Para>Harvesting is the largest labor expense on the farm. “Good weed control also increases harvest efficiency, yields, and everyone’s morale; we enjoy working on a farm that everyone can be proud of in terms of organization and visual appearance.” The intensive mulching system used by the Arnolds is congruent with two guiding rules regarding management of the farm: First is the “US$ 10,000 per acre rule,” i.e., each crop is expected to have a minimum gross value of US$ 10,000 per acre. Second is the “US$ 30 per h rule,” which means that each employee, while picking and packing for market, must be earning a minimum US$ 30 per h for the farm [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>]. In this context, the early-season investment in intensive mulching<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Mulching\t See also Mulch</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> means that morale remains high and employees are never asked to spend a day “heroic weeding.” For the remainder of the season, employees focus on picking, washing, packing, and marketing. The mulch clearly represents considerable early investment in labor, but depreciated over the season, and importantly, the benefit to soil quality has made this strategy central to the success of this farm.</Para>

There is an inherent trade-off between yield gains due to reductions in weed density from blind cultivation, and yield loss due to crop damage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR42">42</CitationRef>]. As weed seedlings grow beyond the sensitive “white thread” stage, these implements must be adjusted or operated more aggressively to maintain even moderate efficacy, thereby causing even greater crop damage. Organic growers and their advisors would be wise in establishing control strips to evaluate the cost/benefit of blind cultivation as the negative effects on crop yields are often ignored<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Finger and torsion weeders offer improved intrarow weed control compared to harrowing, but require accurate steering or precision guidance and thus have relatively low working rates. Nevertheless, these intrarow tools reduced hand weeding by 40–70 % [<CitationRef CitationID="CR45">45</CitationRef>]. Other innovative weeding implements from Europe include the Pneumat® weeder, which uses compressed air to blow small weed seedlings out of the crop row, and several nonselective tools that rely on real-time crop sensing to move an implement between crop plants that are widely spaced within the row.

A comprehensive weed management plan focused on reducing the weed seedbank will result in both improved weeding outcomes with the use of hand tools and lower hand weeding costs<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Para>Hand weeding may rely on pushed, wheeled tools, long-handled tools, short-handled tools, and/or hand pulling. We conducted eight field experiments, measuring working rate (i.e., row-feet weeded per minute) and efficacy (i.e., proportion of weeds controlled) in a standardized crop/surrogate weed system of corn and condiment mustard (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Sinapis alba,</Emphasis> “Idagold”) (Gallandt, unpublished). Wheeled tools generally had highest working rates, but occasionally lower efficacy than other tools or hand pulling. Importantly, working rates for wheeled tools were independent of weed density. Thus, wheeled tools should be used before other hand methods because of their higher working rates. Long-handled tools may offer improved efficacy over wheeled tools, but generally with lower working rates. Short-handled tools and hand pulling offer potentially complete weed control, but with increasing time proportional to weed density. Overall, wheeled tools should be the first step in a hand weeding<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Weeding</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> program, followed by long- and then short-handled tools, with hand pulling a final step where very high efficacy is required.</Para>
          <Para>Qualitative surveys of hand tools indicated a high level of variation in user preference (Gallandt, unpublished). The Glaser® stirrup hoe was top-ranked in aggregate user scores for categories of “feel,” “efficacy,” and “overall,” followed closely by the Glaser® wheel hoe. Contrary to expectations, tool rankings were, with a few minor exceptions, generally unaffected by gender, age, years of experience, or scale of enterprise (Gallandt, unpublished).</Para>
          <Para>While research and development efforts strive to enhance efficacy of future tools, it is possible to overcome rather low efficacy through repeated use of existing tools. This may be necessary due to low efficacy and an abundant seedling population, and/or due to protracted establishment patterns of particular species. An example of this is the recently published work of Peruzzi et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">46</CitationRef>], in the Fucino plateau area of Italy. In organic carrots, their strategy was to reduce the initial weed population with a false seedbed (or stale seedbed)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Stale seedbed</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>; subsequently flame; precision hoe; and hand weed. This example demonstrates the need to reduce the germinable seedbank. Although the authors did not quantify the germinable seedbank, the site clearly required multiple physical weed control passes to bring the population down to an acceptable level. Despite reduction in initial seedling density achieved with false seedbed, subsequent flushes of weeds were generally very high, requiring repeated interventions<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Heading>Seedbank Management</Heading>
          <Para>Researchers have concluded that relatively low and variable efficacy of alternative weed management practices requires additional efforts to reduce weed seedbanks [<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">47</CitationRef>], a conclusion further supported by simulation models [<CitationRef CitationID="CR48">48</CitationRef>]. Direct weed control measures (e.g., herbicides) provide density-independent weed seedling control [<CitationRef CitationID="CR49">49</CitationRef>]. Thus, the density of surviving weeds is simply a proportion of the initial density. This holds true for cultivation, (Gallandt, unpublished), at least at reasonable weed densities; at exceptionally high densities of selected species, one could imagine inverse density-dependent effects, e.g., a “sod” of large crabgrass (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Digitaria sanguinalis</Emphasis> l.) seedlings may experience reduced mortality as the seedlings are less likely to be dislodged from soil and desiccate. There are at least three solutions to the problem of density-independent efficacy: (1) simply cultivate more, adding additional cultivation events proportional to the initial weed density; (2) cultivate better, by improving the operator’s skill in decision making, timing, adjustment, or investment in weeding<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Both groups seemingly shared the conceptual model of seeds entering the seedbank and subsequently declining. However, experts focused on the initial rapid decline of the seedbank, inspired by ecologically based opportunities for management (e.g., [<CitationRef CitationID="CR51">51</CitationRef>]), whereas farmers expressed a less optimistic perspective, focusing on the protracted “tail” of the seed decay<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

This incongruity in such a pivotal point for ecological weed management is an opportunity for improved educational programming and applied research.

We expected to see higher germinable weed seedbank densities within exclosures where seeds were protected from predators. In the first year of the study, there were 42 % fewer germinable weed seeds outside the exclosures, evidence of a large and significant effect of predators over the fall, winter, and spring assay periods (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">4.2</InternalRef>). However, in 2 subsequent years, we did not detect an exclosure effect. Thus, although predation rates may be impressive in certain years, the high level of interannual variation suggests that predation may not be a reliable seedbank debiting mechanism.</Para>

Thus, in a related set of experiments, we examined weed seedbank response to four fall weed management strategies, some designed to retain weed seeds for as long as possible at the soil surface. Surprisingly, seeds do not simply stay at the soil surface, but are buried even in the absence of tillage<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Zero seed rain, a control, we included in this study, consistently had the smallest seedbank (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">4.6</InternalRef>). Treatments designed to retain weed seeds on the soil surface thereby increasing opportunity for predation losses—i.e., mowing alone, or mowing with a no-till cover crop—offered no advantage over the fall tillage, cover cropped treatment, despite the weed seed burial and protection from predators expected with this treatment (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">4.6</InternalRef>).</Para>

            <Para>Inspired by increasingly intractable problems with multiple herbicide resistance in annual ryegrass (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Lolium rigidum</Emphasis> Gaudin), Australian farmers and researchers are developing innovative technologies for weed management. The Harrington Seed Destroyer, for example, is a device that mills grain chaff and weed seeds exiting a combine, resulting in &gt; 95 % weed seed mortality [<CitationRef CitationID="CR67">67</CitationRef>]. Chaff carts, narrow windrow burning<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>, and bale direct are additional practices being used, or developed, to address the herbicide resistance problem in Australia [<CitationRef CitationID="CR68">68</CitationRef>]. These techniques could benefit organic grain systems in locations where the predominant weeds are species that retain their seeds when mature, and species that have relatively short-lived seedbanks, e.g., &lt; 1 year.</Para>
            <Para>Davis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR69">69</CitationRef>] conducted a thorough analysis of fall weed seed pools in east-central Illinois, USA, in conventionally managed corn and soybean. The seed pools included seed that was undispersed, recently dispersed, collected by machinery, and previously dispersed. In one or more crops during the 2 experimental years, the ratio of undispersed seeds to seeds in the seedbank was &gt; 1, indicating the complete seedbank replenishment. Although many species dispersed seed prior to harvest, ivyleaf morningglory (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Ipomoea hederacea</Emphasis> L.), giant foxtail (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Setaria faberi</Emphasis> Herrm.), and prickly sida (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Sida spinosa</Emphasis> L.) retained more than 50 % of new seeds on the mother plant, providing an opportunity for mechanical seed capture.</Para>

                <Primary>Flaming</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> is commonly used on organic and low-external-input farms to control weed seedlings, especially annual dicots in slow-to-emerge crops, such as carrot and beet. Field studies conducted at the Goranson Farm, Dresden, ME, USA, demonstrated that pre-dispersal flaming did not affect viability of common lamb’s-quarters or redroot pigweed seeds (Gallandt, unpublished). Flaming, however, showed promise as a method to reduce density of weed seeds following dispersal. Greenhouse and field studies demonstrated that flaming could kill weed seeds on the soil surface (Gallandt, unpublished). Typical tractor speeds used for other flaming operations (e.g., 2.6 km h<Superscript>−1</Superscript>) killed about 50 % of the most sensitive species (i.e., hairy galinsoga); however, with the flame dosage doubled (i.e., to 1.3 km h<Superscript>−1</Superscript>) flaming reliably killed 75 % or more seeds of mustard, large crabgrass, and hairy galinsoga. Flaming effects on redroot pigweed were visually very striking (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig7">4.7</InternalRef>). There was no advantage to further doubling the flaming dosage, as seed mortality was similar to both 1.3 and 0.6 km h<Superscript>−1</Superscript> treatments. With an estimated cost of US$ 375 ha<Superscript>−1</Superscript> for 1.3 km h<Superscript>−1</Superscript> treatment, fall flaming could prevent large weed seedbank credits, especially of relatively sensitive species, including hairy galinsoga.</Para>

However, experiments conducted with wild oat (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Avena fatua</Emphasis> L.) in long-term conservation-tillage and no-till plots, managed conventionally, indicated that decay and overall seed mortality was similar in the contrasting tillage<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Common lamb’s-quarters and smooth pigweed (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Amaranthus hybridus</Emphasis> L.) were buried in mesh bags, in both organic and conventional cropping systems. Management system effects on seed mortality were inconsistent, as were relationships between soil microbial biomass and seed mortality. In another study conducted near Presque Isle, ME, USA, a similar mesh bag study characterized fall, overwinter, and spring mortality of six weed species in long-term replicated plots managed for divergent soil quality characteristics; there was no evidence of a soil quality effect on seed mortality (Gallandt, unpublished). There is, in fact, evidence that organic amendments may actually inhibit seed mortality [<CitationRef CitationID="CR74">74</CitationRef>]<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm> requires diversity. The most important tools in this regard are cash or cover crops with opportunities for high levels of weed control and varying disturbance regimes, which can preempt weed seed production and encourage seedbank depletion. The disintegration of crop and livestock production characterizes the modern farming system, and limits the potential internal biological controls likely to be essential to the development of whole-farm, systemic resistance to weeds. Animals per se are probably not requisite, the manure, compost, and crop diversification—sod crops, winter and spring cereals, and legumes—may be the elements required to satisfactorily manage weeds on organic farms. Supporting this contention, crop rotation and cover cropping<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Cover cropping</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> are top-ranked weed management practices noted by organic farmers, practices offering such diversification. However, these practices often do not contribute to weed management goals, and may actually hinder long-term progress in reducing the weed seedbank if they permit abundant weed seed rain. Similarly, cover crops are frequently noted as “competitive” and “weed-suppressive,” but they may offer few benefits if associated disturbance events do not prevent weed seed inputs.</Para>

              <Primary>Organic farming</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> systems. There is broad consensus in the research community that successful weed management without herbicides requires a systems perspective, a combination of control measures and greater system complexity that aims to compensate for generally moderate reliability and efficacy of any individual practice [<CitationRef CitationID="CR75">75</CitationRef>]. There are farmers who embrace such complexity and share researchers’ fascination for the ecology of complex systems. However, it is important to note that weeds, while an important problem for organic farmers, are only one of their many problems, and many farmers desire the simplest solution they can find. This, perhaps, explains the continued emphasis on cultivation and managing for the critical weed-free period. Facing an increasing weed problem, the simple solution is to cultivate more. Farmers of varying scales and enterprises manage very successful enterprises using this approach, despite criticism from researchers regarding possible deterioration of soil quality, risk, and labor costs.</Para>
          <Para>There are considerable management costs, investment in education, scouting, and trial and error associated with complex, ecologically based, “Many Little Hammers” approaches to weed management. It is perhaps not surprising that adoption is slow. Bastiaans et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR75">75</CitationRef>] recommend that, in addition to continued development of additional practices, ecological weed management strategies require clear and quantitative evidence of efficacy, variability, and cost–benefit. Expert farmer testimonials currently provide some of this evidence and simulation models additional support [<CitationRef CitationID="CR64">64</CitationRef>].</Para>
