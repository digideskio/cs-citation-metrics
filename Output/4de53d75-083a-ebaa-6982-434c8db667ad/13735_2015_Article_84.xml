              <Para ID="Par1">Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is the process of searching digital images in a large database based on features, such as color, texture and shape of a given query image. As many images are compressed by transforms, constructing the feature vector directly in transform domain is a very popular topic. Therefore, features can be extracted directly from images in compressed format by using, for example, discrete cosine transform (DCT) for JPEG compressed images. Also, region-based image retrieval (RBIR) has attracted great interest in recent years. This paper proposes a new RBIR approach using shape-adaptive discrete cosine transform (SA-DCT). In this retrieval system, an image has a prior segmentation alpha plane, which is defined exactly as in MPEG-4. Therefore, an image is represented by segmented regions, each of which is associated with a feature vector derived from DCT and SA-DCT coefficients. Users can select any region as the main theme of the query image. The similarity between a query image and any database image is ranked according to a same similarity measure computed from the selected regions between two images. For those images without distinctive objects and scenes, users can still select the whole image as the query condition. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to identify main objects and reduce the influence of background in the image, and thus improve the performance of image retrieval in comparison with a conventional CBIR based on DCT.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par2">Widespread use of digital imaging devices in various areas of application has resulted in large volumes of images acquired and stored on computers. Effective and efficient retrieval of images stored in such large databases has become desirable. Comparing to the conventional retrieval using descriptive keywords, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) offers a way of retrieving images according to their visual content [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. After two decades of research, it is acknowledged that the performance of CBIR systems is mainly limited by the gap between low-level features and high-level semantic concepts [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. Unlike early CBIR approaches, which compute global features of images, the region-based image retrieval (RBIR) extract features of the segmented regions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>] and perform similarity comparisons at the granularity of the region [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. The CBIR systems often used global features to represent the content of an image [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. If the images contain no obvious objects, the global feature-based approaches proved to be successful in describing the image content. However, for images with salient objects, using global features leads to inaccurate content descriptions. In order to solve this problem, RBIR systems are researched and developed [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. These systems applies image segmentation to decompose an image into regions to enhance the ability of capturing as well as representing the focus of the user’s perceptions of image content [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]. The RBIR systems attempted to overcome the limitation of global-based retrieval systems by emphasizing the target objects and minimizing the influence of background. During retrieval, the user is provided with segmented regions of the query image and is required to assign several properties, such as the regions to be matched, the features of the regions, and even the weights of different features [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. The matching of the regions is restricted to be one-to-one, i.e., one region of an image can only match one region of another image or image by image [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>], i.e., many region to many region [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. However, semantically precise image segmentation is still an open problem [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par3">For compressed images, features can be extracted directly from images in their JPEG compressed format [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>] by using, for example, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) which is a part of compression process [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>]. Recently, there were numerous approaches based on using the DCT block processed images for information extraction [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>]. The improvement in using DCT is explained by its decorrelation properties, feature preservation and reduction in complexity. It means that much of the energy lies in low frequency coefficients, so that high frequency can be discarded without visible distortion. It is evident that the use of DCT block transformation in combination with other techniques results in good retrieval performance. In most cases DCT can be seen as a preprocessing step followed by a more or less sophisticated method for extracting structural features. It has been shown in some cases that the DCT based processing gives significantly better retrieval results than direct pixel based processing [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par4">In early CBIR which uses the DCT blocks [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>], the boundary blocks contain pixels from an object and either from background or from another object (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>). Thus, region-based retrieval is not possible. Also, the retrieval quality may suffer since pixels on different sides of the boundary may have different characteristics; by applying the standard DCT to such a block, spectral properties of these pixels are mixed up making the search for a good object retrieval unreliable. In particular, a sharp intensity transition will cause significant spectral oscillations. To develop their RBIR system, Liu and Zhang [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>] have used Projection On Convex Sets (POCS) in the wavelet domain by using Gabor filters [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>]. Recently, Zhang et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>] have also proposed to apply Curvelet transform to an arbitrarily shaped object for RBIR. In this paper, we propose to apply SA-DCT [<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>], which is a part of the compression process in the MPEG-4 standards [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>], that takes into account prior segmentation of the image into regions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par5">The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec2">2</InternalRef>, we briefly review the theory of CBIR in the DCT domain. In Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec6">3</InternalRef>, we make a problem statement, the Shape-adaptive DCT transform is described and the proposed RBIR system is presented. In Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec11">4</InternalRef> numerous experimental results are shown and the robustness of our system is proved whereas in Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec18">5</InternalRef> we draw conclusions.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

                  </InlineEquation> DCT block, selects 9 coefficients out of all 15 AC coefficients in each block and uses their statistical information to construct the AC-pattern. A new problem could occur from the fact that various DCT blocks sizes have been used in different compression standards like JPEG and MPEG. Jiang and Feng [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>] have proposed the spatial relationship of DCT coefficients between a block and its sub-blocks, to deal with inter-transfer of DCT coefficients from different blocks with various sizes. Our selection gathers 9 coefficients into 3 groups: Horizontal (Group H), Vertical (Group V) and diagonal (Group D) as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>. For each group, the sum of the coefficients is calculated firstly and then the squared differences between each coefficient and the sum of this group are calculated. Finally, these squared-differences of the three groups are used to construct the AC-Pattern. This selection is retained because of its ability to represent local structure of content block [<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>]. Compared with the method of [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>] which uses 15 AC-Pattern, this selection can reduce the complexity of the feature vector obviously. The histograms of feature vectors based on the coefficients of quantized block transforms are used for the description of global statistical information. Histograms are relevant since they are based only on the overall statistics and no structural information about the location of features is considered [<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef>]. Moreover, the variability in image sizes influences the number of occurrences of the patterns. Therefore, a normalization of the resulted histograms is mandatory. Since histograms are normalized, they can also be regarded as describing probability of features, and also as vectors with unit length. The idea of the proposed technique of histogram generation is based on the approach used in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>]. The histogram of the whole database is generated to produce a reference histogram from which we calculate decision levels that enable us to generate descriptors. Commonly and particularly in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>], histogram descriptors are designed by simply uniformly quantizing the feature of interest (the DCT coefficients) and then counting the number of elements having the same value and then taking the number of desired bins. This approach has proved to provide efficient results. The proposed technique is borrowed from image coding where histogram equalization is applied. In image coding, it is shown that this adaptive quantization can help to reduce the bit rate and to enhance signal-to-noise ratio. Starting from this observation, we propose to design the histogram-based descriptor by defining the histogram bins like in the case of adaptive quantization. First, the reference histogram of the database is generated and normalized to sum to the unity. Then the adaptive quantization is designed such a way that the “probability” to get a value between any two consecutive decision levels is equal. Knowing the desired number K of bins, this probability equals <InlineEquation ID="IEq23">

                  </InlineEquation>. This enables to generate decision levels that are then used to define the descriptor for the query. Finally, for each individual histogram, use the generated decision levels and sum up the bins between two consecutive levels. This leads to the descriptor for the image under study. From the original histogram of AC-Pattern (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>), we can make two observations: the first is that there is only part of AC-Patterns that appear in large quantities and a large number of AC-Patterns that appear rarely [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>]. So in consideration of time-consuming and efficiency, we just select some of AC-Patterns which have higher frequency to construct the histogram. For constructing the AC-Pattern histogram of an image, we just calculate the number of appearance of these AC-Patterns in this image, and then we get the AC-Pattern histogram <InlineEquation ID="IEq24">

                  </Equation>The feature histograms can be seen as normalized vectors. This allow comparing statistical information of images in quantitative way by calculating the distance between the histograms under suitable norm. Many distances have been used to define the similarity of two color histogram representations [<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">39</CitationRef>]. In our system, the similarity between query and images in the database is assessed by the Chi-Squared distance [Eq. (<InternalRef RefID="Equ3">3</InternalRef>)] between these corresponding feature descriptor. The Chi-Square test is used to compare two binned data sets and to determine if they are drawn from the same distribution function.<Equation ID="Equ3">

              <Heading>Problem statement and related work</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par11">A number of image search engines have been developed. We cannot survey all related work in the allocated space. Instead, we try to emphasize some of the work that is most related to our work. Early CBIR systems in the compressed domain use global features, like DCT coefficients histograms [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>] to represent images. They have used the histograms to provide information about the distribution of features, without any information about locations of features. These global features are extracted from entire images and often fail to capture local details that exist in most natural images. As a consequence, dissimilar images varying in local details have similar feature vector representations. This anomaly creates difficulties for global representations to have direct relations with image semantics. Also, Zhong and Defee [<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef>] have proposed a framework for the unification of statistical and structural information for pattern retrieval. They incorporate structural information description for patterns by considering decomposition of patterns into <Emphasis Type="Italic">rectangular subareas</Emphasis>. The similarity between images is then determined by comparing the signatures of subimages. An obvious drawback of the system is the sharply increased computational complexity and increase of size of the search space due to exhaustive generation of subimages.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par12">In our approach, to address this problem, we follow the techniques that divide images into semantics regions with a hope that a region level representation would capture local details. These techniques are formally known as RBIR techniques. Almost all region-based techniques work in the same way—divide images into regions and represent them in terms region features.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par13">In the classical CBIR (Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec2">2</InternalRef>), the blocks are defined independently of image content. The boundary blocks contain pixels from an object and either from background or from another object (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>). Thus, independent retrieving of objects is not possible. Also, the retrieval quality may suffer since pixels on different sides of the boundary may have different characteristics; by applying the standard DCT to such a block, spectral properties of these pixels are mixed up making the search for a good region-to-region correspondence unreliable. In particular, a sharp intensity transition will cause significant spectral oscillations. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new approach to RBIR that takes into account prior segmentation of the image into regions so as to perform similarity comparisons at the granularity of the region independently of others regions (or from background). This allows independent retrieval of individual regions, thus permitting new functionalities.</Para>

POCS algorithm is the iterative technique and the iterative process is terminated when the pixels outside the boundary converge. The algorithm can be described by the following steps:<OrderedList>

This means that the selection of coefficients to be retained is highly dependent on the initial extrapolation; large high-frequency components may be produced by an unsuitable extrapolation, and thus may result in a suboptimal zone for coefficients to be retained. In [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>], they use Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) instead of DCT. In Region-Based image compression, Stasinski and Konrad [<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef>] have shown a great performances of the shape-adaptive DCT in comparison with POCS.</Para>

Firstly, the system segments every image into two regions: Foreground (the main object) and Background, and then extracts low-level texture features of each region by using DCT and SA-DCT. Once features are extracted, we design two different systems to check the retrieval effectiveness. These two systems differ in query formulation and image distance calculation. The first system uses query by region of interest like Blobworld [<CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>]. We name this <Emphasis Type="Italic">Single Region Query Based Technique</Emphasis>. The distance between the query and a database image is the minimum of distances between the query region and all regions of the database image.

The basic concept of the SA-DCT is to perform vertical 1-D DCTs on the active pixels first, and then to apply horizontal DCTs to the vertical DCT coefficients with the same frequency index. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig8">8</InternalRef> illustrates the procedure. The final coefficients of the SA-DCT are located in the upper-left corner of each block. The number of the SA-DCT coefficients is identical to the number of active pixels. Since the shape of each segment is stored, the retrieval system can perform the inverse SA-DCT. The most important benefit of SA-DCT is its capability to adapt to arbitrarily shaped regions; the method falls back to standard DCT on rectangular image blocks. The performance of SA-DCT is surprisingly high and closely approaches that of advanced methods based on basis orthogonalization [<CitationRef CitationID="CR49">49</CitationRef>]. Moreover, SA-DCT can be implemented in real-time [<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>] whereas the orthogonalization-based approaches are very demanding memory- and CPU-wise. Due to these properties, the SA-DCT algorithm has become a common tool for coding of arbitrarily shaped image regions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR51">51</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR52">52</CitationRef>] and, in particular, has been incorporated into MPEG-4 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>].

Then the performance can be evaluated by precision and recall. Precision indicates the retrieval accuracy and is defined as the ratio of the number of relevant retrieved images over the number of total retrieved images. Recall indicates the ability of retrieving relevant images from the database. It is defined as the ratio of the number of relevant retrieved images over the total number of relevant images in the database. Relevant images are referred to images in the same category. We have also used the mean average precision (MAP). It is the common way to transform P-R graph into one value. The Mean Average Precision over all queries is defined as<Equation ID="Equ6">

Ten categories of images are tested. The average Precision-Recall curves between our region-based approach (with mask) and the conventional content-based approach (without mask) are shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig10">10</InternalRef>. We have shown the categories “Flowers” Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig10">10</InternalRef>a. and “Elephants” Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig10">10</InternalRef>b, from Corel-1000 database, and the categories “Baseball-glove” Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig10">10</InternalRef>c and “Backpack” Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig10">10</InternalRef>d, from Caltech-256 database as the reference query images. The comparison of the average Precision-Recall results, on the Corel-1000 database, between the proposed Region-Based approach and the conventional Content-Based approach [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>] is shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig11">11</InternalRef>a. The same curves, for Caltech-256, are shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig11">11</InternalRef>b. The best performance is obtained by using the global combined descriptor [Eq. (<InternalRef RefID="Equ4">4</InternalRef>)] of the foreground and the background together. So, the proposed system attempts to overcome the limitation of global-based retrieval (CIBR with DCT only) systems by emphasizing the target objects and minimizing the influence of background.</Para>

Our RBIR(SADCT) outperforms all the others methods (RBIR and CBIR), also the RBIR(SADCT) works better than region-by-region matching.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig13">

                <Para ID="Par38">Equal error rate (EER) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR61">61</CitationRef>] is often used to evaluate the performance of face recognition algorithm. So considering a query image belonging to class A, two things could occur: on one hand, it could be recognized rightly; on the other hand, it could be falsely rejected from class A, then the ratio of how many images of class A are in this situation is called false rejected rate (FRR). In contrast, considering a query image out of class A, when it is compared with the images of class A, it could be rejected rightly or it could be falsely accepted as class A, so the ratio of how many images of other classes are in this situation is defined as false accept rate (FAR). When FRR and FAR take equal values, an equal error rate (EER) is got. The lower the EER is, the better is the performance of the system, as the total error rate is the sum of FAR and FRR. Finally, we use the descriptor of the AC-Patterns and DC-Patterns together to do face recognition. The weight parameter <InlineEquation ID="IEq62">

Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig15">15</InternalRef> illustrates the results on Corel-1000 and Caltech-256 databases. These subfigures in the first and the third colones of Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig15">15</InternalRef> show the changing rank of the target image in the retrieved images, and in the second and fourth colones the Chi-Distance Eq. (<InternalRef RefID="Equ3">3</InternalRef>) between altered images and target images as we increase the significance of image variations. It is illustrated in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig15">15</InternalRef> that as we increase brighten/darken percentage, size of Gaussian filter window and rotated angle to certain degree, the rank of the target image still be in a strong position and the distance between altered image and target image is still small. Therefore our system is robust with respect to different intensity variation, blur variation and rotation. Experimental results in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig16">16</InternalRef> demonstrate some query example.</Para>

We consider the classical retrieval scenario, in which the feature representation of all images in the database are calculated off-line and the feature representation of query image is calculated on the fly when the retrieval is executed. We measure the average running time of each query. In general, one second is needed to segment an image. Note that the running time of feature representation includes DCT and SA-DCT transformations, feature vector construction and histogram construction is about 36 s per image and it remains nearly stable. The matching speed is very fast. When the query image is in the database, it takes about 1 s of CPU time on average to sort all the images in the 1000 image database using the Chi-Distance similarity measure.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par41">Based on the conventional CBIR techniques in DCT domain, a new RBIR system based on SA-DCT is proposed to improve the retrieval accuracy. Consequently, one can retrieve a region without reference to information about other regions of the image. Clearly, this permits interesting operations such as object-based querying. Since an automatic computation of semantically meaningful object is extremely difficult, our approach, by exploiting a prior segmentation, can delegate the segmentation to sophisticated, high performance, and necessarily CPU-intensive algorithms that can be executed off-line. The proposed method has the power of capturing both local features and global features, and making use of both semantic features and low level features. The experimental results indicate its correctness and efficiency, and a compromise between high retrieval ratio and less complexity. In the future, we will enhance our technique for images which have more than two regions (objects). By constructing region importance index [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>], this will reduces the adverse effect of inaccurate segmentation.</Para>
