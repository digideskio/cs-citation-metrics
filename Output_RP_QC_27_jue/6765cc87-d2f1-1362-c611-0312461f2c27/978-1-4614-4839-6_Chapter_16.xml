Over more recent years, a secondary purpose of this type of insurance has developed, which is to protect employers from lawsuits by injured workers (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001632">Davis, n.d.</CitationRef>). In relationship to the history of workers’ compensation, vocational retraining is relatively new, originating in the “human investment” literature that rose to prominence in the 1960s (Mincer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016109">1962</CitationRef>).

              <Heading>Brief History of Workers’ Compensation</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">While workers’ compensation represents a relatively new phenomenon in the United States, Guyton (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001657">1999</CitationRef>) has noted that: “The history of compensation for bodily injury begins shortly after the advent of written history itself” (p. 106). Ancient Sumerian scriptures date monetary compensation for work-related injuries back to 2050 <Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">bc</Emphasis> (Kramer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001687">1958</CitationRef>), with the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Code of Hammurabi</Emphasis> in Mesopotamia dating similar compensation back to 1750 <Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">bc</Emphasis> (Smith, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016137">1931</CitationRef>). Additionally, Ancient Greek, Chinese, and Roman laws included sets of compensation schedules (Geerts, Kornblith, &amp; Urmson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001651">1977</CitationRef>), each of which specified circumscribed payments for losses of body parts. In the feudalistic Middle Ages, however, compensation for work-related injuries essentially disappeared, as indemnification was left to the arbitrary whims of feudal lords (Guyton, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001657">1999</CitationRef>). For many subsequent years, injured workers were left without appropriate protection, and needless suffering occurred due to this lack of oversight and regulation.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Modern workers’ compensation was pioneered in Germany in the 1870s and 1880s through autonomous industry insurance funds referred to as “<Emphasis Type="Italic">Berufsgenossenschaften</Emphasis>” (Clayton, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001627">1997</CitationRef>). This process was actually championed by the socially conservative Prussian Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, as a pragmatic move to neutralize the influence of the worker-friendly Marxist movement that was growing at the time (Perlin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016118">1985</CitationRef>). Although Britain enacted the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Employer’s Liability Act</Emphasis> as early as 1880, proof of employer negligence was still required in order for an injured worker to receive compensation. It was not until 1897 that Parliament passed a “no fault” doctrine (Hadler, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001661">1995</CitationRef>). In the United States, policies protecting injured workers came about more slowly. Although several States attempted to enact workers’ compensation laws as early as 1898, it was not until Congress passed the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Employers’ Liability Acts</Emphasis> of 1906 and 1908 that a genuine workers’ compensation program became effective. Unfortunately, these Acts covered only railroad workers involved in interstate commerce (Baker, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00166">1992</CitationRef>). In 1911, Wisconsin became the initial State to pass a comprehensive workers’ compensation law, and 36 other States followed suit by the end of the decade. Mississippi became the final state to pass workers’ compensation legislation in 1948 (Fishback &amp; Kantor, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001640">2000</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">At any given time, 10 % of the US work force is experiencing work disability due to industrial injury or illness (Weil, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016162">2001</CitationRef>). However, there exists considerable heterogeneity in workers’ compensation systems from State to State, including rates of work-related disability within workers’ compensation systems. Private insurance carriers are the largest provider of workers’ compensation policies, with all but four States—North Dakota, Ohio, Washington, and Wyoming—allowing ­private carriers to provide workers’ compensation benefits (Sengupta, Reno, &amp; Burton, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016135">2009</CitationRef>). Twenty-one States allow private carriers to provide workers’ compensation benefits, despite the availability of competing State-sponsored coverage. Some may consider such competition between the private ­sector and the government to be ideal, as it will theoretically foster efficacy and efficiency. The proportion of benefits for which competitive State funds account varies from a low of 5.4 % in South Carolina to a high of 59.5 % in Arizona. With the exception of North Dakota and Wyoming, which require all employers to obtain coverage through their State funds, all States allow employers to self-insure for workers’ compensation. The rates of self-insurance in States that allow it vary from a low of 13.3 % in Rhode Island to a high of 50.8 % in Alabama. All but five States allow for policies with deductibles. Shares of workers’ compensation benefits by type of insurer have also been found to vary considerably across the States (Sengupta et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016135">2009</CitationRef>). Complicating the situation in the United States is the continued federal workers’ compensation covering federal employees and coal miners diagnosed with black lung disease, longshore and harbor workers, employees of overseas contractors with the US government, energy employees exposed to hazardous material, workers involved in the manufacturing of atomic bombs, and veterans injured on active duty in the Armed Forces. A 2004 report (Hunt, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001672">2004</CitationRef>) noted the extreme variance across States regarding the adequacy of medical and earning replacement benefits. It is clear that the United States does not have “a workers’ compensation system,” but rather a myriad of systems that provide benefits in very different manners. The relationships between the insurance industry and each State’s regulations has been empirically ­determined to impact businesses’ willingness to acknowledge reports of industrial injuries and to commence benefits in workers’ compensation systems (Boden &amp; Ruser, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001616">2003</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Data indicate that the rates at which employees return to the workforce following industrial injury vary dramatically between countries. For example, a six-country cohort study of chronic low back patients indicated a sustainable return-to-work (RTW) rate, ranging from 22 % in a German cohort to 62 % in a Dutch cohort at 2 years of follow up (Anema, Schellart, &amp; Cassidy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00164">2009</CitationRef>). The authors of the study attributed this wide range to variance in applied work interventions and the eligibility criteria for long-term disability benefits. Some in the United States have lambasted the American “welfare mentality” as contributing to deficiencies in returning injured workers to work, presenting a “moral hazard” (Bolduc, Fortin, Labreqecque, &amp; Lanoie, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001617">2002</CitationRef>). This conceptualization is certainly consistent with criticism that our work ethic has devolved into a “something-for-nothing” mentality.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The infeasibility of even directly comparing States’ workers’ compensation data has recently been noted. Stover and Seixas (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0016145">2009</CitationRef>) attributed this problem to a number of factors, including inconsistencies in “statutes of limitations” for filing, employer-selection vs. worker-selection of initial physician seen for treatment, exclusion of certain industries and occupations, exclusion by employer size, exclusion of self-insured companies, and specific illnesses or injuries covered by State systems. Moreover, a recent study assessed the heterogeneity of treatment of work-related acute pain from a geographical perspective. Webster and colleagues (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0016160">2009</CitationRef>) examined workers’ compensation claims for acute low back pain, and found that the rate of opioid prescription ranged from 5.7 % of patients in Massachusetts, to 52.9 % in South Carolina. Given the prodigious body of evidence that suggests that workers’ compensation patients who are prescribed opioid analgesics are less likely to return to work and experience prolonged disability (Dersh et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001634">2007</CitationRef>; Gross et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001656">2009</CitationRef>; Kidner, Mayer, &amp; Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001683">2009</CitationRef>; Mahmud et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016101">2000</CitationRef>; Volinn, Fargo, &amp; Fine, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016156">2009</CitationRef>; Webster, Verma, &amp; Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016161">2007</CitationRef>), the implications of these findings are formidable. Irrespectively, more empirical investigation is necessary before concrete conclusions regarding this relationship can be comfortably drawn.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">States vary in their regulations regarding compromise and release (C&amp;R) as a means of mitigating expenses to carriers for medical services and/or lost wage indemnity, with a recent analysis determining that the vast majority of States allow such agreements (Hunt &amp; Barth, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001674">2010</CitationRef>). The authors note, however, that certain States actively discourage C&amp;R in workers’ compensation. Considerable variance is seen in the average amount of these “lump-sum” payments, ranging from approximately $13,000.00 in Indiana to $49,000.00 in Pennsylvania (Telles, Eccleston, Radeva, Yang, &amp; Tanabe, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016151">2009</CitationRef>). It has been speculated that the practice of C&amp;R serves to discourage return to employment (Reville, Boden, Biddle, &amp; Mardesich, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016121">2001</CitationRef>), with a study conducted by the Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor in 2009 (State of Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016142">2009</CitationRef>) indicating a tendency for injured workers receiving settlements to accept their lump-sum payment and leave the work force. However, it should be noted that the complexity of the relationship between lost wage indemnity and disability has likely been underestimated, and that results of a single-State study, such as that performed in Minnesota, do not necessarily generalize to other geographic regions.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00163">
                <Heading>The Complex Relationship Between Workers’ Compensation Indemnity and Disability</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Common sense suggests that those who are entitled to lost wage indemnity through workers’ compensation deserve such financial support because they are truly disabled. However, many theorists and empirical investigators have attempted to unravel the very complicated relationship between financial compensation and disability, with the heterogeneity of results suggesting that doing so is a challenging endeavor. Much of the research aimed at understanding how financial compensation impacts disability has examined differences in disability between compensated vs. non-compensated patients, with early research (Abram, Anderson, &amp; Maitra-D’Cruze, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00162">1981</CitationRef>; Brena, Chapman, &amp; Bradford, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001620">1980</CitationRef>; Sander &amp; Meyers, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016126">1986</CitationRef>; Trief &amp; Stein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016154">1985</CitationRef>) suggesting, for the most part, that those receiving compensation experienced poorer treatment outcomes compared to those who were not being compensated. However, results of a more methodologically robust study by Dworkin and colleagues in 1985 (Dworkin, Handlin, &amp; Richlin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001637">1985</CitationRef>) suggest that when employment and compensation are jointly used to predict outcome, only employment status is significant. The authors utilized their results to bring question to the potentially deleterious effects of the concept of “<Emphasis Type="Italic">compensation neurosis.</Emphasis>” A 1988 study by Jamison and colleagues (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001680">1988</CitationRef>) found that <Emphasis Type="Italic">time-limited</Emphasis> compensation did not necessarily adversely affect clinical outcomes or return-to-work status, although <Emphasis Type="Italic">unlimited</Emphasis> compensation may do so. Accordingly, the authors concluded that those receiving time-limited financial benefits may not represent a “problem” subgroup of chronic pain patients. This is logically sound, as many in the Jamison et al. study (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001680">Jamison et al.</CitationRef>), whose vocational outcomes were not adversely affected, were <Emphasis Type="Italic">acute</Emphasis> pain sufferers rather than <Emphasis Type="Italic">chronic</Emphasis> pain patients. The tremendous variance in psychosocial sequelae of chronic vs. acute pain sufferers, although beyond the scope of this analysis, is obvious.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Although many subsequent studies (Biondi &amp; Greenberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001614">1990</CitationRef>; Hanley &amp; Levy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001662">1989</CitationRef>; Herron &amp; Mangelsdorf, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001667">1991</CitationRef>; Kleinke &amp; Spangler, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001686">1988</CitationRef>; Tollison, Satterthwaite, Kriegel, &amp; Hinnant, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016152">1990</CitationRef>) have suggested that receiving compensation payments is related to inferior clinical outcomes, other investigations (Barnes, Smith, Gatchel, &amp; Mayer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00168">1989</CitationRef>; Connally &amp; Sanders, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001629">1991</CitationRef>; Jamison et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001680">1988</CitationRef>) have indicated the likely presence of intervening variables in determining the relationship. Through reviews, Mendelson (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0016105">1986</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016106">1988</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016107">1991</CitationRef>) and, more recently, others (Bryant, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001622">2003</CitationRef>; Spearing &amp; Connelly, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016139">2010</CitationRef>) have strongly challenged the validity of the concept of “<Emphasis Type="Italic">compensation neurosis</Emphasis>”—despite its continued utilization to “explain” failure to recover from work-related injuries by insurance carriers and defense attorneys. Interestingly, numerous studies and systematic reviews conducted on populations outside of the United States (Abbott, Rounsefell, Fraser, &amp; Goss, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00161">1990</CitationRef>; Allaz, Vannotti, &amp; Desmeules, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00163">1998</CitationRef>; Mendelson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016108">1995</CitationRef>; Ownsworth, Fleming, &amp; Hardwick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016116">2006</CitationRef>; Schlesinger, Hering-Hanit, &amp; Dagan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016132">2001</CitationRef>; Scholten-Peeters, Verhagen, &amp; Bekkering, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016133">2003</CitationRef>; Shin, Chang-Bong, &amp; Min-Su, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016136">2010</CitationRef>; Wood &amp; Rutterford, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016163">2006</CitationRef>) were even less likely to identify a relationship between receiving compensation and poor clinical outcomes when compared to American investigations. This suggests that there exists something inherent in the American system(s) of compensation that ­provides a greater disincentive to return to work than is the case in other nations’ systems. Accordingly, one can speculate that, compared to workers in other industrialized nations in which health care is guaranteed through the government, injured American workers may be reluctant to allow their workers’ compensation benefits to be terminated partially due to a fear that they will no longer have <Emphasis Type="Italic">any</Emphasis> access to necessary medical treatment for residuals of their injuries. Although not yet empirically investigated, this author’s practice is replete with anecdotal reports from patients that this scenario indeed occurs. Campbell (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001624">2006</CitationRef>) has suggested that “<Emphasis Type="Italic">compensation neurosis</Emphasis>” is related to the wide divisions between classes in society and, accordingly, represents a reaction of anger toward social injustice. Few would argue that the divisions between classes in the United States are not more glaring than in other industrialized nations, with this assertion supported by recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0016114">n.d.</CitationRef>). It is also interesting that Hungerer and colleagues (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001671">2011</CitationRef>) recently noted that the German workers’ compensation system is more heavily focused on rehabilitative efforts as opposed to compensation payments. American systems, on the other hand, vary in the extent to which they focus on rehabilitation vs. compensation, perhaps explaining the ­variance from State-to-State in return-to-work rates. Unfortunately, as most States do not maintain data on return-to-work rates of their workers’ compensation recipients, we are forced to rely upon anecdotal reports in drawing this conclusion. Again, more accurate record maintenance will allow for research that may substantiate this position.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Irrespective of the empirical data refuting the concept of <Emphasis Type="Italic">litigation or compensation neurosis</Emphasis>, the roles of potential secondary and tertiary gain have to be considered in any discussion of a workers’ compensation system’s perpetuation of disability. “Secondary gain,” a concept that originated in the psychoanalytical literature, refers to an “…interpersonal or social advantage attained by the patient as a consequence of… illness” (Freud, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001646">1959</CitationRef>). However, the term has, over the years, become largely a legal concept (Kwan &amp; Friel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001689">2002</CitationRef>), with Finneson (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001639">1976</CitationRef>) suggesting 35 years ago that the term had come to refer to financial awards associated with disability. Although Freud considered secondary gain to represent unconscious behavior, the term has unfortunately become strongly equated with malingering, which is a conscious behavior (Dersh, Polatin, Leeman, &amp; Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001635">2004</CitationRef>). This inadequate distinction between unconscious secondary gain and consciously motivated malingering seems to be most prevalent in situations in which potential financial gain is an issue (King, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001684">1994</CitationRef>). There is no simple test for the detection of malingering, and assumptions based on limited data can be quite dangerous. According to the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology Consensus Conference Statement (Heilbronner et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001665">2009</CitationRef>), “…the context of the evaluation and overall presentation of the examinees, including background information, history information gathered during interview, observations, neuropsychological tests, and measures of response bias, should be considered in this process” (pp. 1097–1098). Although the concept of secondary gain is highly speculative, its relative lack of negative connotation, compared to the label of “malingering,” suggests that it clearly safer to use, with a considerably less pejorative connotation.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Some empirical investigation has supported the phenomenon of secondary gain in the workers’ compensation arena. For example, Loeser and colleagues (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001698">1995</CitationRef>) determined that the higher the percentage of one’s working wages that were provided as workers’ compensation lost wage indemnity, the greater the frequency and duration of workers’ compensation claims. However, other studies have failed to support secondary gain as relevant in workers’ compensation cases (Sprehe, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016141">1984</CitationRef>; Tarsh &amp; Royston, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016148">1985</CitationRef>), with Harris and colleagues (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001664">2005</CitationRef>) noting that many of the studies that lend support to the concept of secondary gain are methodologically flawed. Additionally, it is important to note that the empirical literature (Fishbain, Rosomoff, Cutler, &amp; Rosomoff, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001641">1995</CitationRef>; Bellamy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001611">1997</CitationRef>) does not necessarily support the notion that symptoms “magically” resolve with the resolution of compensation or litigation, thereby serving to detract from the strength of the argument supporting the salience of the secondary gain concept.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Despite the lack of clarity regarding the existence and impact of secondary gain, workers’ compensation systems seem to accept and even exploit the concept, at times using it to take advantage of injured workers. This process of exploitation serves as a severe stressor to many claimants (Benner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001612">2007</CitationRef>), resulting in anger, demoralization, and frustration with the system. As injured workers suffer more emotionally due to carrier accusations (often further muddled by insurers’ failure to distinguish accurately between “secondary gain” and “malingering,” as discussed above), their exacerbated depression can potentially have a demotivating impact on their efforts toward vocational reactivation. This de-motivational effect of depression has been strongly supported empirically (Cléry-Melin et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001628">2011</CitationRef>; Elliott et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001638">1996</CitationRef>; Lane, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001691">1980</CitationRef>; Richards &amp; Ruff, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016122">1989</CitationRef>), with depression identified as a predictor of failure to return to work following injury (Ash &amp; Goldstein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00165">1995</CitationRef>). Accordingly, the pejorative labeling of injured workers’ symptoms can have a significant emotional impact on them, thereby serving to further perpetuate disability. Although it is quite likely that unconscious secondary gain motivating work-avoidance plays a role in preventing vocational reactivation in many workers’ compensation cases, it is also evident that the over-attribution of its causal role can also indirectly impede the return-to-work process.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Beyond secondary gain, the concept of <Emphasis Type="Italic">tertiary gain</Emphasis> in workers’ compensation needs to be considered in any discussion of perpetuation of disability. “Tertiary gain” is a concept introduced by Dansak in 1973 (Dansak, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001630">1973</CitationRef>) that refers to benefits gained from one’s illness by one other than the actual patient. In discussing the role of tertiary gain in disability syndromes in 2001, Kwan and colleagues (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001688">2001</CitationRef>) noted that little research or discussion of the topic appeared in the literature during the 28 years following Dansak’s introduction of the concept. Unlike secondary gain, which was originally posed as an unconscious process, tertiary gain was conceptualized by the term’s originator as the result of some self-serving intent (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001630">Dansak</CitationRef>). Accordingly, it is a term that has always been utilized pejoratively, unlike secondary gain—whose meaning evolved over time into an almost universally negative one. <CitationRef CitationID="CR001688">Kwan &amp; colleagues</CitationRef> make an effort to present the concept as a “neutral phenomenon” rather than a “malignant” one by suggesting that the benefits “are attained automatically from the caregiver role, and their existence does not necessarily imply a motivation to receive gain” (p. 461). However, this effort has not necessarily been successful in the medicolegal arena. Although the authors emphasize the beneficence of the caregiver role in their analysis, they also acknowledge the potential for one to be motivated to pursue tertiary gain for non-altruistic reasons. They write, “While in that caregiver role, however, the individual may be motivated to again care not simply for ‘caring’s sake’, but to pursue the recognized opportunity for tertiary gain, and this pursuit is then the underlying motivation for their behavior” (p. 461). Dersh and colleagues (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001635">2004</CitationRef>) are kinder than most in assessing the motivation behind tertiary gain, stating that conscious, unconscious, and preconscious processes are all involved in its development.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Although several theoretical analyses of the impact of tertiary gain in potentially perpetuating disability in general have been written, there appears to be a paucity of literature regarding the role of tertiary gain in perpetuating disability specifically in cases involving workers’ compensation. While much that has been written on the potential impact of tertiary gain on disability makes reference to family members and other caretakers, the potential for claimants’ attorneys to seek tertiary gain in workers’ compensation cases should not be underestimated. Schatman (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0016129">2009</CitationRef>), for example, notes that “medical bills function as a yardstick for indication of injury severity….the potential exists for personal injury victims to ‘inflate’ the sum of their medical bills by seeking medical treatment beyond that which is necessary to address the personal injuries that have been sustained.” (p. 157). He goes on to observe that this behavior may be encouraged by injury victims’ attorneys, as doing so will also potentially increase any settlement for disability, and thereby increase their contingency fees. Although family members certainly have the potential to gain from an injured workers’ misfortune, the uniquely contentious medicolegal environment associated with workers’ compensation provides an opportune setting in which workers’ attorneys can benefit through the process of tertiary gain. This position is certainly consistent with the results of numerous studies that have associated claimants’ attorneys’ involvement with reduced likelihood of vocational reactivation (Ash &amp; Goldstein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00165">1995</CitationRef>; Bernacki &amp; Tao, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001613">2008</CitationRef>; Blackwell, Leirerer, Haupt, &amp; Kampotsis, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001615">2003</CitationRef>; Chibnall &amp; Tait, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001626">2010</CitationRef>; Gardner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001648">1991</CitationRef>; Hester, Decelles, &amp; Gaddis, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001668">1986</CitationRef>; Tate, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016149">1992</CitationRef>). Yet, workers’ compensation claimants’ attorneys are not the only players in the system that can perpetrate tertiary gain-related disability. Defense attorneys representing insurance carriers are, of course, paid for their services, typically on an hourly basis (unlike plaintiffs’ attorneys, who are typically paid on a contingency basis (Mnookin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016110">1998</CitationRef>)). Reports of personal injury defense attorneys unnecessarily running up costs certainly can be found in the literature. For example, according to a RAND report, “…some defense attorneys increase their revenue by churning a case for a while, mediating the case for a while, and then settling,…” (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001625">Carroll, Dixon, Anderson, Hogan, &amp; Sloss, n.d.</CitationRef>) (p. 22). When this occurs, the potential for the legal process associated with the case to be prolonged exists, shifting the focus from vocational reactivation to generating maximal legal fees. Carriers need to be vigilant regarding their legal representatives’ actions, as unscrupulous defense attorneys have the potential to alter the emphasis of the process from a rehabilitative one to a remunerative one. When legal battles take center stage, issues of vocational reactivation may lose their salience, and claimant disability can be inadvertently perpetuated.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">What are some of the other determinants that account for the variance across workers’ compensation systems’ abilities to return their injured workers to gainful employment? While a number of factors seem to be involved, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">overall competence</Emphasis> of various systems seems to be a crucial factor. Such competence cannot be created by the workers’ compensation carrier alone, as there exist myriad parties that are involved in determining vocational reactivation. Depending upon the system, these parties may include injured workers, their workers’ compensation carriers, treating health care providers, attorneys (who may assist or impede vocational reactivation, depending upon their motivations), vocational counselors, labor unions, and, certainly, employers. The relative influence of each of these interested parties varies from system to system. Hunt (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001676">n.d.</CitationRef>) provides us with an important analysis of comparative disability management between workers’ compensation programs in 2009, looking at programs in Canada, as well as in the United States. The author takes a unique approach, examining disability management from an historical perspective. In describing the goal of disability management, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001676">Hunt</CitationRef> writes, “Its purpose is to interrupt the negative progression of an injury or disease” (p. 1). The question arises whether all workers’ compensation systems are genuinely invested in interruption of such negative progression, as opposed to having alternative agendas that have little to do with negative progression of injury or disease per se. Although disability avoidance through accident prevention has been considered a central component of disability management for many years (Habeck, Leahy, Hunt, Chan, &amp; Welch, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001659">1991</CitationRef>), prevention is clearly beyond the scope of this present chapter. Realistically, irrespective of the rigor of accident prevention efforts, unwanted job-related injuries will occur. Given this unfortunate reality, the salient question becomes how different workers’ compensation systems deal with injured workers once they are actually injured.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">According to Hunt (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001676">n.d.</CitationRef>), “Successful resolution relies primarily on the flexibility and willingness of the workplace to make accommodations and modifications, either temporary or permanent, to enable the worker to perform productive work successfully and safely” (p. 3). With so much focus on the claimant, treating health care providers, and, of course, the workers’ compensation carrier, the role of the employer in determining vocational reactivation and disability management is often underestimated. Although the success of return-to-work efforts is traditionally attributed to worker characteristics such as beliefs, attitudes, and motivation, a 2003 Canadian study (Baril, Clarke, Friesen, Stock, &amp; Cole, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00167">2003</CitationRef>) found that injured workers, their representatives, and health and safety managers attribute successful vocational reactivation to the workplace culture and consideration of the worker’s well-being. Early international disability prevention and management studies, such as that conducted in the 1970s on Finnish municipal workers, involved workplace assessment (Järvikoski &amp; Tuunainen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001681">1978</CitationRef>), which occurs far too infrequently in most systems. While it has been claimed that there was a shift in the emphasis of workers’ compensation in the United States to vocational reactivation over the last 20 years of the last century (Spieler &amp; Burton, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016140">1998</CitationRef>), <CitationRef CitationID="CR001676">Hunt</CitationRef> notes that the leadership role in disability management in the Canadian workers’ compensation system has recently shifted to unions, employers, and other “interested individuals” working together in the interests of all involved. A recent Canadian qualitative study (MacEachen, Kosny, Ferrier, &amp; Chambers, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016100">2010</CitationRef>) determined that, when an imbalance in power between these parties occurs, communication problems and impediment of return-to-work efforts arise, thereby potentially perpetuating disability unnecessarily. Following the Canadian example, the International Labour Organization has conceptualized disability management as optimally involving a combined union-management effort that includes the goal of maintenance of injured worker employment (International Labour Organization, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001679">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Employer goodwill toward injured employees has been empirically linked to a successful return to work (MacEachen, Clarke, Franche, Irvin, &amp; the Workplace-Based Return to Work Literature Review Group, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001699">2006</CitationRef>). For example, when employers are unwilling to provide workplace accommodations to an injured employee, the likelihood of successful vocational reactivation decreases—with the literature suggesting that this phenomenon occurs in multiple nations’ workers’ compensation systems (Habeck, Scully, VanTol, &amp; Hunt, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001660">1998</CitationRef>; Kirsh, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001685">2001</CitationRef>). However, it is likely that a broader approach of goodwill beyond that of the employer is necessary in order to optimize the likelihood of vocational reactivation following industrial injury. Although a spirit of <Emphasis Type="Italic">rapprochement</Emphasis> between all involved parties is likely ideal, goodwill on the part of the workers’ compensation carrier is imperative to successful vocational reactivation and disability mitigation. While the literature (Lipscomb, Moon, Li, Pompeii, &amp; Kennedy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001697">2002</CitationRef>; Kennedy, Badger, Pompeii, &amp; Lipscomb, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001682">2003</CitationRef>) suggests that managed care systems have the potential to facilitate healthy working relationships between employers, health care providers, and workers, and in doing so foster successful return-to-work, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">overly managed</Emphasis> care dictated by some workers’ compensation systems can have just the opposite effect.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Workers’ compensation system rigidity and unresponsiveness in the United Kingdom have been considered as a cause of previously fit workers becoming physically deconditioned (Disler &amp; Pallant, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001636">2001</CitationRef>), with deconditioning empirically established as contributing to disability (Okawa, Nakamura, Kudo, &amp; Ueda, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016115">2009</CitationRef>). Yet another disability-perpetuating behavior that may be evidenced by workers’ compensation systems is claim manager misinterpretation of the scientific data necessary to accurately interpret medical conditions. This was established in a Canadian study (Lippel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001696">2003</CitationRef>) as particularly problematic in regard to musculoskeletal injuries among women, resulting in a greater rate of denial of claims than among men. The author of the study writes, “Erroneous refusal of claims may thus exacerbate the gravity of the disability, and in many cases leads to permanent damage when early treatment could have prevented the onset of handicap” (p. 254). Few would argue that unjust delay or refusal of workers’ compensation benefits—particularly health care—will potentially have a negative impact on one’s health and contribute to the development of disability (Herbert, Janeway, &amp; Schecter, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001666">1999</CitationRef>). The findings of the study on non-clinician decision-makers’ misinterpretation of scientific data and its impact on the clinical decision-making process (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001696">Lippel</CitationRef>) present a potentially frightening picture of workers’ compensation systems. In an ideal system, all clinical decisions made on the administrative side would be made by well-qualified clinicians. Doing so, however, would obviously be cost-prohibitive. However, is there not a minimal level of clinical knowledge that decision-makers should possess if they are to make potentially life-altering determinations? The majority of workers’ compensation case managers, who serve as liaisons between claimants and workers’ compensation systems, are registered nurses (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0016143">State of Vermont Department of Labor, n.d.</CitationRef>). However, case managers are typically advisors to systems, and are not the clinical decision-makers. According to the United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0016155">n.d.</CitationRef>), “There are no formal education requirements for any of these occupations, and a high school degree is typically the minimal requirement needed to obtain employment.” The absurdity of such medically uneducated individuals typically lacking any medical background whatsoever making decisions regarding the treatment that a board-certified physician can provide to injured workers is obvious. Theoretically, claims managers are under the direct supervision of medical directors, who are tasked with reviewing medical aspects of claims and correcting claim managers’ errors in judgment. Unfortunately, there are often insufficient numbers of medical directors, resulting in an over-abundance of independent decision-making by unqualified parties. Given the established ­disregard for the insurance industry in general for principles of medical ethics in favor of the “business ethic” of cost-containment and profitability (Schatman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016127">2006</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016128">2007</CitationRef>), this failure to hire sufficient medical experts is not necessarily surprising. However, some practices by insurers are so outrageous that they defy belief. For example, in a recent case, this author determined that the “medical director” to whom a chronic musculoskeletal pain patient appealed her claim was actually a ­fertility specialist. When this was brought to the insurer’s attention, the denial was quickly overturned. Unfortunately, in some workers’ compensation systems, all appeals of claim manager ­decisions regarding allowance of treatment are handled <Emphasis Type="Italic">internally</Emphasis>. In such cases in which the workers’ compensation carrier is permitted to function as “judge, jury, and executioner,” obvious ethical issues arise. On a practical level, the end result is that, often, much-needed treatment is denied, thereby perpetuating a claimant’s disability.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In addition to lacking adequate educational backgrounds and medical knowledge, many claims’ managers are thought by claimants (as well as the physicians that treat their work-related injuries) to have an “ax to grind” against certain injured workers. In writing on the increasing immunity of claims adjusters, Stempel (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0016144">2009</CitationRef>) suggests that they should be held legally accountable for their misconduct, including for “bad faith.” The author writes, “Faced with reduced incentive to discharge their duties well, the other intermediaries frequently act negligently, recklessly, or even in bad faith, needlessly creating claims imbroglios that could be avoided, minimized, or streamlined” (p. 603). While Stempel (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0016144">2009</CitationRef>) writes about insurance claims adjusters in general, his thesis is certainly applicable to workers’ compensation claims managers. This creation of an adversarial relationship is not unique to the American system of workers’ compensation. In a qualitative Australian study (Roberts-Yates, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016123">2003</CitationRef>), the author identified a theme of the perception that the workers’ compensation carrier assumes that claimants are “either fraudulent or malingerers until they have proven otherwise” (p. 903). A very similar theme was identified in a Canadian qualitative study (Beardwood, Kirsh, &amp; Clark, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001610">2005</CitationRef>), in which injured workers experienced responses from their insurers that they considered “demeaning and inappropriate.”</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Yet another feature of many workers’ compensation systems that serves to perpetuate claimant disability is their lack of access to sufficient numbers of qualified health care professionals to treat injured workers. Many physicians choose not to accept workers’ compensation patients into their practices, as the time spent in dealing with the bureaucratic “red tape” is typically overwhelming and not sufficiently remunerative. In a qualitative Canadian study (Beardwood et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001610">2005</CitationRef>), injured workers identified the amount of paperwork required by their physicians as a deterrent to adequate treatment. In the United States, physician refusal to participate in workers’ compensation programs is rampant, particularly among certain specialties. In Texas and Hawaii, for example, neurologists’ participation in workers’ compensation decreased by 75 % following the adoption of a Medicare fee schedule (Illinois State Medical Society, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001678">2011</CitationRef>). A 2007 study (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001694">Levine, n.d.</CitationRef>) identified a downward trend in medical specialists’ willingness to accept workers’ compensation for the previous 10 years. Orthopedist participation ranged from 23 to 46 % in the States that were included in the study, which is particularly alarming given the crucial role of orthopedists in workers’ compensation. In a study conducted in New York State (Lax &amp; Manetti, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001692">2001</CitationRef>), the investigators found that the lack of a guarantee of payment for services rendered deterred physicians from seeing injured workers. Research has already identified a shortage of pain specialists in the United States (Breuer, Pappagallo, Tai, &amp; Portenoy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001621">2007</CitationRef>). A progressive reduction of specialists such as neurologists and orthopedists, who treat so many workers’ compensation injuries, will serve to exacerbate the impact of this shortage. As a result, fewer injured workers will receive the treatment that they need, thereby potentially perpetuating their disability.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">While it is well beyond the scope of this chapter to compare every aspect of every nation’s and every State’s workers’ compensation system, this analysis will turn to an examination of one State’s woeful performance in returning injured workers to the work force (Washington State), and how its inadequacy serves to perpetuate disability among injured workers. Although Malloy (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0016102">2003</CitationRef>) has suggested that “If an employee who has reached maximum medical improvement fails to seek employment, the employer may discontinue disability benefits” (p. 836), this is clearly not true under all workers’ compensation systems. In systems in which the carrier and the employer are essentially powerless to enforce vocational reactivation, considerable “gaming” by work-avoidant claimants may occur. The potential for disincentive for vocational reactivation is obvious in such cases, with disability needlessly perpetuating workers’ abilities to remain free of the “burdens” of work, while continuing to be compensated. Whether consciously or unconsciously motivated, one would be naïve to believe that instances of secondary do not occur in these cases.</Para>

              <Heading>The Unfortunate Example of Washington State</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A 2008 study found that the rates of Total Permanent Disability (TPD) in the Washington’s workers’ compensation system were four to eight times than those that could be expected given national data (Hunt, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001673">2008</CitationRef>). The author of this study suggests that Washington’s statute prohibiting compromise and release (C&amp;R) in workers’ compensation cases “leads to longer durations of time loss and ultimately more total permanent disability pension (TPD) awards” (p. 3). Indeed, between 1998 and 2007, the number of L&amp;I cases that were pensioned increased by over 20 %. Additionally, Hunt and colleagues (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001675">n.d.</CitationRef>) note that Washington’s system has the highest TPD rate in the United States. <CitationRef CitationID="CR001673">Hunt</CitationRef> has noted that “…the workers’ compensation system in Washington offers only two relatively extreme options, a low impairment rating with consequent small benefit, or a total permanent disability pension, with no compromise in between” (p. 3)—also contributing to subtle encouragement of disability. Compared to other States, Washington’s law calls for awarding permanent partial disability payments based on relatively low impairment ratings, resulting in the payment of relatively small benefits. Accordingly, “The permanent partial disability benefit can be perceived as inadequate and all that can be done for the worker is to leave him/her on time-loss benefits or award a pension” (Barth &amp; Hunt, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00169">2010</CitationRef>) (p. 2). Barth and Hunt (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00169">2010</CitationRef>) link the likelihood of pensions in Washington to time-loss claims of long duration, which they note is an important cost driver within the State system. They also note that vocational rehabilitation services act as a “temporary way station on the way to a pension award.” Washington lacks a coherent disability management program within the structure of L&amp;I (i.e., one that would prevent acute injuries from becoming chronic) (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00169">Barth &amp; Hunt</CitationRef>). They observe that developing such a program would require a substantial “change in orientation, structure, and function at L&amp;I.” Given the rigidity of the system, however, significant changes seem to be at least passively discouraged. Barth and Hunt also recently reported that “the incidence of pensions under Washington’s workers’ compensation program appeared to be very high and out of line with the experience of most jurisdictions in the U.S.” (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00169">Barth &amp; Hunt</CitationRef>) (p. 1). For the past 100 years, however, there has been an option for a commutation of cases, despite the lack of an option for C&amp;R. However, due to a limit of $8,500, this option has fallen into disuse (Hunt &amp; Barth, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001674">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">So much of L&amp;I’s obsessive and fanatical efforts have been aimed at reducing opioid consumption among its enrollees (Franklin et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001643">2005</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001645">2008</CitationRef>; Franklin, Rahman, Turner, Daniell, &amp; Fulton-Kehoe, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001644">2009</CitationRef>; Franklin et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001642">2012</CitationRef>; Stover et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016146">2006</CitationRef>) that attention to vocational reactivation has been minimal. Because of the weakness of the vocational component of Washington State Workers’ Compensation, two studies of multidisciplinary pain center outcomes among workers’ compensation patients (Robinson, Fulton-Kehoe, Franklin, &amp; Wu, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016124">2004</CitationRef>; Robinson, Fulton-Kehoe, Martin, &amp; Franklin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016125">2001</CitationRef>) actually found <Emphasis Type="Italic">no</Emphasis> effect for such programs on disability status, despite the myriad of American and international investigations and reviews that have been performed and that strongly support multidisciplinary treatment’s efficacy in reducing work disability (Bosy, Etlin, Corey, &amp; Lee, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001618">2010</CitationRef>; Bültmann et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001623">2009</CitationRef>; Gatchel &amp; Okifuji, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001650">2006</CitationRef>; Gatchel et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001649">2009</CitationRef>; Greenberg &amp; Bello, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001655">1996</CitationRef>; Guzmán et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001658">2002</CitationRef>; Harden &amp; Cole, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001663">1998</CitationRef>; Huge et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001670">2006</CitationRef>; Mayer, Anagnostis, Gatchel, &amp; Evans, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016104">2002</CitationRef>; Nordström-Björverud &amp; Moritz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016113">1998</CitationRef>; Schultz et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016134">2008</CitationRef>; Taylor, Simpson, Gow, &amp; McNaughton, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016150">2001</CitationRef>; Vowles, Gross, &amp; Sorrell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016157">2004</CitationRef>; Wright, Mayer, &amp; Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016164">1999</CitationRef>). Curiously, despite the findings of the studies conducted by employees and associates of L&amp;I, the agency continues to fund multidisciplinary treatment and, in fact, is the only insurer that does so in the State of Washington. However, this set of circumstances results in an ethical quandary, as when an interdisciplinary pain clinic depends on a single payer source, the payer is “always right” in situations of conflict between L&amp;I and patients—which are common in disability situations. Anecdotal reports indicate that many claimants drop out of these programs in Washington due to the perception of bias toward L&amp;I on the part of the clinics that are treating them. These premature discontinuations of treatment, of course, result in claimants not receiving the treatment that the empirical evidence indicates is most likely to help them—thereby serving to further perpetuate their disability. Although the role of the health insurance industry in perpetuating sub-optimal pain care in the United States has recently been elucidated (Schatman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016130">2011</CitationRef>), further discussion regarding the power of private insurers’ attitudes toward interdisciplinary chronic pain treatment and their more subtle impact on injured workers in certain states, such as Washington, will certainly be merited.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Fortunately, the archaic Washington State L&amp;I worker’s compensation system is finally beginning to change in a positive direction. For example, in 2011, the State Legislature passed a bill that allows for Compromise and Release for recipients of benefits ages 55 and above (Washington Engrossed House Bill <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016158">2123</CitationRef>, n.d.), which was signed into law by the Governor and took effect on June 15, 2011. As the average age of full retirement is increasing (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0016138">Social Security Online, n.d.</CitationRef>) progressively, due to economic and demographic factors as well as age of eligibility for Social Security benefits, this policy change will allow recipients to move forward with their lives by re-entering the workforce. It can be noted that this new legislation will currently impact only a small percentage of injured workers in Washington. However, the age requirement decreases to 53 in 2015 and to 50 in 2016, thereby increasing the number of workers’ compensation recipients who may be positively affected by the legislation. Despite the benefits that may ultimately be associated with this new legislation, the failure of Washington L&amp;I to return workers’ compensation recipients to active employment is due primarily to the weakness of the vocational component of the program. Anecdotally, this clinician/researcher and colleagues treating workers’ compensation recipients have concluded that anyone who desires to avoid vocational reactivation following a work-related injury can do so, particularly if that individual is represented by an attorney who is at least moderately competent. These tertiary gain issues among plaintiffs’ attorneys have already been addressed earlier in this chapter. The system assigns injured workers, in certain cases, to contracted vocational counselors, whose obvious aims are to return the worker to employment. However, irrespective of the capabilities of the vocational counselors, injured workers can easily sabotage their efforts in a variety of ways. For example, a worker who is uninterested in returning to the workforce can endorse vocational options that he/she knows are outside of his/her physical limitations, or perhaps would require such extensive retraining that L&amp;I is reluctant to make the type of financial investment that would make obtaining such a position realistic. Similarly, an injured worker can endorse vocational activity that is beyond his/her intellectual capacities—even if extensive vocational retraining were to be provided. In speaking to a number of vocational counselors, it has become apparent that they see themselves as impotent if an injured worker is “dead-set” against returning to active employment. After a period of time, the vocational counselor is deemed by L&amp;I to have been unsuccessful in his or her efforts to facilitate vocational reactivation, and that counselor is removed from the case—subsequent to which any remote possibility of vocational reactivation ceases to exist. Once there is no longer a vocational counselor working on a case, perpetual disability is almost guaranteed.</Para>

                <Heading>Case Study #1</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">“Margie” is a 53-year-old white female who was employed as a house painter for over 20 years. In 2003, she fell off of a ladder while working, sustaining three fractured ribs, a collapsed lung, a ruptured spleen, and fractured thoracic vertebrae. She was immediately transported to a regional trauma center in Seattle, where she underwent several intensive surgeries. Following a period of convalescence, she initiated physical therapy. She was prescribed high-dosage opioid analgesics, which she has continued to take for 9 years. In addition to the development of physiological and psychological dependence, the claimant developed addictive behaviors associated with her opioid use. Eventually, L&amp;I discontinued paying for her opioids, despite the fact that her attending physician (AP) continued to prescribe them. L&amp;I cited a statute within the Washington Administrative Codes (WACs) stating that, in regard to chronic non-cancer pain, payment will be provided only for treatment that “must be of a type to cure the effects of a work-related injury or illness, or it must be rehabilitative. Curative treatment produces permanent changes, which eliminate or lessen the clinical effects of an accepted condition. Rehabilitative treatment allows an injured or ill worker to regain functional activity in the presence of an interfering accepted condition. Curative and rehabilitative care produce long-term changes” (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0016159">Washington State Legislature, n.d.</CitationRef>). Based on this WAC, L&amp;I is <Emphasis Type="Italic">legally</Emphasis> justified, although not necessarily justified <Emphasis Type="Italic">ethically</Emphasis>, as L&amp;I failed to provide any alternative treatment that this patient would tolerate that would ameliorate her suffering. Certainly, few would argue that opioids represent a “cure” for chronic non-cancer pain, with a number of studies (Darchuk, Townsend, Rome, Bruce, &amp; Hooten, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001631">2010</CitationRef>; Dersh et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001633">2008</CitationRef>; Hooten, Townsend, Sletten, Bruce, &amp; Rome, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001669">2007</CitationRef>; Kidner et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001683">2009</CitationRef>; Townsend et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016153">2008</CitationRef>) suggesting that chronic opioid therapy can actually either <Emphasis Type="Italic">interfere</Emphasis> or at least not contribute positively to the success of rehabilitative efforts. However, given this patient’s issues of addiction, she was quickly able to find a so-called “pain specialist” operating a “cash-only” practice, and her opioid reliance has continued. Several psychiatric Independent Medical Examinations (IMEs) have attributed the maintenance of this claimant’s depression to the effects of chronic high-dosage opioid usage, consistent with the empirical literature on opioid-induced mood disorder (Leventhal et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001693">2011</CitationRef>; Mowla, Kianpor, Bahtoee, Sabayan, &amp; Chohedri, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016111">2008</CitationRef>; Sullivan, Von Korff, Banta-Green, Merrill, &amp; Saunders, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016147">2010</CitationRef>). Unfortunately, despite its anti-opioidist stance, L&amp;I is ultimately powerless to compel this claimant to discontinue chronic opioid therapy, or even to undergo treatment for opioid dependence and addiction.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In the period of time during which this author has worked clinically with Margie, she has repeatedly voiced a disinterest in vocational reactivation, stating that “there are no jobs that (she) wants to do.” Efforts to discuss ethical issues associated with allowing L&amp;I to financially support her when she is functionally capable of holding down some type of employment have been rejected by the claimant, due to her formidable sense of entitlement in conjunction with an ability to “play” a system whose policies toward vocational reactivation have been impotent. Margie underwent a functional capacity evaluation (FCE) per her attending physician, in which she failed the majority of the validity criteria—indicating likely submaximal effort. Despite paying for this expensive evaluation and receiving a report detailing the evaluation’s findings, L&amp;I chose not to act upon her efforts at deception. The claimant was sent to multiple interdisciplinary pain management programs, all of which at least purport to involve vocational rehabilitation components. Although figures identifying return-to-work rates of these programs are not readily available, it is evident that the efficacies of their vocational reactivation efforts are limited when compared to the return-to-work rates of the nation’s top interdisciplinary programs. For example, the Productive Rehabilitation Institute of Dallas for Ergonomics (PRIDE) functional restoration program has reported return-to-work rates following program completion of over 85 % in a cohort of 1,316 consecutively treated patients (Proctor, Mayer, Gatchel, &amp; McGeary, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016120">2004</CitationRef>). In addition to sending the claimant to interdisciplinary pain programs, L&amp;I assigned a contracted vocational counselor to her case. Despite valiant efforts to return Margie to work (many of which were observed firsthand by this author), the claimant was sufficiently “savvy” to make vocational training and reactivation impractical. The concept of secondary gain, in its most negative utilization and understanding, clearly applies in this case. Currently, Margie is awaiting receipt of a pension for total disability from L&amp;I, which has been her goal for many years. Not only has L&amp;I not lived up to its proclaimed fiduciary obligation to the taxpayers of Washington State, but its own incompetence in the area of vocational reactivation has all but assured this claimant disability status for the rest of her potential working years.</Para>

                <Heading>Case Study #2</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">“Sally” is a 46-year-old white female who sustained a severe blow to her head at work, throwing her several feet into a brick wall in 2007. In this accident, she sustained injuries to her low back and neck, as well as a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). She had been involved in another work-related accident 2 years earlier in which she slipped and fell, striking her head and injuring her low back and neck. However, according to the patient and her physicians, she had fully recovered from this initial injury, and had been able to return to work on a full-time basis well prior to her 2007 accident. Following her second accident, she sought treatment from a physiatrist with whom she had been successfully treated for injuries sustained in her first accident. The physiatrist noted pronounced depression (in addition to cognitive deficits), and referred her for a behavioral medicine evaluation through this author’s practice. While psychosocial factors, including moderate to severe depression, pronounced somatic focus, and a behavioral pacing excess were identified, she was determined to be a poor candidate for behavioral medicine services at that time due to the severity of her cognitive deficits. Shortly following her behavioral medicine evaluation, she was referred to a neurologist specializing in TBI, who has subsequently continued to serve as her attending physician. L&amp;I then sent her for a neuropsychological evaluation through an “independent” neuropsychologist, whose report indicated that she was experiencing no gross cognitive abnormalities. Interestingly, in a more recent “independent” neuropsychological evaluation funded by L&amp;I, the same neuropsychologist noted significant cognitive gains since the time of his last evaluation of the claimant. The corruption and bias associated with the Independent Medical Evaluation system has been addressed elsewhere (Schatman &amp; Sullivan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016131">2010</CitationRef>), however, and is beyond the scope of this chapter. Let it suffice to note that the claimant was deeply distressed by the very biased and grossly inaccurate findings of these L&amp;I-funded evaluations, exacerbating her depression temporarily. As a result of these exacerbations, the claimant experienced temporarily increased symptoms of depression, with associated motivational deficits exerting a negative impact on her performance in cognitive remediation. This is consistent with the reports of Benner (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001612">2007</CitationRef>), a chronic pain sufferer and medical professional, who eloquently addressed the sense of depersonalization associated with the IME process and its contribution to despair and depression. Again, the egregious and unnecessary actions of her L&amp;I Clain manager (CM) served to negatively affect the claimant’s recovery, albeit temporarily, thereby serving to perpetuate her disability.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Since sustaining her injuries in 2007, Sally’s case management by L&amp;I has been marked by severe obstructionism by the insurer, which this author considers cruel and inhumane, as well as contributing to the perpetuation of her disability. For example, while demonstrating a willingness to provide treatment for her TBI, certain evidence-based treatments for her chronic pain have been denied by L&amp;I. As one who has more than passively observed Sally’s case, it appears that L&amp;I is unwilling to accept the fact that a claimant can suffer from the cognitive effects of a TBI <Emphasis Type="Italic">while simultaneously suffering from debilitating chronic pain</Emphasis>. This seeming refusal to fully recognize and accept the comorbidity is bewildering, particularly given the substantial body of literature that addresses the frequent concomitant existence of these disorders and the need to treat both the pain and the cognitive deficits in order to restore quality of life (Branca &amp; Lake, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001619">2004</CitationRef>; Gironda et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001654">2009</CitationRef>; Iezzi, Duckworth, Mercer, &amp; Vuong, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001677">2007</CitationRef>; Lew et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001695">2009</CitationRef>; Martelli, Zasler, Bender, &amp; Nicholson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016103">2004</CitationRef>; Nampiaparampil, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016112">2008</CitationRef>; Patil et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0016117">2011</CitationRef>). Various treating health care professionals have commented that they have been forced to “fit a square peg into a round hole” in their efforts to address the multiple work-related injuries and their sequelae associated with her accident. Based on the WACs, L&amp;I-funded workers’ compensation allows for one AP; if that physician is a specialist in TBI (as is true in Sally’s case), what is the likelihood that sufficient focus will be placed on the amelioration of her suffering secondary to her chronic pain? This misguided policy also begs the question of whether a claimant can overcome her disability without all of the debilitating injuries associated with her work-related accident being appropriately addressed. Complicating this particular case was the AP’s move to a university medical school-based practice. Upon recommendation, the claimant was referred to the Department of Anesthesiology at that medical center, where she was evaluated by one of the world’s leading interventional pain specialists. After running a number of tests and providing several diagnostic injections, this physician determined that the patient’s headaches would be ameliorated through a neurotomy. Unfortunately, due to political issues within her department, the anesthesiologist was “chased” out of the university, and was compelled to return to private practice in another State. When Sally was referred to a less accomplished anesthesiologist at the university, he refuted everything that the world-renowned physician had concluded through her evaluation, and L&amp;I chose not to cover the originally recommended procedure. Once again, the claimant has been left without adequate pain management, and has been forced to rely upon medications that incapacitate her for up to 3 days each time she experiences a severe headache. According to Sally, her headaches, rather than her cognitive deficits, remain the primary factor impeding successful vocational reactivation. The claimant is aware that it will be impossible to maintain employment when she is forced to spend several days in bed at a time. This has been expressed to her CM on multiple occasions. Irrespective, nothing has been done to appropriately treat her headaches, further perpetuating her disability.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Obtaining appropriate psychiatric care for Sally has also been nightmarish. At one point, her L&amp;I’s CM questioned why she would need a psychiatrist when she is already receiving psychological counseling. Due to uncertain factors, the claimant has been extremely sensitive to psychotropic medications, demonstrating a limited capacity for tolerating their side effects as dosages are titrated toward therapeutic ranges. While she has been under the constant care of a well-qualified pain psychologist, that psychologist has been aware for several years of the absolute necessity of psychopharmacological intervention. Referrals have been made to psychiatrists, none of whom (until very recently) has had training or experience in dealing with chronic pain sufferers. Accordingly, these psychiatrists have been extremely insensitive to her needs, seeing her as a “difficult” patient, and often giving up on treating her. Compounding the problem is L&amp;I’s practice of forcing the claimant to wait for months at a time prior to providing authorizations for treatment. This practice, of course, prolongs disability, and, perhaps more egregiously, perpetuates human suffering.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">It has been interesting for this author to observe L&amp;I’s response to his efforts to serve as this unfortunate claimant’s advocate. Within the WACs, there is no provision for a patient advocate by L&amp;I, irrespective of how crucial advocacy may be in a particular case. Despite citing work emphasizing the importance of serving as patients’ <Emphasis Type="Italic">moral</Emphasis> agents as well as <Emphasis Type="Italic">therapeutic</Emphasis> agents (Giordano &amp; Schatman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001652">2008a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001653">2008b</CitationRef>), exposure of the insurer’s obstructionist policies has certainly served to incur the wrath of L&amp;I. At one point, bills for psychological services were denied, necessitating appeal. In speaking to the CM, this author questioned who would be “responsible” should the claimant commit suicide due to L&amp;I’s refusal to cover very necessary psychological services at a time at which the claimant was actively voicing suicidal ideation. To this query, the CM responded that culpability could not be determined until after the fact! In this single instance in this case, L&amp;I actually <Emphasis Type="Italic">assisted</Emphasis> the patient in her efforts to escape from disability, as their behavior seemed to temporarily motivate her through increasing her anger. However, it is unlikely that the CM’s motivation in this instance actually had any relationship to a desire to assist the claimant in overcoming her disability.</Para>

              <Heading>Summary and Conclusions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Workers’ compensation, in various forms, has existed for over 4,000 years, and has the potential to ease human suffering, improve quality of lives, and, theoretically, reduce disability. However, not only do the purpose and effectiveness of different systems vary between nations but, unfortunately, vary tremendously from State to State within the United States. As a result, American workers’ compensation systems are inconsistent, ranging from “the good, the bad, to the ugly.” Attitudes of workers’ compensation systems toward injured workers are generally negative, with claimants often considered fraudulent until proven otherwise. Beardwood and colleagues (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001610">2005</CitationRef>) wrote of systems’ attitudes toward claimants as characterized by “blame and marginalization,” stating: “The difference in the case of injured workers is that this attitude is hidden beneath the rhetoric of return to work and rehabilitation” (p. 30). Because of a lack of system support, even injured workers who are motivated for vocational reactivation are often unsuccessful in their efforts. Chronic pain sufferers in workers’ compensation systems are most vulnerable, with empirical data indicating that after 6 months, 50 % never return to work, and after a year, only 10–15 % ever work again (Gamborg, Elliott, &amp; Curtis, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001647">1992</CitationRef>). Systems’ abilities to reduce disability ultimately depend upon their overall competence. Although the Washington State L&amp;I was highlighted in this analysis in order to illustrate a system that is totally inept at returning many injured workers to vocational activity, this is not to say that other States’ systems all do a particularly good job at reducing disability either. Accordingly, future analyses need to be research-based, examining the specific elements of workers’ compensation systems that are successful in efforts at vocational reactivation and disability reduction. Unfortunately, even when an optimal system is identified, individual States are likely to support the autonomy of their own systems, as failure to do so would be acknowledging many years of failure. One area of research that would potentially be valuable would involve comparison of outcomes of federal workers’ compensation programs to those of the individual States. In this era of a growing likelihood of an eventual single-payer health care system, perhaps a federally administered workers’ compensation system would provide data supporting the government’s ability to cost-efficiently restore individuals to wellness, enhanced quality of lives, and reduced problems with perpetual disability. As it has been noted that the Social Security system in the United States is already a major (if not the primary) source for insurance for workplace disabilities (LaDou, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001690">2011</CitationRef>), perhaps a transition to a federally run system would be less dramatic than some may fear. Although the State-run system of workers’ compensation in Washington State that was discussed above has proven that it is inept in ameliorating disability, the success of the Public Health approach taken by European systems (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001690">LaDou</CitationRef>) may provide the answer(s) to the American workers’ compensation disability dilemma.</Para>
