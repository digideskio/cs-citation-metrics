            <Para TextBreak="No">Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most common noncutaneous neoplasm, and the second most common cause of cancer deaths in US men. New prostate cancer cases now account for a full third of all male cancer diagnoses and 10% of all deaths [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1_29">1</CitationRef>]. Fortunately, the death rate from prostate cancer has decreased over the last decade. Nevertheless, more than 28,000 US men are estimated to have died of advanced CaP in 2008 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2_29">2</CitationRef>]. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is in part responsible for reducing the death rate and the increased diagnosis of localized disease. Unfortunately, even with digital rectal examination and PSA screening, up to 30–40% of patients have disease that recurs and metastasizes after local therapy. Progress in robotics in radical prostatectomy, IMRT (intensity-modulated radiation therapy) in radiation therapy, and in identifying patients who will benefit from watchful waiting [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3_29">3</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR5_29">5</CitationRef>] have all been important clinical advances. Yet new approaches to metastatic disease beyond the reach of local intervention are urgently needed.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Prostate cancer offers both compelling and challenging problems for research and development of active specific immunotherapy using cancer vaccines. Despite 40 years of testing, cytotoxic drugs have not conferred survival advantages in prostate cancer as they have in treatment of testicular cancer, lymphomas, breast cancer, and colon cancer. A theoretical advantage of CaP for immunotherapy is the relatively slower tumor cell growth in most cases and longer clinical course in which to study patients and their immunity to their cancers. In concept, there is “time” to induce systemic immunity to prostate cancer in patients who have excellent performance status. A study of nearly 2,000 patients with good to moderate risk of disease and a biochemical recurrence of PSA following radical prostatectomy showed development of metastatic disease within 8 years [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6_29">6</CitationRef>]. Few situations in medical oncology offer so many patients such a significant interval for investigational therapeutics, if they are relatively well tolerated in the outpatient setting. For an effective immunotherapy, this period of time would be ideal for adjuvant immunotherapy – if an effective immunotherapy existed.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The standard of care for patients with recurrent prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The vast majority of ADT patients eventually become castration resistant. The median survival time of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) may be improved from an average of about 12 months to about 17–18 months by the addition of antineoplastic chemotherapy with taxanes, and systemic ADT earlier in the disease course [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7_29">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR8_29">8</CitationRef>]. Beyond “frontline” docetaxel-based chemotherapy for hormonal therapy refractory disease, the standard of care is treatment with investigational agents in clinical trials whenever clinically appropriate.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Vaccine strategies designed to break tolerance and generate a sustained, potent, antineoplastic immune response against prostate cancer represent a therapeutic strategy, which has emerged as a significant research enterprise over the past 15 years. A PubMed search shows 775 research reports on prostate cancer vaccines; to put the world-wide scope of the vaccine immunotherapy research activity into context, a literature search of “prostate cancer and p53 gene” generates 800 citations vs. 775 for prostate cancer vaccines.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Several approaches to prostate cancer immunotherapy have been investigated in the past decade, including defined peptide vaccines, dendritic cell-based vaccines, whole-tumor cell autologous and allogeneic vaccines, carbohydrate vaccines, and poxvirus vaccines.

This chapter will focus on a narrow segment of vaccine research: strategies employing GM-CSF gene-transduced whole prostate cancer cell vaccines (GVAX). Attention will be given to the preclinical rationale, clinical development, emerging body of knowledge on resistance mechanisms, clinical development challenges, and future directions for GVAX in particular. As Churchill once observed, some generalizations for the future of treatment research in prostate cancer – made from the basic and clinical research experience using GVAX – are likely to be only partly true. Nevertheless, the extensive data with GVAX now in humans with advanced prostate cancer is likely to be instructive in the future research and development of antineoplastic immunotherapy for prostate cancer.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Operationally, every CaP patient who succumbs to metastatic prostate cancer is the victim of genetically altered prostate cells, which have either escaped host immunity or induced immunologic tolerance or perhaps more precisely, “indifference.” Immunologic “indifference” to metastatic prostate cancer is the threshold across which all forms of immunotherapy research must cross in the clinic. Research breaking immunologic “indifference” to prostate cancer cell-associated tumor antigens spurred the clinical development of GVAX.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Historically, vaccines are perhaps most familiar in the context of infectious disease, where their history is expansive. Although documentary evidence suggests the use of sheep pox inoculations as early as the sixteenth century among African nomadic herders, vaccination appears to have originated further east in China or India where variolation with powdered scabs may have been practiced as early as 1000 <Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">AD</Emphasis> [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9_29">9</CitationRef>]. Vaccination against infectious disease typically involves the administration of attenuated whole pathogens or pathogen-derived immunogens with the intent to induce an immune response. The popular press, interest in prostate cancer vaccines, which has been disproportionate to objective clinical benefit, has been largely based on 100 years of vaccination for life-threatening illnesses.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Research on cancer vaccines is more recent. In 1957 Prehn and Main reported in the JNCI on an investigation with experimental whole cell tumor vaccines in mice to generate antitumor immune responses [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10_29">10</CitationRef>]. To the emerging field of cancer vaccines, the report was a seminal contribution. Prehn and Main demonstrated for the first time that the immunogenicity of whole cell tumor vaccines could be increased dramatically by prior gamma irradiation. Three decades prior to a molecular and cellular understanding of T-cell, B-cell, and innate immune responses to tumor-associated antigens, Prehn and Main demonstrated that autologous tumor cells could be used as immunogens. In 1975, Johns Hopkins researchers, Brannen and Coffey demonstrated that even in more advanced stages of disease, human prostate cancer cells possessed tumor-associated antigens that could be recognized within prostate cancer patients themselves [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11_29">11</CitationRef>]. A very small case series was reported from Hopkins using autologous prostate cancer cell plasma membranes in DTH (delayed-type hypersensitivity).</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Autologous cancer cell vaccine development was explored intermittently throughout the twentieth century. Different bacterial adjuvants were used in some cases. Clinical responses to whole cell tumor vaccines were rare and often short lived as a generalization outside of melanoma. Prior to the cloning of cytokine genes and the use of recombinant cytokines with tumor vaccines, it was not possible to draw even beginning inferences on the mechanism of inducing antineoplastic immune responses. Viral “oncolysates” of tumor vaccines and combinations with BCG and C. parvum and other adjuvants were used as “activators” in what we now know as attempts to generate antigen presentation at vaccine sites.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Although cancer cells offer potentially unique tumor-associated antigens that may induce tumoricidal immunity, evasion of autologous host immune response is a common and perhaps central hallmark of cancer. Prostate cancer cells are, specifically, very poorly immunogenic and are poor at antigen presentation. Autoantibodies are not seen in prostate cancer patients. In addition, defects in the major histocompatibility (MHC) class I expression occur in 85% of primary tumors and 100% of metastases [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12_29">12</CitationRef>]. Along with others, we have defined antigen presentation defects in Class I MHC surface presentation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13_29">13</CitationRef>]. Successful immunotherapy strategies against prostate cancer have to overcome the poor immunogenicity of this disease.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">One method to optimize tumor antigen presentation is to employ cytokines involved in antigen recognition and response to drive prostate tumor-associated antigens to be presented better. Significant research screening cytokines head-to-head for their ability to increase the immunogenicity of poorly immunogenic tumors was necessary to determine which cytokines to employ. Dranoff conducted the first systematic comparison of individual cytokines expressed by gene transfer in a melanoma tumor vaccine model. Compared to interleukin-2, interleukin-4, and other immunomodulatory molecules, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was the most potent cytokine signal tested for activation of antigen processing and presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14_29">14</CitationRef>]. This work on the mechanism of action of GM-CSF gene-transduced tumor vaccines also implicated DCs as a critical component for induction of immunity to poorly immunogenic tumors. Paracrine GM-CSF secreted by GM-CSF gene-transduced tumors promotes migration of DCs to vaccination sites, activates the cellular machinery of antigen phagocytosis, and enhances antigen peptide presentation. DCs are the most potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the immune system. GM-CSF, however, also has growth and maturational effects on multilineage progenitor cells, and activates other mature immune cells involved in antigen processing and presentation, such as macrophages and neutrophils [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15_29">15</CitationRef>]. APCs activated by GM-CSF enhance the immunogenicity of cancer vaccines by presenting cancer-associated antigens processed by the APCs to both CD4 (helper) and CD8 (cytolytic) T-cells in the draining lymph node of the vaccination sites [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16_29">16</CitationRef>]. The cytolytic T-cells generated by the active specific immunization with tumor-associated antigens then mount a systemic tumoricidal immune response, leave the draining lymph node of the vaccination site, and respond to metastatic cells elsewhere.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In the early 1990s, Dranoff et al. first characterized the promise of this approach using a murine model of melanoma [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14_29">14</CitationRef>]. The transduced vaccine conferred 100% protection, with vaccinated mice surviving both immediate (7 days after vaccination) and late (several months after vaccination) challenges. Mice vaccinated with the GM-CSF transduced vaccine were also able to reject preestablished tumors and to develop potent CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell-dependent systemic immunity against otherwise poorly immunogenic tumors. Irradiation of the gene-transduced vaccine was required to attenuate malignancy. Unirradiated GM-CSF gene-transduced murine tumor vaccines grew in the animal; however, irradiated GM-CSF gene-transduced poorly immunogenic tumor vaccines conferred the greatest antitumor immunity. Of note, lethal irradiation of vaccine also improved the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Extensive studies of GM-CSF gene-transduced tumor vaccines induced similar immunologic memory, protective immunity, and curative effects in the Dunning models of prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17_29">17</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR19_29">19</CitationRef>]. In one study, animals injected with GM-CSF transduced cells performed significantly better than animals administered soluble GM-CSF in combination with cancer cell vaccine. These observations suggest that paracrine secretion of the GM-CSF at vaccination sites was a superior way to recruit DCs and other APCs in comparison to bolus systemic administration of GM-CSF.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">The concept that ex vivo GM-CSF gene transduction of tumor cells could constitute antitumor immunotherapy was first explored in a Phase I trial in renal cell cancer. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was selected for the relative ease of generating an autologous tumor immunotherapy product, and the vaccine was engineered by transduction of patients’ primary tumor cells (harvested at surgery) with GM-CSF [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20_29">20</CitationRef>]. The replication-defective retroviral vector MFG containing the human GM-CSF cDNA was used. This trial showed the approach to be safe, but only short-lived immunologic responses and one clinical response were noted in 18 patients. Compared to untransduced irradiated RCC vaccine injection sites, GM-CSF gene-transduced vaccines generated distinctive APCs at the vaccine sites identical to preclinical murine models of efficacy, and patients mounted significant delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions to untransduced irradiated autologous tumor cells after vaccination. However, the proof-of-concept trial was clear that patients’ autologous tumor cells were, in general, extremely variable in terms of viability of vaccine cell for irradiation, and transduction efficiency. Setting a fixed dose of vaccine cells and fixed secretion of GM-CSF for autologous vaccines for Phase II trials was deemed very difficult for multicenter clinical trials.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The immunogenicity of whole-tumor vaccines from prostate cancer was an open question and had never been tested. Autologous, irradiated GM-CSF gene-transduced vaccines for prostate cancer were initially investigated by Simons et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21_29">21</CitationRef>]. This was also the first human gene therapy trial for prostate cancer. Surgically harvested prostate tumor cells from anatomic radical prostatectomies were placed in primary culture, irradiated, and engineered to secrete GM-CSF via the MFG replication-defective retrovirus.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In this initial Phase I human gene therapy trial, eight immunocompetent prostate cancer patients were treated with autologous, GM-CSF-secreting, irradiated tumor vaccines prepared from <Emphasis Type="Italic">ex vivo</Emphasis> retroviral transduction of surgically harvested cells. Expansion of primary cultures of autologous vaccine cells successfully met trial specifications in 8 of 11 cases (73%). The yields of the primary cell cultures limited the number of vaccination courses. Side effects were pruritis, erythema, and swelling at vaccination sites. Vaccine site biopsies demonstrated infiltrates of cells consistent with DCs and macrophages among prostate tumor vaccine cells after 3 days of vaccination. Vaccination activated new T-cell and B-cell immune responses against PCA antigens. T-cell responses, evaluated by assessing DTH reactions against untransduced autologous tumor cells, were evident in two of eight patients before vaccination and in seven of eight patients after treatment. Reactive DTH site biopsies manifested infiltrates of effector cells consisting of CD45RO+ T-cells, and degranulating eosinophils consistent with activation of both Th1 and Th2 T-cell responses. A distinctive eosinophilic vasculitis was evident near autologous tumor cells at vaccine sites, and at DTH sites. B-cell responses were also induced. Sera from three of eight vaccinated men contained new antibodies recognizing polypeptides of 26, 31, and 150 kDa in protein extracts from prostate cells. The 150-kDa polypeptide was expressed by LNCaP and PC-3 CaP cells, as well as by normal prostate epithelial cells, but not by prostate stromal cells. No antibodies against PSA were detected. These data suggest that both T-cell and B-cell immune responses to human CaP can be generated by treatment with irradiated, GM-CSF gene-transduced CaP vaccines. The numerous technical difficulties involved in the preparation and expansion of primary autologous prostate tumor cells, however, represent a significant limitation for clinical development of this approach. In this study, a sufficient volume of cells could not be harvested in three of 11 patients attempted. In addition, the individualized preparation of the vaccine was labor intensive and not robust enough for larger Phase II trials. Successful expansion of autologous prostate vaccine cells did not appear to be correlated with Gleason grade or obvious clinical factors. Furthermore, variability in the autologous cells precluded the development of vaccines with reproducible and robust immunogenicity between patients.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">An approach to overcome the difficulties involved in engineering an autologous tumor vaccine emerged out of the observation that the immune system is not directly primed by antigen on tumor cells. Rather, these cells are phagocytosed and antigen is presented on professional antigen-presenting-cells from the host, i.e., DCs and macrophages. In other words, an irradiated GM-CSF gene-transduced tumor cell that expressed tumor-associated antigens shared by the metastatic cells in the patient could offer the “platform” for antigen loading without requiring the use of the patient’s primary tumor as the antigen source. This concept led to the hypothesis that a cell-based immunotherapy product could be created by using allogeneic prostate cancer cell lines transduced to produce the appropriate stimulatory cytokine, i.e., GM-CSF. The use of allogeneic cells lines has been applied to a number of tumor types including pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer as well as prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22_29">22</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR25_29">25</CitationRef>]. Furthermore, allogeneic vaccines can be developed from readily available established prostate cancer cell lines permitting vaccine manufacture on a large scale. An additional advantage of the allogeneic approach is that the tumor-associated antigens are processed within the autologous APCs to the autologous T-cells and B-cells via “cross priming.” Patients therefore do not need to be HLA matched a priori for these GM-CSF gene-transduced, irradiated tumor vaccines in order to participate in larger Phase II or Phase III trials. Furthermore, with the ability to expand enormous quantities of <Emphasis Type="Italic">ex vivo</Emphasis> gene-transduced allogeneic tumor vaccines (which are stable in culture – unlike primary cultures of autologous cells), makes it possible to escalate the dose and repeated durations of vaccinations. In autologous GM-CSF gene-transduced tumor vaccine trials repeated “booster” vaccination was not possible in most patients because the supply of primary cultures of vaccine cells ran out.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">An academic “proof of concept” Phase I/II trial for allogeneic GVAX for prostate cancer was conducted in the NCI S.P.O.R.E. in Prostate Cancer at Johns Hopkins [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26_29">26</CitationRef>]. The purpose of the single institution trial was to characterize the adverse effects, immunologic effects, and clinical activity of immunotherapy with irradiated, allogeneic, prostate cancer cells expressing GM-CSF. Patients who were “hormone therapy naïve” who had recurrent CaP by biochemical relapse of PSA were selected. The Phase I/II trial was conducted in selected patients in the absence of radiologic metastases who were immunologically competent to mount DTH skin reactions to common microbial recall antigens. Patients were enrolled who had not received primary radiotherapy. Treatments were administered weekly via intradermal injections of 1.2 × 10(8) GM-CSF gene-transduced, irradiated cancer cells (6 × 10(7) LNCaP cells and 6 × 10(7) PC-3 cells) for 8 weeks. Both the cell lines were transduced with the MFG-GM-CSF vector. Patients were not given booster vaccinations. Twenty-one immunocompetent patients were treated. Toxicities included local injection-site reactions, pruritus, and flu-like symptoms. All who experienced toxicity were managed as outpatients. One patient had a partial PSA response of a 7-month duration. The same patient had elevated levels of CEA at the start of vaccination and CEA levels declined to normal intercurrent with the PSA response. This patient, along with all the vaccinated patients in the trial, did not mount anti-PSA antibodies or serologic signs of autoimmune disease. All patients were treated as outpatients only. At 20 weeks post-first treatment, 16 of 21 (76%) patients showed a statistically significant decrease in PSA velocity (slope) compared with prevaccination levels (<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis> &lt; 0.001). Injection-site biopsies showed intradermal infiltrates consisting of CD1a+ DCs and CD68+ macrophages, closely analogous to both previous clinical trials using autologous GM-CSF-transduced cancer cells and preclinical models. Posttreatment, patients developed new oligoclonal antibodies reactive against at least five identified antigens expressed by LNCaP or PC-3 cells. A high-titer antibody response (&gt;1:250) against a 250-kDa antigen expressed on normal prostate epithelial cells was induced in a patient with partial PSA remission. Titers of this antibody decreased when treatment ended, and subsequent PSA relapse occurred. The nonpatient-specific prostate cancer immunotherapy had a favorable safety profile and is immunologically active. These findings warranted further evaluation of dose, schedule and assessment of efficacy.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Cell Genesys, South San Francisco, CA expanded from the academic proof of concept translational clinical development into a full-fledged clinical development program for GM-CSF gene-transduced irradiated whole prostate cancer cell vaccines. Vector improvements ensued, and an AAV based vector replaced the use of a replication-defective retroviral vector MFG [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21_29">21</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR27_29">27</CitationRef>]. Furthermore, transfected allogeneic vaccine cells were expanded in large bioprocessor vats so patients could be vaccinated with single production “lots” under Good Manufacturing Practice. The company’s IND-based GVAX vaccine was a combination of the two human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP. These two cell lines were chosen in order to provide a potentially complementary source of potential tumor-associated antigens that might be expressed at metastatic sites. LnCaP as a cell line was derived from disease metastasis to a lymph node, and expresses a number of prostate epithelial antigens including PSMA and PSA. PC-3 is an androgen-refractory cell line derived from a bone metastasis and expresses several cancer-associated proteases [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28_29">28</CitationRef>]. Both cell lines were similarly transduced with an AAV-human GM-CSF cDNA vector and expressed high levels of paracrine, bioactive, human GM-CSF.</Para>

              <Heading>Phase II: G-9803 and G-0010</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Two Phase II trials were conducted in CRPC patients with radiologically confirmed metastatic disease (metastatic CRPC) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26_29">26</CitationRef>]. The first study (G-9803) administered GVAX in the outpatient setting, enrolling 34 patients who were selected for their excellent performance status and who had CRPC but were asymptomatic with their metastases. Multiple vaccinations were found to be very tolerable for outpatient treatment with no induction of autoimmune disease observed. Vaccine-site pruritis and erythema were the major consistent toxicity. The median survival for the GVAX-treated patients was 26.2 months, suggesting an improvement with vaccination in light of the 18-month median survival for patients with CRPC-receiving docetaxel. Comparing favorably at the time with palliative chemotherapy, this clinical result of median survival improvement exceeded expectations based on the natural history of the disease in this patient population, and stimulated interest in larger studies evaluating efficacy and increased vaccine dose. There was not, however, a high frequency of PSA responses in the Phase II trial, even in patients whose survival appeared to be prolonged with time.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The Phase II study G-0010 in asymptomatic metastatic HRPC was subsequently initiated as a follow-up to the G-9803 study. The AAV-GM-CSF gene-transduced LnCAP and PC-3 combined allogeneic vaccine product was used at higher doses in this Phase II trial. The objective of the trial was to assess for an optimal dose for a Phase III efficacy evaluation trial. G-0010 enrolled 80 US patients who either received low-dose (200 million cells monthly), medium-dose (200 million cells biweekly), or high-dose (500 million cells as priming dose followed by 300 million cells biweekly) vaccine. Vaccine-specific antibodies were evaluated by Western blot analysis of vaccine lysates against the patient’s sera collected before and after vaccination. Osteoclastic bone degradation in CRPC metastases was simultaneously assayed using the marker type 1 carboxy terminal telopeptide. Bone scans were obtained every 3 months. PSA was assayed at each treatment visit.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Of 19 patients, 6 (32%) in the high-dose GVAX group had PSA declines after repeated vaccinations. However, PSA continued to rise for the first 2 months before decreasing, even in apparent responders to vaccination. This “delayed” induction of apparent antineoplastic immune response pattern was consistent with the hypothesized kinetics of an immunotherapeutic effect that takes weeks to develop and requires multiple rounds of vaccination. In other words, multiple, repetitive vaccinations were required to present sufficient tumor-associated antigens to activate a T-cell and B-cell response – even in immunocompetent patients. Presumably, the low immunogenicity of human prostate cancer, even in the setting of paracrine expression of GM-CSF to activate DC antigen presentation, takes multiple doses. Unlike the immediate cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy, GVAX immunotherapy responses appeared later in the course of treatment. Consistent with this idea, patients showed biochemical evidence by PSA of tumor progression prior to arrest of progression, stabilization of PSA levels, and an objective response. Bone metastatic activity was assayed in this trial as a hypothesis of using type 1 carboxy terminal telopeptide as an intermediate endpoint of response. In 34 of 55 (62%) patients with osseous metastases stable or decreasing type 1 carboxy terminal telopeptide levels were observed, suggesting osteoclast inhibition in bone metastases. Patients were not allowed to use bisphosphonates or undergo hormone therapy changes while participating in this study, precluding changes in type 1 carboxy terminal telopeptide from being attributable to such treatment. Bone scans stabilized in 31 of 72 (43%) and apparently normalized in two cases.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The proportion of patients mounting de novo IgG antibody response to at least one prostate cell line increased with vaccine dose. In the highest vaccine-dose group, 87% of patients had an immune response compared with 72 and 40% in the medium and low-dose groups, respectively (<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis> = 0.001, Kendall tau-b). To the best of our knowledge, this was the first data in humans showing a dose–response relationship with activating B-cell responses to prostate cancer-associated antigens in a vaccine. Data from the 80 patients enrolled suggest that the vaccine was well tolerated, was immunogenic in a dose-dependent fashion, and had clinical activity. These observations complemented the median survival of 26.2 months observed in the earlier G-9803 study.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">In the Phase II trials described above, injection-site reaction was the most common adverse event, and was experienced by 100% of patients treated with intradermal injections of the GVAX<Superscript>®</Superscript> for prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26_29">26</CitationRef>]. Pruritus and erythema for 3–5 days were common low-grade adverse events postvaccination. Other side effects were consistent with an immunotherapy approach, and including fatigue, and flu-like symptoms that resolved with no active management after vaccination. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. There was also no clinical or laboratory evidence of autoimmune disease in vaccinated patients despite prolonged vaccinations with irradiated allogeneic cells. Taken together, these two, small, highly selected Phase II trials suggested that larger efficacy evaluations for outpatient therapy were warranted, and provided the rationale for their design and implementation in future ongoing studies.</Para>

              <Heading>Phase III: Vital-1 and Vital-2</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Subsequently, two Phase III trials were conducted that involved community practices as well as some academic centers. These two trials were entitled VITAL-1 and VITAL-2 and were a part of the sponsoring company’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) registration strategy for GVAX. Patients in the VITAL-1 trial were enrolled in randomized open-label studies comparing vaccine to the standard-of-care chemotherapy regimen of docetaxel and prednisone. The primary objective of this study was to compare the duration of survival between the two treatment arms. The secondary objectives were the comparison between treatment arms of: (1) the proportion of patients who had a bone-related event including spinal cord compression, surgery to bone, local radiation therapy to bone, or skeletal fracture; (2) the proportion of patients who had a progression of bone metastases; and (3) time to onset of bone pain. The secondary objectives were intended to explore the impact of treatment on the significant morbidities that occur in advanced CRPC (i.e., complications of metastatic bony disease, and pain).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Data from both VITAL-1 and VITAL-2 were presented at the Genitourninary American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in late February 2009, and are summarized below. Presented in abstract form, the data have not been peer-reviewed and published at the time this chapter was written. VITAL-1 was a Phase III clinical trial designed to compare GVAX immunotherapy (CG1940/CG8711) as a monotherapy for CaP against docetaxel chemotherapy plus prednisone in 600 patients with advanced castration-resistant metastatic disease. Enrollment began in 2004 and included only chemotherapy-naïve men without cancer-related pain requiring opioid analgesics were eligible.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In 2007, the VITAL-1 trial completed enrollment with 626 patients at 131 sites in North America and the European Union. A priming dose of GVAX was administered in the GVAX arm followed by routine “maintenance” vaccine treatments. The priming dose was a 500 million cells vaccination followed by 300 million cell booster GVAX doses every 2 weeks for 13 doses. Docetaxel (75 mg/m<Superscript>2</Superscript> q 3 weeks × 9 cycles) plus prednisone (10 mg daily) was given in the control arm (D + P). The primary endpoint was superiority in overall survival in the GVAX arm. Of note, a positive trial for a survival advantage for GVAX compared with docetaxel would have been submitted to the FDA for approval. In January 2008, the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) had completed a preplanned interim efficacy analysis for VITAL-1 and recommended that the study continue, providing no further information to the sponsoring company other than the recommendation to continue the trial. On 27 Aug 2008, the Company announced that it had requested the IDMC to conduct a previously unplanned futility analysis of VITAL-1. VITAL-1 was terminated in October 2008 based on the results of that analysis, which indicated that the trial had less than a 30% chance of meeting its predefined primary endpoint.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">All 626 patients completed the initial 6-month treatment period. At the time of study termination the median follow-up was 66 weeks. Analysis of patient data from the trial revealed no imbalance in patient baseline characteristics. The Halabi predicted survival (HPS) was 16 months for the GVAX arm and the D + P arm suggesting a balance in both arms for adverse prognostic factors for CRPC. More than 45% of patients enrolled had aggressive disease at diagnosis with a primary biopsy of Gleason grade &gt;8 pattern. The median number of GVAX treatment doses was 8 (range 1–51) for GVAX and 9 (1–16) for D + P. The frequency of Grade 3 or higher related adverse events was 8.8% for the GVAX arm vs. 43% for the D + P arm. The median survival was 20.7 months for patients on GVAX and 21.7 months on D + P, hazard ratio 1.03, 95% CI (0.83, 1.28), <Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis> = 0.78, stratified log-rank test. The Kaplan–Meier (KM) curve showed GVAX crossing above the D + P survival curve at approximately 22 months in a small subset. In the subset of men with HPS &gt;18 months (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis> = 264), median survival was prolonged on GVAX (29.7 months) compared to D + P (27.1 months), HR 0.90 (0.61–1.33), <Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis> = 0.60.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">What was learned from this first multinational multicenter Phase III trial of GVAX? First, GVAX as a monotherapy does not appear to confer an antineoplastic immune response that can improve overall survival compared to standard-of-care palliative chemotherapy in most patients. At the dose and schedule chosen, single-agent GVAX treatment did not demonstrate a convincing and statistically superior overall survival compared to D + P. The observed, albeit not statistically significant, survival increase in a subset of patients with a HPS ≥18 months in VITAL-1 also suggests that this subset of patients may have a more favorable response to GVAX immunotherapy. What characteristics about patients in this subset predispose them to this response remains unknown as the trial was terminated. Treatment with GVAX, however, was generally very well tolerated in all patients treated in VITAL-1, and it had a side-effect profile favorable in comparison to that of standard-of-care palliative chemotherapy. This was particularly true for toxicities of grade 3 and higher, which GVAX caused in appreciably less frequency (8.8% vs 43%).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Interestingly, a crossover exists in the final KM survival curves for the two treatment arms of VITAL-1, with the curve for GVAX patients crossing above the chemotherapy curve at approximately the same time median survival was reached in both treatment arms (∼21 months). This has led some to hypothesize that a late favorable effect of GVAX may transpire that prolongs survival compared to chemotherapy in some patients. This finding, however, was not a primary endpoint of the trial as designed. Long-term follow-up is needed to interrogate the existence, nature, and duration of this putative “longer surviving tail” in the GVAX treatment arm of this study. Motivated in part by the unexpected KM crossover, Cell Genesys announced that it has recently taken steps to facilitate further studies of GVAX by academic investigators and the NCI.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">VITAL-2 was a Phase III trial designed to compare GVAX immunotherapy in combination with docetaxel (G + D) to docetaxel plus prednisone (D + P) in CRPC patients with metastatic disease who were <Emphasis Type="Italic">symptomatic</Emphasis> with respect to cancer-related pain. The primary endpoint of the trial was also improvement in survival. VITAL-2 was initiated in June 2005 and had enrolled 408 patients at 115 clinical trial sites located in North America and the European Union prior to study termination. VITAL-2 trial was prematurely terminated on 27 Aug 2008 following the recommendation of the trial’s IDMC, which observed in a routine safety review meeting an imbalance in deaths between the two treatment arms of the VITAL-2 study with more deaths occurring in the GVAX arm.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In contrast to the outpatient safety profile of VITAL-1, the VITAL-2 trial did raise a concern about safety in men with symptomatic pain from metastatic CaP. However, an updated analysis of adverse events showed no significant toxicities in the GVAX + Docetaxel arm that could explain the increased number of deaths in this arm. Eighty-five percent of deaths were reported as due to prostate cancer in both arms, but, at this writing, no trend has been found in this trial for the causes of death in the remaining 15% of mortalities. These observations are consistent with highly significant flaws in the study design of VITAL-2. The decision to omit concomitant prednisone in the G + D treatment arm was made to avoid the possible immunosuppressive effects of prednisone. This decision may have contributed to VITAL-2’s unfavorable outcome, particularly when docetaxel is given with prednisone in the “control arm” of the trial. Considering how well GVAX was tolerated in VITAL-1 and in the Phase II setting, vaccination of patients with advanced symptomatic stage IV prostate cancer as opposed to men with less and asymptomatic tumor burdens may have been a factor. However, further analysis of VITAL-2 data have indicated that the imbalance in deaths between the two treatment arms decreased from 20 deaths at that the time of the IDMC’s initial analysis (August 2008) to 9 deaths at the time of final analysis (December 2008).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Perhaps further academic investigations of GVAX, facilitated by Cell Genesys’s recently announced efforts, will shed some light on this unresolved question of the effects of GVAX used in combination with docetaxel in men with advanced, metastatic CRPC. It is fair to say that both VITAL-1 and VITAL-2 clinical trials treated patients with disease burdens far greater than the patient populations vaccinated in the earlier clinical trials, and it is fair to say also that, as a monotherapy, allogeneic prostate GVAX does not confer a significant objective remission rate or survival advantage in CRPC.</Para>

            <Heading>Tumor Tolerance and Cancer Vaccine Resistance: New Frontiers</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The new frontier for immunotherapy and vaccines for prostate cancer is the need to overcome a number of resistance pathways that have been identified since the entrance of GVAX into early clinical testing in 1995. While GM-CSF gene-transduced tumor cell vaccines enhance tumor antigen presentation, other forms of immune tolerance may not be overcome by even potent gene-transduced vaccines alone. Specifically, regulatory T-cells (T-regs) confer immune tolerance by suppressing the activity of their cytotoxic counterparts. While such tolerance from T-regs is required to protect healthy tissues from autoimmunity, an analysis of peripheral blood in 46 patients with epithelial malignancies showed an increase of T-reg-like CD4(+)CD25(+) cells when compared to samples from 34 healthy controls [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29_29">29</CitationRef>]. The same study also found that T-reg-like cells isolated from cancer patients inhibit natural-killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. These observations suggest prostate cancers may avert tumoricidal immunity by exploiting T-reg-mediated immune tolerance. The specific T-reg mechanisms exploited by cancer must accordingly be subverted before the full therapeutic effect of tumoricidal GM-CSF gene-transduced vaccinations can be realized in the clinic.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In addition to T-regs, the anticytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen CTLA-4 protein is perhaps the best-studied immune tumor evasion mechanism exploited by cancer. A regulator of T-cell proliferation and differentiation, CTLA-4 is expressed on the surface of T-regs and facilitates immune tumor evasion by tolerizing activated cytotoxic T-cells, suppressing their expansion, and altering differentiation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30_29">30</CitationRef>]. These effects are partly induced by changes in glucose metabolism and PI3K/Akt signaling downstream of CTLA-4 ligation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31_29">31</CitationRef>]. Preclinical evaluation of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies by Allison et al. show enhanced antitumor responses in several animal tumor models [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32_29">32</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR34_29">34</CitationRef>]. Synergy between immune modulation by CTLA-4 inhibition and immune priming with GVAX may translate into increased tumor vaccine efficacy in humans. A Phase I/II trial investigating this possibility using the CTLA-4 antibody MDX-010 in combination with GVAX is currently underway with over 20 CRPC patients at the Free University Cancer Center in Amsterdam. These data on the combination of CTLA-4 antibody and GVAX, however, have only been presented in abstract form at the time of this writing.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">A similar strategy under evaluation is to combine GVAX with targeted inhibitors against programmed death 1 (PD1), a negative immune-modulating receptor ligated by B7-family members. Like CTLA-4, PD1 is a membrane protein expressed on T-cells following activation by an APC [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35_29">35</CitationRef>]. Ligation of PD1 by its ligand PD-L1 reduces the cytokine secretions and proliferation of T-cells [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36_29">36</CitationRef>], and induces their apoptosis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR37_29">37</CitationRef>]. PD1 ligation may also inhibit cytotoxic T-cell activity through changes in PI3K/Akt signaling and glucose metabolism, but appears to function through mechanisms distinct from those used by CTLA-4 in achieving the same effects [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31_29">31</CitationRef>]. The results of anti-PD-L1 antibody use in preclinical tumor models of multiple cancer types suggest successful, albeit transient, suppression of tumor tolerance [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36_29">36</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR38_29">38</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR39_29">39</CitationRef>]. Although it is aberrantly expressed, PD-1 expression correlates with disease progression, and associates with diminished survival in kidney and bladder cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR40_29">40</CitationRef>]. PD-L1 is poorly expressed in clinically localized prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41_29">41</CitationRef>]. To the best of our knowledge prostate cancer expression of PD-L1 has yet to be assessed in metastastatic sites. DCs responsible for presenting tumor antigens from engulfed cancer cells do express PD-L1 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR42_29">42</CitationRef>], suggesting the target may be very relevant to abrogating tumor antigen tolerance in prostate cancer patients treated with cellular cancer vaccines like GVAX.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In addition to CTLA-4 and PD-1, other members of the B7-family may provide a promising series of immune-modulating targets to inhibit in combination with vaccines that load APCs with prostate tumor-associated antigens. B7-H3 is of particular interest as it is over expressed in prostate cancer and correlates with tumor aggressiveness in localized prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41_29">41</CitationRef>]. While the precise function of B7-H3 and its mechanism of action are not fully characterized, it appears to enhance T-cell proliferation and promote immune response against allografts [<CitationRef CitationID="CR43_29">43</CitationRef>]. These observations suggest prostate cancer could be uniquely susceptible to tumoricidal immunity. However, the abundant expression of B7-H3 in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues also suggests a role in self-tolerance. In a study of DCs derived from C57BL/6 mice genetically transduced to produce a soluble mouse-B7-H3 human-IgG1-Fc fusion, transduced cells had no effect on cell cycling of T-cells, inhibited T-cell IL-2 and IFN-γ production, and significantly inhibited allogeneic immunogenicity in comparison to controls [<CitationRef CitationID="CR44_29">44</CitationRef>]. The conflicting results may be due to differences in methods and models. More importantly, T-cell tolerance is mediated by a combination of signals [<CitationRef CitationID="CR45_29">45</CitationRef>]. Thus the apparent bi-functionality of B7-H3 may be due to its interactions with a multitude of other B7-family immune modulators. Efforts to break tumor tolerance in prostate cancer patients will accordingly benefit from further study of the B7-family and the development of drugs targeting their cooperative immunosuppressive signaling.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Emerging evidence suggests that lymphocyte activation gene-3 (Lag-3) is another diversely active immune-modulating cell-surface molecule that is not of the B7-family, but may inhibit antineoplastic immunity in prostate cancer. A CD4 homolog selectively expressed on T-regs, Lag-3 binds the MHC class II receptor and appears to suppress effector T-cells [<CitationRef CitationID="CR46_29">46</CitationRef>]. Anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID) is an induced ocular pathology model of immune privilege. T-regs in ACAID mice were found to express Lag-3 in greater frequency and to have a greater ability to suppress effector T-cells in comparison to T-regs from non-ACAID controls [<CitationRef CitationID="CR47_29">47</CitationRef>]. It also appears that tissue-derived adenosine-mediated peripheral immune tolerance may be caused in part by an increase in LAG-3(+) T-regs promoted by adenosine receptor ligation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR48_29">48</CitationRef>]. These observations suggest LAG-3 is an excellent candidate for making malignancies immune-privileged microenvironments. Elevated expression of LAG-3 observed on T-cells in antigen-expressing organs and tumors (including prostate cancer) further suggests a role in promoting tumor tolerance [<CitationRef CitationID="CR49_29">49</CitationRef>]. Antibodies targeting Lag-3 administered in combination with a recombinant vaccinia viral cancer vaccine in the TRAMP model of transgenic prostate cancer increased the number, restored cytotoxic activity, and caused prostatic accumulation of effector T-cells. More importantly, vaccinated mice when given the antibody displayed approximately 45% target-specific lysis on average as compared to vaccinated mice not given the antibody, which failed to mount a significant antitumor response [<CitationRef CitationID="CR49_29">49</CitationRef>]. While this finding is promising, it remains to be seen whether inhibition of Lag-3 will be as successful in the clinic or in combination with GVAX, anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 strategies.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Immune evasion to vaccination with GVAX may not solely be conferred by T-cell and APC-signaling molecules. Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (INDO) is an inducible enzyme catalyzing the initial and rate-limiting step in the catabolism of tryptophan, causing it to passively immunize against microbes dependent upon external sources of this essential amino acid [<CitationRef CitationID="CR50_29">50</CitationRef>]. It also appears to function as a major immune modulator in tumor immunology. INDO is expressed by the human placenta [<CitationRef CitationID="CR51_29">51</CitationRef>] and when inhibited by 1-methyl-tryptophan (1MT) in fetal allograft murine models of pregnancy results in rejection and abortion of conceptuses [<CitationRef CitationID="CR52_29">52</CitationRef>], suggesting a natural role for the enzyme in fetal–maternal immune tolerance. The effect is achieved by inhibiting proliferation of T-cells, which develop G1-phase cell-cycle arrest in response to tryptophan shortage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR53_29">53</CitationRef>]. An expression analysis in human cancer cell lines and a broad panel of human tumor specimens including prostatic, colorectal, pancreatic, cervical, non-small-cell lung, ovarian, and head and neck carcinoma revealed constitutive expression of INDO in solid tumors of various stages. The same investigators who evaluated human cancers evaluated immunized mice bearing P815 tumors and found INDO expression by tumors conferred resistance to immune rejection [<CitationRef CitationID="CR54_29">54</CitationRef>]. INDO inhibition with 1MT, which entered Phase I clinical trials in 2007, slowed the growth of syngeneic mouse lung carcinoma [<CitationRef CitationID="CR55_29">55</CitationRef>] and retarded the growth of spontaneously arising mammary tumors in the MMTV-neu/HER2 transgenic mouse model of breast cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR56_29">56</CitationRef>]. In both models, antitumor efficacy of 1MT monotherapy was limited but enhanced by combination with cytotoxics. More interestingly, 1MT enhanced the antitumor efficacy of a DC/Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) fusion vaccine applied to a murine LLC model [<CitationRef CitationID="CR57_29">57</CitationRef>]. These findings suggest a promise for combinations of INDO-targeting small molecules and GVAX in proof of concept clinical trials.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In addition to combining immunoregulatory therapies with vaccines, it may also be critical to investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting multiple effector T-cell suppressors to break tumor tolerance. Little is known about the synergy and overlap between immune modulators. The independent mechanisms used by PD1 and CTLA-4 to alter PI3K/Akt-signaling and glucose metabolism in activated T-cells suggests the possibility of synergy when therapeutically targeting both. Similarly, cotargeting CD4-family suppressor molecules and B7-family immune modulators may produce responses not achieved by monotherapy. Such cotargeting has yet to be evaluated in the preclinical and clinical setting. In the event a therapeutic window can be defined without the induction of autoimmunity, such combinations may be critical to breaking tumor tolerance barriers to successful cancer vaccine therapy.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Lastly, the late induction of apparent antineoplastic immune response patterns in Phase II trials of GVAX was itself hypothesis generating. This observation was consistent with the hypothesized kinetics of an immunotherapeutic effect that takes weeks to develop in most prostate cancer patients. A previously cited possibility is that multiple rounds of GVAX vaccination are required to present sufficient tumor-associated antigen to overcome a threshold for systemic antineoplastic response. Another possibility is antigen spreading might occur at the sites of metastasis after successful immunization transpires. Specifically, the cytotoxic response primed by GVAX vaccination may release tumor-associated antigens from lysed cancer cells at metastases. This additional priming at metastatic sites would provide APCs new combinations of tumor-specific epitopes, priming a sustained and more potent antineoplastic immune response. These hypothesized effects would also be manifested as a later induction of systemic antitumor responses in a clinical trial. Although highly speculative, the hypothesis of a delay in induction of immune responses in patients with advanced disease argues for combining vaccines and inhibitors of immune evasion with other cytotoxic therapies. Thus, the antitumor activity of vaccines may also be improved if given in combination with immune-modulating doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy if given in the correct schedule. Consistent with this idea, data in several preclinical models have shown synergistic cytotoxic effects from immunotherapy with GM-CSF-secreting tumor cells in combination with chemotherapy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21_29">21</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR58_29">58</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR59_29">59</CitationRef>]. Similarly, it was recently shown in the TRAMP model of prostate cancer that combining radiation therapy with a recombinant vaccinia viral anti-tumor vaccine provoked a tumoricidal immune response when either therapy alone did not [<CitationRef CitationID="CR60_29">60</CitationRef>]. Investigations probing the role of antigen spreading and the potential to enhance the immunogenicity of tumor vaccines by combination therapy with chemotherapy and radiation are warranted with vaccines like GVAX.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">A number of important conclusions can be drawn from the experience with GVAX immunotherapy. First GM-CSF tumor vaccines do appear to break immunologic tolerance in men with advanced prostate cancer by both DTH assays and induction of new IgGs. Second, induction of immune responses to prostate cancer is insufficient to confer a large survival advantage in men with CRPC when GVAX is used as monotherapy at the one dose and schedule chosen for the VITAL-1 trial. It is unclear if subset analysis of the surviving “tail” in VITAL-1 will yield additional information on the unique characteristics of these patients in terms of their immune response. Certainly, the field would benefit from knowing what molecular factors underlie the immune response or resistance to treatment. Assessment of the role and expression of inhibitory factors including but not limited to CTLA-4, PD1, B7-H3, LAG3, and INDO which play a role in defining which patients received a survival advantage from GVAX would be of great interest. An important conclusion from the VITAL-2 trial in GVAX is that patients with far advanced prostate cancer and symptomatic bone pain from osseous metastasis are unlikely to be excellent candidates for efficacy evaluations of immunotherapy – until real efficacy has been demonstrated in other and earlier stages of the disease are confirmed. Whether or not the omission of prednisone in the GVAX arm of VITAL-2 contributed to the observed imbalance in deaths in VITAL-2 is also not known. The overall determination of whether GVAX is safe or unsafe in this very advanced population is simply clouded by the withdrawal of prednisone in these patients in the GVAX arm of the trial compared to the arm of patients that received continuous prednisone.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Translational science has demonstrated that GVAX is proof of concept for DC loading. Characterization of tumor-associated antigens observed after vaccination with GVAX is ongoing. Some of these antibodies may be part of the patients’ allogeneic immune response. However, some of the IgGs may actually provide evidence that antineoplastic immune responses to antitumor antigens are adequately induced in patients, but insufficient to confer a prolonged survival advantage by themselves. Examples of GVAX-induced IgGs include antibodies directed against Filamin B and NY-ESO1 antigens.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">It has also become abundantly clear that cotargeting combinations that permit better effector cell activation after vaccine-based immunotherapy is an important direction for the entire field. Anti-CTLA-4 antibody in combination with GVAX vaccination is being investigated in a Phase I/II trial at the VUMC. What could be contemplated – based on the data reviewed above – is that an ideal cotargeting strategy for immunotherapy of CRPC would be tested in patients with the earliest signs of PSA relapse, a lower tumor burden, and excellent performance status to permit long observation after treatment. This ideal strategy would consist of testing cohorts of patients to assess the correct combination of anti-CTLA-4, anti-LAG3, indo-1 inhibitor, and anti-PD-1 agents and would characterize toxicities with these potent combinations. Autoimmune toxicities are a great potential concern in these patients, and very careful clinical assessments of autoimmune events need to be conducted in these patients. However, short of well-designed Phase II trials testing these questions, it is unlikely that murine models are going to be as informative as translational clinical research trials in <Emphasis Type="Italic">Homo sapiens</Emphasis> with advanced prostate cancer.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The murine models that created the molecular immunology of prostate cancer have their limitations including the patient observation of GVAX-associated IgGs that are generated in patients with immune responses were not predicted, nor are the tumor-associated antigens found after GVAX were found in any of the preclinical models of prostate cancer. There is no substitute for <Emphasis Type="Italic">Homo sapiens</Emphasis> with prostate cancer as subjects of intelligently designed careful immunotherapy clinical trials.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Lastly, the experience of VITAL-2 and VITAL-1 suggest that more Phase II trials with molecular surrogates may be required to better define the right patient subsets for clinical benefit – before a large Phase III program is begun.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Over 800 prostate cancer patients have been vaccinated with GM-CSF gene-transduced prostate cancer vaccine cells. Unfortunately molecular data outside of academic centers does not exist for the great majority of patients now treated. It appears incumbent on investigators in academic centers, biotechnology, in government, and the pharmaceutical industry to work together to capture more molecular data in clinical development, including Phase III registration, in order to better elicit an understanding of treatment benefit when and if it is observed. That effort would further extend our understanding of the complexities of creating a sustained antineoplastic immune response that confers a survival advantage for patients.</Para>
