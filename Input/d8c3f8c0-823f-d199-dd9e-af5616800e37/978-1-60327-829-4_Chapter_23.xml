            <Para TextBreak="No">Bone-targeted radiopharmaceuticals have an established role as safe and effective agents for the treatment of men with bone-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Three FDA approved radiopharmaceuticals are available for use by clinicians including <Superscript>153</Superscript>samarium-EDTMP, <Superscript>89</Superscript>strontium chloride, and <Superscript>32</Superscript>phosphorus. Data from placebo-controlled randomized trials support the palliative use of these compounds but no consensus currently exists regarding how these compounds should be sequenced with other agents known to be active in the CRPC patient. Multiple factors, including market forces, have limited current use. Newer bone-targeted isotopic therapies are currently under development and large phase III multinational placebo-controlled trials in bone-metastatic CRPC patients are currently being planned for <Superscript>223</Superscript>radium. Combinations of radiopharmaceuticals and chemotherapy have yielded promising survival results in small randomized studies, but confirmation of survival benefit in larger studies has yet to occur. Various combinations of radiopharmaceuticals and chemotherapy are currently under active investigation.</Para>

            <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Bone targeted therapy with radio-isotopes began nearly 60 years ago with the pioneering studies of Friedell and Storaasli [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1_23">1</CitationRef>] using <Superscript>32</Superscript>phosphorus (<Superscript>32</Superscript>P) for patients with bone-metastatic breast cancer. Studies in patients with bone-metastatic prostate cancer using radioactive phosphates date to the late 1950s [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2_23">2</CitationRef>]. Today, metastatic bone lesions can be targeted using several distinct FDA-approved radiopharmaceuticals including <Superscript>153</Superscript>samarium lexidronam (<Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonic acid or <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm-EDTMP), <Superscript>89</Superscript>Strontium chloride (<Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr), and <Superscript>32</Superscript>P. Each of these agents varies in their physical properties and mechanisms of bone-targeting, sharing in common only the relatively selective delivery of beta particles to bone metastatic lesions.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Bone metastases are the most significant clinical manifestation for the vast majority of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. The American Cancer Society current estimates for prostate cancer mortality rates indicate that approximately 28,660 deaths will occur in 2008 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3_23">3</CitationRef>]. The vast majority of these patients will have bone-metastases at the time of death. A variety of contemporary clinical trials systematically assessing both bone and soft tissue disease [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4_23">4</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR5_23">5</CitationRef>] demonstrate that bone metastases are radiographically detected in the 84–92% of patients whereas measureable soft tissue disease (predominantly lymph node) is present in 39–44% of patients. Perhaps more importantly, in these large multi-institutional chemotherapy studies, over one third of these patients had bone pain that interfered with function at the beginning of therapy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5_23">5</CitationRef>]. Thus from both radiographic and symptomatic perspective, bone metastases are highly prevalent and clinically significant in patients with metastatic CRPC.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">It has long been appreciated that prostate cancer cells are osteotropic though the exact mechanism for this tropism is debated. This topic is the subject of considerable ongoing investigation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6_23">6</CitationRef>]. One of the attractive features regarding bone-targeted therapies in metastatic prostate cancer is the fact that the ratio of bone to soft tissue metastases is remarkably high in comparison to other solid tumors. Thus, bone-targeted agents have the capacity to treat not only the most clinically relevant aspect of metastatic prostate cancer but frequently the only clear radiographic manifestation of the disease. Such is not the case for other common metastatic malignancies such as lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, etc., which typically have bone metastases as only one feature of widespread metastatic disease.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Another relatively unique aspect of prostate bone metastases is that osteoblastic growth pattern strongly predominates. Though many types of cancers may have osteoblastic manifestations, prostate cancer is the most consistent in forming osteoblastic patterns. Given that current bone-targeted radiopharmaceuticals selectively target the stroma of osteoblastic rather than osteolytic lesions, this provides a particular rationale for their utilization in patients with bone-metastatic CRPC.</Para>
          </Section1>
          <Section1 ID="Sec2">
            <Heading>Clinical Manifestations of Bone Metastases</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Clinical manifestations of bone metastases include both focal and systemic symptoms. Pain is the most common focal complaint but both pathologic fractures and cord compression are significant complications of bone metastases and these symptoms represent a source of significant morbidity in the CRPC patient. Pathologic fractures, cord compression, radiation to bone, surgery to bone, and/or a change in antineoplastic therapy secondary to bone pain have been termed as skeletal-related events (SREs). Though this particular grouping may be debatable in its utility, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted SREs as a relevant endpoint in selected registrational clinical trials [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7_23">7</CitationRef>] and thus SREs are commonly evaluated in current clinical trials evaluating patients with bone metastatic disease.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">It should be noted that evaluating various bone pains in older men with prostate cancer is not simplistic. Epidemiology studies indicate that there are over 60 million visits each year for back pain alone in the United States [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8_23">8</CitationRef>]. Various musculoskeletal pains (arthritis, muscular spasms, sciatica, etc.) are common in this setting, and new pains cannot readily be ascribed to cancer without careful questioning and radiologic investigation. In the absence of radiographic metastases, pain can typically be attributed to noncancerous causes. In the presence of radiographic evidence of metastatic cancer, pain may or may not be causally related. Data indicate that bone metastases can typically be detected by bone scan approximately 4 months before symptoms are present [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9_23">9</CitationRef>], thus the simple presence of bone metastases does not imply that pain is derived from imaged lesions.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The measurement of pain due to bone metastases is not distinct from that of other malignant-induced pain. A variety of pain scales have been utilized in clinical trials (the McGill-Melzack Questionnaire, Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Pain Descriptor Scales, etc.) and though a thorough review of this topic is relevant, it is beyond the scope of this particular chapter. Suffice it to say that pain assessments should be patient reported, repetitive, and quantitative. Regardless, as particular clinical trials are reviewed herein, the particulars of how pain was measured in that trial will be discussed as an understanding of pain assessment is critical to interpretation. Too often ignored in this context is analgesic consumption. Trials measuring pain and pain relief also require careful and repetitive measurement of analgesic utilization.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Systemic complications related to bone metastatic spread include both hypercalcemia and anemia. Hypercalcemia, a common manifestation of certain osteolytic bone tropic diseases such as multiple myeloma, is uncommon in patients with prostate cancer presumably due to relatively osteoblastic nature of prostatic metastases. Anemia in the advanced prostate cancer patient is a topic of considerable complexity. Direct invasion of marrow, androgen deprivation therapy, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), proinflammatory cytokines, and chemotherapy are implicated in the anemia of prostate cancer patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10_23">10</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR11_23">11</CitationRef>]. Though etiologies are often multifactorial, the prognostic importance of anemia in advanced disease is well documented and confirmed in multivariate analyses [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12_23">12</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13_23">13</CitationRef>]. Patients with significant anemia have a significantly shorter life-expectancy than those with normal or near-normal hemoglobin. Asthenia, loss of stamina, loss of appetite, weight loss, and occasionally fever are not specific manifestations of bone-metastatic disease, but are not uncommon in patients with advanced prostate cancer.</Para>

          <Section1 ID="Sec3">
            <Heading>Physical Properties and Mechanisms of Targeting of Bone-Targeted Radiopharmaceuticals</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Radiopharmaceuticals have often been reviewed in overly simplistic terms. In actuality, the agents used to date vary widely in particle emissions, half-life, and energy (see Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">23.1</InternalRef>). The three currently available isotopes in the United States are all beta (β) emitters but the energy, half-life, and typical bone penetration depth of these agents are quite distinct as shown in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">23.1</InternalRef>. <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm-EDTMP has both the lowest average energy for the beta emission (0.22 MeV) and the shortest physical half life (1.9 days) of the currently available bone-targeted isotopes. <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr has a much longer half life (50.5 days) and is associated with a higher energy beta emission (0.58 MeV). <Superscript>32</Superscript>P has the highest energy beta (and hence the greatest degree of bone penetration) with an average energy of 0.71 MeV and a 14 day half life. <Superscript>223</Superscript>Radium (<Superscript>223</Superscript>Rd) is the first bone-targeted alpha-emitter to enter advanced clinical trials. It has a physical half-life of 11.4 days with a complex decay chain that includes radon, polonium, lead, bismuth, and thallium radioactive isotopes. Alpha particle emitters such as <Superscript>223</Superscript>Rd are less penetrant in tissue (range typically &lt;100 μm) than β-emitters but considerably more cytotoxic to the tumor cells and supportive stromal cells due to their high linear energy transfer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14_23">14</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">After their intravenous administration, the bone-targeted radionuclides are preferentially incorporated into the sites of bone metastases at rates 2–120 times greater than that present in normal bone [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15_23">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16_23">16</CitationRef>]. <Superscript>32</Superscript>P tracks and deposits in inorganic phosphate containing complexes in the hydroxyapatite crystal contained abundantly in the areas of remodeled diseased bone and has been a relatively forgotten isotope despite early studies of efficacy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2_23">2</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17_23">17</CitationRef>]. <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm chelated to EDTMP homes to sites of new bone formation where it binds to newly deposited osteoid, which is abundantly deposited in the osteoblastic lesions associated with metastatic bone disease [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16_23">16</CitationRef>]. Without the EDTMP and its phosphonic acid groups, <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm will not concentrate in bone. <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr and <Superscript>223</Superscript>Rd [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15_23">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR18_23">18</CitationRef>] are calcium homologues and are deposited in regions of newly formed bone where there is active calcium deposition. Once embedded in the bone mineral matrix, radionuclides cause direct DNA damage to both tumor and other adjacent cells including the various aspects of tumor-associated stroma (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, etc.). Because stromal-tumor interactions have been linked to cancerous growth, the importance of stromal alteration should not be underestimated as changes in the tumor microenvironment may have important therapeutic implications (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">23.1</InternalRef>)<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab1">

            <Para TextBreak="No">Current indications for bone seeking radionuclide therapy (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">23.2</InternalRef>) involves the clear demonstration of pain attributable to bone metastatic disease. The presence of positive imaging studies are key to making a firm diagnosis of metastatic bone pain, and all clinical trials published to date evaluating this class of agents have required confirmation of bone metastases by the presence of radiographic imaging. Isotopic bone scan findings are typically used as the imaging modality, with equivocal bone scan findings being resolved by additional standard imaging modalities. The osteoblastic lesions detected by bone scan provide confirmation that a radiopharmaceutical targetable lesion is present. Little experience with radiopharmaceuticals is available for patients with osteolytic lesions that are bone scan negative, such as the nonbisphosphonate treated typical multiple myeloma patients. Laboratory findings are rarely specific and are not typically used in bone pain diagnosis though an elevated bone alkaline phosphatase can provide a confirmatory finding. N-telopeptide and other markers of bone turnover have not been used clinically in this setting (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">23.2</InternalRef>).<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab2">

            <Para TextBreak="No">Once the presence of painful bone metastases is ascertained, the patient is a potential candidate for bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical therapy. Whether this approach is optimal, however, depends on the availability and potential applicability of other therapeutic choices. For the prostate cancer patient who is hormone-therapy naïve, the first choice of therapy is standard androgen deprivation therapy. For patients with significant elements of symptomatic soft-tissue metastases, the limitation of bone-targeted therapies is readily apparent. For unifocal bone disease, external beam radiation provides a reasonable and highly effective alternative in the vast majority of patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23_23">23</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR24_23">24</CitationRef>]. If cord compression, pathologic fracture, or a high risk of pathologic fracture is suspected, alternative therapies to radiopharmaceuticals should be sought. Taken together, individuals with castrate-refractory multifocal metastatic bone disease with a minimum of soft-tissue symptoms are typically ideal for radiopharmaceutical consideration. From a safety perspective, adequate hematological status and the excretion of the particular isotope should be considered prior to finalizing decisions. <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm-EDTMP is excreted via the urine and <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr is excreted via both the urine and stool. Consequently, consideration of creatinine clearance as well as hematological parameters is needed prior to the administration of radiopharmaceuticals.</Para>

            <Heading>Overview of Randomized and Repeat-Dosing Studies with <Superscript>89</Superscript>Strontium</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The vast majority of the trials published with <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr have been small, retrospective, nonrandomized, and/or reported only in abstract form. A recent review identified 38 observational studies using <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr for the management of metastatic bone cancer. These observational trials will not be assessed and covered in this chapter given the inconclusive nature of these types of trials. In this synopsis, larger randomized trials and studies of repeated doses are emphasized.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In a comprehensive study performed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr was compared to local field radiation therapy in patients with bone-metastatic symptomatic CRPC [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25_23">25</CitationRef>]. A total of 203 patients were randomized between a single dose of 150 MBq (∼4 mCi) <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr and external beam radiation. External beam treatment planning was left to the individual center. Some patients received single doses as low as 4 Gy, whereas other patients received as much as 43 Gy in multiple fractions. The median dose/schedule was 20 Gy spread over 5 fractions. Pain was assessed by a 5 point World Health Organization (WHO) scale evaluating pain in terms of the type and frequency of analgesia required (nonopiate or opiate, regular or nonregular). Subjective pain responses using the analgesia-requirement scale were recorded in approximately one third of each patient treatment group, however, no comprehensive pain management plan was implemented across the trial sites. Time to subjective progression was approximately 3 months in each arm. Duration of pain response in responding patients was approximately 4.5 months for each treatment. There were no statistically significant differences in either the time to subjective progression or duration of pain response in responding patients. PSA declines of ≥50% were recorded in 13% of the isotope-treated patients and 10% of the external beam radiation-treated patients. Pain flare was reported in 18.4% of the isotope group as compared to 8.2% of the external beam group. The survival of <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr treated patients was compromised as compared to those receiving local field radiotherapy alone (median of 7.2 versus 11.0 months). This survival impairment was statistically significant (<Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis> = 0.0457). Toxicities were relatively mild, with grade 3 thrombocytopenia was recorded in only one patient. Though the decrement in survival has not been reported in other trials, this does represent one of the largest trials evaluating <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr to date.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In the largest prospective randomized trial evaluating radiopharmaceuticals in symptomatic and bone metastatic CRPC, 284 men in the UK were randomized between single dose <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr (200 MBq) and external beam radiation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26_23">26</CitationRef>]. In this particular study, endpoints were clearly defined and included pain at the index site, appearance of new painful sites, a requirement for additional palliative external beam radiation, and survival. The external beam radiation was either focal or hemi-body. Interestingly, the intravenous radioisotope and the two forms of external beam radiation had no significant differences in pain relief at the index site (61–66% of patients experienced relief), however, in the <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr arm, there were fewer new painful sites as compared to those patients who received the focal external beam radiation. In addition, fewer patients treated with the radioisotope (as compared to focal therapy) required subsequent radiation (2 patients vs. 12), indicating potential benefit of systemic treatment. Survival was quite short (∼21 weeks) but equal in each treatment arm. Clinically significant toxicity was minor; however, both platelets and white blood cells fell by an average of 30–40% after <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr administration.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial in 126 patients performed in Canada combining adjuvant radiopharmaceutical therapy with external beam radiation to bone, patients with painful bone metastatic CRPC were randomized to single dose placebo or <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr after local field radiotherapy was administered to the most significant site of pain [<CitationRef CitationID="CR27_23">27</CitationRef>]. In these studies, strontium was given as a single injection of 400 Mbq (10.8 mCi). This represents a dose that is 2.5 times higher than that of the FDA approved dose (4 mCi) in the United States. Endpoints included analgesic consumption, new sites of painful metastatic bone disease, survival, and a reduction of pain at the primary sites of metastatic bone pain. Using these parameters, there was a significant reduction in analgesic use at 3 months in patients assigned to <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr. In the isotope-treated group, 17% of patients were able to discontinue analgesics as compared to only 2% in the control group. In addition, there were significantly fewer new sites of active pain at 3 months. A quality-of-life analysis demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr treated patients with regard to alleviating pain and improving physical activity. There were no differences between the treatment arms in either survival or pain reduction at the index site. Toxicity in the form of grade 4 thrombocytopenia was noted in 10.4% of patients treated with <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr. Time to platelet recovery was not specified in this manuscript.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">With regard to smaller randomized trials, Lewington et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28_23">28</CitationRef>] compared <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr to placebo in 32 patients with bone-metastatic CRPC. All patients had evidence of pain from the metastatic disease. The patients were evaluated after a single dose using a single time point (5 weeks after dosing). Of the 32 patients, only 26 were evaluable. The study concluded that <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr led to an improvement in pain relief, however, the methodology of pain assessment and time points were limited and there was no quantitative assessment of analgesia requirements.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In another small randomized study involving 49 patients with metastatic CRPC, the <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr (2 mCi) or placebo was administered at monthly intervals for three doses [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29_23">29</CitationRef>]. In this particular trial, no significant differences were noted in pain variation but analgesic consumption was not monitored. The authors concluded that bone pain relief did not occur at this dose/schedule of <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr, however, the radiopharmaceutical group had a longer survival than did the placebo group. These survival results have not been replicated.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Studies on repeated doses of <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr have been reported by Kasalicky and Krajska [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30_23">30</CitationRef>]. In this study, 36% of the patients had prostate cancer (lung, breast, and others were also included). A total of 76 patients had two or more doses (2–5 doses were administered). The mean interval between doses was not specified. Typical graded adverse event reporting (common toxicity criteria) was not done in this Czech Republic study but toxicity was limited. No patient had a platelet or leukocyte decrease of &gt;50% from baseline on repeated dosing. Palliative responses were not assessed in a blinded fashion and no placebo controls were utilized. Mild improvement was noted in 41% of patients and substantial or complete improvement was noted in 47.5%.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Pons et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31_23">31</CitationRef>] retreated 16 patients with a mean interval between the first and second doses of 7 months. Though not blinded, they reported that pain relief in the retreated patients was excellent as “good clinical response” was obtained in 63% of cases. Three patients received a third dose. Significant toxicity was not reported.</Para>

            <Heading>Overview of Randomized and Repeat-Dose Studies with <Superscript>153</Superscript>Samarium-EDTMP</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Two prospective placebo-controlled randomized multi-institutional double-blind phase III trials have been performed testing the efficacy of 153Sm-EDTMP in comparison to placebo. No trials have compared this isotope to external beam radiation or another isotope. The first of these trials [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32_23">32</CitationRef>] was not completely prostate cancer focused, though 68% of the 118 patients enrolled had prostate cancer. The remaining enrolled patients had breast cancer (18%) or a variety of miscellaneous malignancies. All enrolled patients had painful bone scan-positive metastatic disease and were randomly assigned to 153Sm-EDTMP at one of two doses (0.5 or 1 mCi/kg) or a similar but nonradioactive compound (152Sm-EDTMP). Pain scores were assessed both by a daily patient recorded pain diary and a global physician assessment. The treatment was unblinded at the end of 4 weeks for any patient not responding to treatment and those patients receiving placebo and who continued to meet eligibility requirements were given the opportunity to crossover to a 1 mCi/kg dose of the radiopharmaceutical. This trial design had the advantage of allowing patients to crossover but as a consequence of removing all nonresponding patients 4 weeks posttreatment, statistically valid comparisons beyond the 4 week time period were not able to be made with regard to placebo. As measured by patient reported pain scores, the 1 mCi/kg dose had improved pain relative to the placebo group at weeks 1–4. Seventy-two percent of test group patients who received 1 mCi/kg had significantly reduced pain scores within 4 weeks after treatment. This response lasted for 16 weeks in 43% of the 1 mCi/kg dosed cohort. The decline in pain scores was also associated with a parallel analgesic consumption decrease. The 0.5 mCi/kg was less effective in pain palliation; in the FDA reviews, the 1 mCi/kg dose was approved for the palliation of pain due to bone metastases. Transient grade 3 platelet and leukocyte declines were observed in 3% and 14% of patients of the higher dose subgroup of radio-active isotope arm, typically recovering to baseline by about 8 weeks. Median platelet nadir was 45% of baseline, and median WBC decline was 51% of baseline.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Results of the second multi-institutional placebo-controlled randomized trial of 153 Sm were published by Sartor and colleagues [<CitationRef CitationID="CR33_23">33</CitationRef>]. This trial exclusively treated patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. A total of 152 bone-metastatic CRPC patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 152samarium-EDTMP (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis> = 51) or a 1 mCi/kg dose of 153Sm-EDTMP (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>= 101) and were followed up to 16 weeks. Again the crossover design of allowing nonresponders to be unblinded after 4 weeks was utilized, compromising statistical analysis beyond the 4 week time point. Response endpoints were subject’s recording of pain intensity twice daily by patients using a VAS pain assessment as well as a pain descriptor scale. Analgesic consumption was also tracked daily. Patients were contacted weekly and analgesic adjustments were made as needed, thus ongoing pain management was a part of the trial design. Significant reductions in pain scores were observed at weeks 3 and 4 (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">23.1</InternalRef>) in the radiopharmaceutical-treated group. The mean platelet and white blood count nadir was 127,000/µL and 3,800/µL, respectively. Decreases in white blood cell and platelet counts generally began within 1 or 2 weeks after dose administration, with the nadirs occurring by 3–5 weeks and recovery to normal levels by approximately week 8. No grade 4 white blood cell or platelet toxicity was noted. Grade 2, or less, toxicities were noted in 95% of the patients treated during the blinded phase of the trial.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

The aim was to assess the safety of repeat administration of 153Sm-EDTMP in patients who had been previously entered on randomized trials. Patients were not formally required to have repeat dosing but were potentially offered repeat dosing if they were deemed to have benefited from the original radiopharmaceutical dosing and continued to meet the trials eligibility criteria. Pain was assessed at baseline, and again at weeks 4 and 8, by a VAS score but the participants were not blinded nor treated with a placebo when receiving repeated doses, thus pain assessments were suboptimal. A total of 55 patients of the 202 were given repeated treatment with the 1 mCi/kg dosing schema. Grade 3 platelet declines occurred in 11%, 12%, and 17% of patients after the first, second, and third doses, respectively. Grade 3 leukopenia occurred in less than 7% of the initial and repeat dose patients and was not associated with repeat dosing. In terms of efficacy, decreases in pain scores were documented in 70%, 63%, and 80% of patients at week 4 after the first, second, or third dose administration. After the second dose of the isotope, pain score reductions were statistically significant at week 4 and week 8. For patients who received three doses, pain score reduction were significant at week 4 but not week 8.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The safety and tolerability of repetitive doses of the bone seeking radiopharmaceutical 153Sm-EDTMP were investigated in men with hormone-naive prostate cancer metastatic to bone, and it concluded that the feasible dose and schedule for repeated doses of the isotope was 2 mCi/kg given every 16 weeks for three doses [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35_23">35</CitationRef>]. In this study, beginning shortly after androgen deprivation was initiated in patients with androgen-sensitive bone metastatic prostate cancer, 4 planned doses q 12 weeks were planned. The first cohort of six patients received 153Sm-EDTMP at 2 mCi/kg per dose; three patients completed all four doses and three received three doses, however, there were seven episodes of grade 3 neutropenia and one each of grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia. Of six patients in the second cohort (153samarium 2.5 mCi/kg per dose), only one received all four doses. Four events of grade 3 neutropenia and 2 events of grade 3 thrombocytopenia were reported. The 12-week dose schedule resulted in persistent low-grade thrombocytopenia and/or leukopenia, which prevented timely administration of the four planned doses. As a result, the dose of 153Sm-EDTMP was decreased to 2 mCi/kg for a total of three doses administered every 16 weeks. Five of six patients in this cohort received all three doses of 153 Sm. There were seven episodes of reversible grade 3 neutropenia. For all 18 patients on the study, there were no drug-related serious adverse events or grade 4 nonhematologic toxicities.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Additional studies of repeat dose 153Sm-EDTMP have also been administered in CRPC patients in combination with docetaxel chemotherapy by Morris et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19_23">19</CitationRef>]. Interestingly, in this study, the 1 mCi/kg doses were administered q 6 weeks with less toxicity than expected.

            <Para TextBreak="No">After preclinical studies in rats [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18_23">18</CitationRef>], the safety of <Superscript>223</Superscript>Rd was tested by Nilsson and colleagues [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36_23">36</CitationRef>] in a single dose, phase I clinical trial consisting of 25 patients with bone metastatic breast and prostate cancer. Toxicity and adverse were analyzed over an 8-week period. The increasing dosages for each group of five patients were 46, 93, 163, 213, and 250 kBq/kg. At 1, 4, and 8-week postadministration, 52%, 60%, and 56% of patients reported improvement of pain index scores using the pain scale derived from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C 30 Questionnaire. Toxicity was minimal at these doses though diarrhea was noted in 10/25 patients and a transient bone pain “flare” was noted in 9/25 patients. Transient myelosuppression in the patients was within acceptable ranges and surprisingly mild at these dosages (grade 3 neutropenia in 1/5 patients at the highest dose and 0/5 patients with grade 3 thrombocytopenia).</Para>

This trial, though relatively small, will be covered in detail as it is the first randomized trial for an alpha-particle emitter. All patients in both placebo (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>= 30) and <Superscript>223</Superscript>Rd arms (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>= 33) were bone-metastatic (as assessed by bone scan) and were castrate-refractory. All patients received palliative external beam radiation to the most painful site (not exceeding an area of 400 cm<Superscript>2</Superscript>) followed by treatment with placebo or isotope. The test group received four doses of a 50 kBq/kg injection of <Superscript>223</Superscript>Rd every 4 weeks over a 12 week period. Bone markers and PSA were followed every 2 weeks until 4 weeks after the last injection, and then at 6, 9, and 12 months. SREs and bone-alkaline phosphatase (bALP) were co-primary end points. Secondary endpoints consisted of time to PSA progression, toxicity effects, and overall survival. A variety of bone metabolic markers were assessed. Pain was assessed by a Norwegian version of the BPI scale every 2 weeks. The bALP decreased in the test group by 65.6% and increased by 9.3% in the control group. Median time to first SRE was 14 weeks in the <Superscript>223</Superscript>Rd treated patients and 11 weeks in the placebo arm. Median change in PSA at 4 weeks post last injection (relative to baseline) was –24% in the radioisotope group and +45% in the placebo group. Median time to PSA progression was 26 weeks for the <Superscript>223</Superscript>Rd arm compared to 8 weeks in the placebo arm. Median overall survival was 65.3 weeks for the isotopic arm and 46.4 weeks for control arm (<Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis>= 0.066, see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">23.2</InternalRef>).

            <Para TextBreak="No">Baczyk et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR38_23">38</CitationRef>] have published the only direct comparison randomized trial between <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr and <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm. This trial was performed in Poland at a single institution and involved 100 patients, 60% with prostate cancer and 40 with breast cancer. Prior treatments were not specified (including hormonal therapies). <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr was used at a dose of 150 MBqs, and <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm-EDTMP was used at a dose of 37 MBq/kg. A 10 point VAS pain score was utilized in combination with assessment of analgesic consumption. A median baseline VAS score was 7 (range 5–10). A “complete effect” was recorded if the VAS scores posttreatment were 0–1; partial effects were recorded if VAS scores of 2–4. Responses were measured at a single time point, 2 months after treatment. In the prostate cancer patients, no responses were recorded in 20% of patients in each arm whereas 33% of the <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr and 40% of the <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm-EDTMP patients had a complete response. The remaining patients had partial effects, thus the overall positive effect as measured by the VAS scores at 2 months postdosing was 80% in both arms. Analgesic consumption at 2 months postdosing was –45% and –55% in the samarium and strontium arms, respectively. Adverse events were not specifically recorded, however, five cases of “severe pancytopenia” were encountered including three patients treated with <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr and two patients treated with <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm-EDTMP.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">A single institutional trial comparing <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr and <Superscript>32</Superscript>P was published from India [<CitationRef CitationID="CR39_23">39</CitationRef>]. Thirty-one patients with skeletal metastases were treated with <Superscript>32</Superscript>P (16 patients) or <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr (15 patients). Oral <Superscript>32</Superscript>P was administered as a 12 mCi dose, and <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr was as a 4 mCi (148 MBq) dose. Baseline pain scores of “5–10” were required pretherapy. Posttherapy, absence of pain was seen in 7/16 <Superscript>32</Superscript>P-treated patients and in 7/15 <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr patients. A decline in pain scores of 50% or better were observed in 14/16 patients given <Superscript>32</Superscript>P and 14/15 patients administered <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr. Mean duration of pain relief was ∼10 weeks for both isotopes. There were no significant differences in terms of toxic effects, and no patients had significant neutropenia. Though this setting was relatively small, it did not demonstrate significant differences between the older and newer isotopes.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Liepe and Kotzerke [<CitationRef CitationID="CR40_23">40</CitationRef>] evaluated <Superscript>188</Superscript>Re-HEDP, <Superscript>186</Superscript>Re-HEDP, <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm-EDTMP, and <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr effects on pain in a single institution trial in Germany consisting of 79 patients (18 breast cancer and 61 CRPC patients). The study was nonrandomized, but VAS scores and analgesic use were obtained weekly. A total of 31 patients were treated with <Superscript>188</Superscript>Re-HEDP, 15 patients each with <Superscript>186</Superscript>Re-HEDP and <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm-EDTMP, and 18 patients with <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr. Analysis of responses were somewhat hampered by the lack of blinding, the lack of placebo, the lack of randomization, and the fact that breast and prostate cancer patients were not distinctly divided. Differences between the isotopes in terms of response rate or response duration were not apparent. Approximately 70% of patients in all groups had a pain response, and approximately 15% of the patients in each group were rendered pain free. Toxicities were restricted to hematological effects (though a pain flare was noted in 19% of patients). Only one patient had a grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and no patients had grade 3 neutropenia.</Para>

              <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr has been evaluated in several distinct CRPC trials in combination with chemotherapy. The largest and the most promising trial was a single institution randomized phase II study by Tu et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21_23">21</CitationRef>] consisting of <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr in combination with weekly doxorubicin. A total of 103 bone metastatic CRPC patients received induction KAVE chemotherapy, and 72 patients were subsequently randomized. The KAVE chemotherapy consisted of ketoconazole, adriamycin, vinblastine, and estramustine. Only those patients who were able to tolerate KAVE and those without progressive cancer were eligible for <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr (4 mCi) or placebo in combination with doxorubicin for six doses (20 mg/m<Superscript>2</Superscript>/week). In the subset of patients randomized to <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr, a significantly prolonged median progression-free survival (13 vs. 7 months) and median overall survival (28 vs. 19 months) were observed. Grade 4 neutropenia was more common in the <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr group, while the incidence of grade 4 thrombocytopenia was similar. Further multi-institutional randomized studies are underway using a similar design (MDA-3410/CTSU) to confirm these important findings, but no results to date have been reported and the rate of accrual has been slower than expected.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Monotherapy with <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr (150 MBq) was compared to a combination of <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr and low dose cisplatin in 70 patients with CRPC patients reporting painful bone metastases [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22_23">22</CitationRef>]. The cisplatin was administered as three separate infusions (50 mg/m<Superscript>2</Superscript> total dose) over 11 days (before and after <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr). In this single institution study, prespecified study endpoints were bone pain palliation at 2 months, new onset bone pain, radiographic progression of bone metastases, and survival. Bone pain improved at 2 months in 91% of those with combined modality therapy as compared to 63% in the monotherapy arm. The median survival without new painful sites was 4 months versus 2 months favoring combination therapy. Bone disease progression was observed in 27% of patients in arm the combined treatment arm as compared to 64% of patients in the <Superscript>89</Superscript>Sr alone arm. There were no statistically differences in survival. Neither thrombocytopenia nor neutropenia was problematic, no grade 3 toxicities in either realm were observed.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Morris et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19_23">19</CitationRef>] recently presented initial findings of their phase I trial combining <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm-EDTMP and docetaxel in metastatic CRPC. Cohorts of 3–6 patients were treated in a dose-escalating fashion. Prior treatment with taxanes was not an exclusion criteria. Cohorts are defined by dose escalations of docetaxel at 65, 70, 75, 75, and 75 mg/m<Superscript>2</Superscript> and <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm-EDTMP was administered at 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mCi/kg. Each cycle was 6 weeks, except cohort 6, which explores a q 9 week cycle for the isotope. Docetaxel was given on day 1 and 22 and isotope on day <Emphasis Type="Bold">−</Emphasis>1 to 1 of each cycle. No dose limiting toxicity was reached though 6 of 28 patients came off study for prolonged thrombocytopenia. It was concluded that coadministration of docetaxel and <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm-EDTMP was surprisingly well tolerated even with full doses of both drugs (1 mCi/kg of isotope and 75 mg/m<Superscript>2</Superscript> of docetaxel) with each drug administered in a repetitive fashion. Interestingly, some patients who were docetaxel resistant coming into the protocol were able to respond (by PSA criteria) to combination therapy, suggesting the possibility of synergy between these two agents. Additional studies, with randomization, will be necessary to understand the therapeutic potential of this combination.</Para>

[<CitationRef CitationID="CR21_23">21</CitationRef>], patients with bone metastatic CRPC achieving a response or stabilization after four cycles of docetaxel and estramustine were given “consolidation” docetaxel at a dose of 20 mg/m<Superscript>2</Superscript>/week for 6 weeks in combination with <Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm-EDTMP (1 mCi/kg). A total of 43 patients were included in this trial [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20_23">20</CitationRef>]. A PSA response was obtained in 77%, and the pain response rate was 69%. At least five of the six planned weekly injections of docetaxel were administered to 34 patients (81%). The consolidation docetaxel-<Superscript>153</Superscript>Sm-EDTMP regimen was well tolerated with no febrile neutropenia, and only two episodes (5%) of rapidly reversible grade 3 thrombocytopenia occurred. The median survival was 29 months, the 1-year survival rate was 77%, and the 2-year survival rate was 56%. This survival exceeds expectations but confirmation in larger, multi-institutional randomized studies will be required for full credibility.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Though the use of the radiopharmaceuticals are FDA approved and supported by prospective randomized placebo-controlled trials, their use has been more limited than expected based on these data. The reasons for limited use are multifactorial and in part involve a variety of market forces.
