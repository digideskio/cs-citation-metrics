              <Para>Eleven state-of-the-science regional air quality (AQ) models, exercised by 20 independent groups in Europe and North America, have been assembled for the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII). The modelled ground-level ozone mixing ratios are collectively examined from the ensemble perspective and evaluated against observations from both continents. We aim at creating optimized ensembles in order to capture the data variability while keeping the error low. It is shown that the most commonly used ensemble approach, namely the average over all available members, can be outperformed by subsets of members optimally selected in terms of bias, error, and correlation, independent of the skill of the individual members. A clustering methodology is applied to discriminate among members and to build a skilful ensemble based on model association and data clustering.</Para>

              <Para>In this study, we analysed the ozone mixing ratios provided by simulations from 11 state-of-the-science regional AQ models run by 18 independent groups from North America (NA) and Europe (EU). Model predictions have been made available, along with observational data, to the ENSEMBLE system [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00591">1</CitationRef>]. The ability of the ensemble mean and median to reduce the error and bias of single model (SM) outputs is examined, and co regarding the size of the ensemble and its quality are made. The level of repetition provided by each individual model to the ensemble is quantified by applying clustering analysis to examine whether the improvement in error using the mean or median of the model ensemble is due to the increased ensemble size, or if information carried by each model contributes to the multi-model (MM) superiority.</Para>

              <Heading>Multi-model Analysis: Selected vs. Unselected Model Ensembles</Heading>
              <Para>We consider the distribution of some metrics (e.g. root-mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)) of the mean of all possible combinations of available ensemble members <Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>. An example of such a distribution, for any possible <Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>-member combination (<Emphasis Type="Italic">k &lt; n</Emphasis>) of the statistical analysis, is presented in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00591">59.1</InternalRef> for a European sub-region. The continuous lines on each plot represent the mean and median of the distribution of any <Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>-model combinations. Analysis of mean RMSE for EU sub-regions, for which a large set of members is available, shows that a plateau is reached for <Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis> &gt; 5. This indicates that there is no advantage, on average, to combine more than six members as the benefit in minimizing the mean RMSE is negligible. Furthermore, a minimum of RMSE, among all combinations, systematically emerges for ensembles with a number of members <Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis> &lt; <Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>. Similarly, a maximum of PCC is achieved by combinations of a subset of members. This result has been found for a number of regions in Europe and North America. This suggests that the ensemble of a few members systematically outperforms the ensemble of all members. Also, adding new members to such an optimal ensemble (thus moving towards a higher value of <Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>) deteriorates the quality of the ensemble since the minimum RMSE increases and the maximum PCC decreases. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00591">

              <Para>The next step in the analysis was to rank the ensemble members by their individual RMSE and track the RMSE positioning within the optimal ensemble combinations (full details and results are given in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00592">2</CitationRef>]). The RMSE ranking shows that the optimal ensemble is in some cases achieved by the MM ensemble containing low-ranking members, suggesting that all members should be considered in building a skilful ensemble. Therefore, an ensemble of top-ranking models can be worse than an ensemble of top-ranking and low-ranking models: that is, outliers may need to be included in the ensemble to obtain the best performance. Moreover, further analysis comparing the variability of MM combinations of selected members vs. full member ensembles shows that reducing the number of members does not degrade the ensemble variability, but instead actually compares better to the spread of the observations.</Para>

              <Heading>Reduction of Data Complexity: A Clustering Approach</Heading>
              <Para>To discern which members should be included in the ensemble, a method for clustering highly associated models and then discarding redundant information was developed using the PCC as the determining metric. The most representative models of each cluster, chosen based on a distance metric, are then used to generate a reduced or selected-member ensemble. In this way, the information that each member provides to the ensemble is “unique” to the greatest possible degree. The clustering has been applied to eight sub-regions of Europe and North-America, with individual models ranked by the RMSE for that particular sub-region. An example is given in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00592">59.2</InternalRef>, where highly associated members (low PCC distance) belong to the same cluster. Thus, an ensemble of independent members is generated by selecting one member from each cluster. We note two aspects: (<Emphasis Type="Italic">a</Emphasis>) a cluster’s representatives are not necessarily those with higher RMSE ranking, and (<Emphasis Type="Italic">b</Emphasis>) the number of independent clusters matches the number of models needed to generate the MM ensembles with minimum RMSE of Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00591">59.1</InternalRef>, for all the analysed sub-regions in both continents. The two methods are in fact independent, as the clustering analysis makes no use of observational data (only model-to-model PCC is used in the cluster analysis). <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00592">

              <Para>This study collectively analysed the performance of 11 regional AQ models and their ensembles in the context of the AQMEII inter-comparison exercise. While MM ensembles demonstrate improved performance over the individual model realizations, the most skilful ensemble is not necessarily generated by including all available model results, but instead by selecting models that result in a minimization of ensemble error. In addition, an ensemble of top-ranking model results can be worse than an ensemble of top-ranking and low-ranking model results. Until now, the prevailing assumption has been that as long as a large set of results was treated statistically in one ensemble, the ensemble would perform better than any individual ensemble member. Furthermore, it was assumed that the better the model results the better would be the ensemble. However, the analysis presented here suggests that this is not necessarily the case, as outliers also needed to be included in the ensemble to enhance performance. Furthermore, the skill score does not necessarily improve by increasing the number of models in the ensemble. By contrast, the level of inter-dependence of model results may lead to a deterioration of the results and to an overall worsening of performance. We apply a method for reducing data complexity through a clustering technique, which has the advantage of simplifying information provided by AQ model outputs by clustering the data into groups based on a selected metric, where there is no prior knowledge of grouping. Results show that by selecting the appropriate cluster distance and association criteria, one can generate an ensemble of selected members whose error is significantly lower than that of the full-member ensemble mean.</Para>

                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: The analysis was based only on ozone. Models might be good for ozone but not for other pollutants. Is this a problem?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: The analysis presented has been based on ozone for four different sub-regions of Europe and North-America. We found that, even for ozone only, the best combination of models is region-dependant. We expect that when other compounds are examined, models other than those for ozone will agree the best with the observations. However, it is important to point out that aim of the study is not to find out the best models, but to show that a subset of independent models (where the dependency is measured by means of the correlation) can outperform the ensemble mean of all available models. We expect the independence of models (and group clustering) not to depend on the specie, but for all species to find a common clustering of independent models (although the representative model of each cluster may be pollutant-dependant) (see also reply to next question). Ongoing work is devoted to clarify these aspects for a range of pollutants.</SimplePara>

              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: In the framework of the MACC project the multimodel evaluation showed that models performing best for ozone were those with the poorest performance for NO2. It is interesting whether the clustering made for ozone will be the same for other pollutants.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: We do not expect to find the same model to be representative of clusters generated for different pollutants. The clustering analysis produces groups of models that can be considered “independent” in the sense that they are uncorrelated, but it does not provide any information about the “best model”. That said, it is expected that models that are independent for one specie (e.g. ozone) are also independent for other species (e.g. NO2), although the most representative models from each independent cluster might not be the same. This is because the variance (spread) and error (accuracy) are highly specie-dependant, whilst independency should be not.</SimplePara>

              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: Indeed, clustering of models reflects the sharing of important commonalities, such as air quality system, meteorological driver, emissions and boundary conditions.</SimplePara>
