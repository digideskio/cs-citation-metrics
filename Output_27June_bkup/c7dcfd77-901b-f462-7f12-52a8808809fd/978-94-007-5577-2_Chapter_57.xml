              <Para>ATMOSYS is a LIFE + Environmental Policy &amp; Governance project co-financed by the European Commission. The project began on the 1st September 2010 and will be completed at the end of 2013. The overall objective of the project is to set up, evaluate and demonstrate an advanced and comprehensive air quality modeling system and associated web-based service, containing novel elements specifically designed for air pollution policy support in hot spot regions. The system will be implemented for the European hot spot region of Flanders by VITO together with the Flemish Environmental Agency (VMM).</Para>
              <Para>Several regions in the EU have difficulty in attaining the limits for specific air pollutants, such as NO<Subscript>2</Subscript>, and PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript>. The 2008/50/EC directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europestipulates that measures should be taken to reduce emissions and states that modeling techniques can be applied to obtain geo-spatial insights in the air quality problem and provide possible solutions.</Para>
              <Para>Recently the cost of air pollution to the Flemish region of Northern Belgium has been estimated at several hundred million euros per year [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00572">2</CitationRef>], among other things by increased absence at work caused by respiratory disease. The European Commission [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00571">1</CitationRef>] has estimated that in hot spot areas, owing to the effect of anthropogenic fine particulate matter (PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript>) alone, there is an associated loss in life expectancy of up to 13–36 months per individual, as compared to values of 2–9 months elsewhere in Europe.</Para>

            <Section1 ID="Sec00572" Type="MaterialsAndMethods">
              <Heading>Methodology</Heading>
              <Para>The ATMOSYS air quality policy support system to be implemented includes: (i) an operational daily forecasting system (up to 3 days ahead), (ii) a re-analysis service (i.e., retrospective simulations) and (iii) a scenario tool. The system contains urban/regional (AURORA) and local (ENVI-Met) components.</Para>
              <Para>The AURORA regional/urban scale model will yield output for relevant gases (e.g. NO<Subscript>2</Subscript>, benzene, O<Subscript>3</Subscript>) and particles (PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> and its constituent elements, such as elemental carbon, ammonium and sulphates), although the focus will be on pollutants with a local character. The model will contain a module to calculate concentrations near line sources (highways) at a resolution of up to a few tens of metres. The AURORA model is described in the Model Documentation System of the European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change (EIONET).</Para>
              <Para>The ENVI-Met micro scale model is a 3-D atmospheric CFD (computational fluid dynamics) model which was developed at the Universities of Bochum and Mainz and extended by VITO with an air quality module capable of calculating PM<Subscript>10</Subscript>, PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript>, EC, NO<Subscript>2</Subscript>, NO and O<Subscript>3</Subscript> transport, chemical reactions, and deposition. Research is currently in progress aiming to implement the full UFP size distribution and its relevant dynamics. Further details on ENVI-Met are available at <ExternalRef>
                  <RefSource>http://www.envi-met.com</RefSource>
                  <RefTarget Address="http://www.envi-met.com" TargetType="URL"/>
                </ExternalRef>.</Para>
              <Para>The use of 3-D atmospheric computer models for air quality policy support is not a straightforward task because of the advanced and complex nature of the models and because of the computation intensive character of the models. Performing annual simulations is therefore a great challenge, however essential in order to be compliant with the European Air Quality Directives. The targeted accuracy for the air quality forecasting will be of the order of 10 % for the most common gases, and 20–30 % for the particles. Occupying a central position, the web-based platform collects results from many other individual system modules, in particular the air quality forecasts and re-analysis simulations, provided by the AURORA and ENVI-Met models. The web-based interface also ingests information regarding the validation strategy and metrics. Finally, the model evaluation is done by accessing results contained in the web-based platform, and combining those with measurements from the experimental campaigns as well as from the routine monitoring station network.</Para>

              <Para>Despite the fact that the project is only halfway at the moment, several project elements have already been realized. The AURORA regional/urban scale model has been implemented in the system and coupled to a Gaussian module to calculate concentrations near line sources (highways) at a resolution of up to a few tens of meters.</Para>
              <Para>Results for Flanders are shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00571">57.1</InternalRef>, revealing hot spot areas near the city of Antwerp, the capital Brussels and the area of Ghent. The ENVI-Met micro-scale model yields output for most of the primary emitted gases and has been extended with a limited chemistry module for gases subject to short-range chemistry (e.g. NO-NO<Subscript>2</Subscript>-O<Subscript>3</Subscript>). Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig00572">57.2</InternalRef> shows NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> concentrations for a street canyon in an urban area. The ENVI-Met model has also been extended with a module for ultrafine particles (UFP). A fast method to calculate annual statistics from the ENVI-Met results is in development. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00571">

              <Para>With respect to the system design and architectural framework, the discussions on user requirements resulted in the use of the DELTA benchmarking tool, developed by the EC JRC within FAIRMODE, as a common functionality for model validation within ATMOSYS. Users can use ATMOSYS as an initial explorative validation tool and assess their model performance prior to entering the official JRC Benchmarking service web application.</Para>
              <Para>Automatic validation of the AURORA model is obtained by first specifying the representativeness of the in-situ air measurement locations. Additional urban measurement campaigns (PM<Subscript>10</Subscript> monitors, chemical analysis thereof and passive samplers of NO<Subscript>2</Subscript>) are organized to further assess the validation for urban background, urban location close to a major regional road and a street canyon. Another intensive measurement campaign is planned for all of 2012 where Black Carbon, PM<Subscript>10</Subscript>, PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> and NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> will be sampled at locations close to motorways.</Para>

                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: At the local scales, you are only considering NO2-O3 chemistry, and not PM (aerosols). Was that an intentional omission, or do you plan to incorporate that later?</SimplePara>

                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: This is a correct observation. For the moment the aerosol chemistry is only included in the AURORA model to account for PM formation at the urban and regional scales. At the local scale the ENVI-Met model simulates the fate of PM<Subscript>10</Subscript>, PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> and EC as tracers. However, the ENVI-Met chemistry model has been extended with a detailed aerosol (UFP) model at the local scale. At the moment it is extensively tested validated.</SimplePara>

                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: Thank you for this suggestion. Since many of the policy makers are on board as project partners, constant feedback is given throughout the project. This also includes more formal evaluation sessions for a broader audience of policy makers. It is indeed a very important aspect of the project as you have pointed out.</SimplePara>

                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: This might indeed be useful. However, the relevant time scales might be very different for chemistry at the local scale. Therefore one should be careful in just copying chemistry modules from other models. We look for fast chemistry modules that represent the (fast) local chemistry correctly. Besides we think that a thorough validation and careful testing is needed before implementing the system in a policy context.</SimplePara>
