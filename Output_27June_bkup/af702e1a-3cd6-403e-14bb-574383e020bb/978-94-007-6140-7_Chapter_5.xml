              <Para TextBreak="No">Population aging is a global phenomenon, which has already been experienced in the developed countries and is now being felt in the developing countries too. India is one among such countries which accommodates a large number of elderly. Given the projected duration of life in old age, the emerging concern relates to well-being in terms of freedom from disease and disability, which has implication not only for the individual but also for the household and society at large. The state of Kerala, which achieved below replacement level fertility much ahead of other Indian states, has the highest proportion of elderly. This proportion is going to increase from 10.6% in 2001 to 18.3% in 2026 (India, Registrar General <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2006</CitationRef>). This evident shift in the population structure indicates intense aging of the Kerala population, which, in turn, has considerable socio-economic implication, viz., meeting health needs and proper nutrition for the elderly, providing pensions and social security, etc. Different aspects of aging have been looked upon in case the of India, but the implication of aging on health expenditure has not been given due attention yet, in the case of either Kerala or India. On this account, this research proposes to attempt an exploration of the issue of population aging and its implications for health expenditure.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">There are ample evidences to suggest that the elderly are more likely to have health problems as compared to general population (Omran <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">1971</CitationRef>; Young <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">1997</CitationRef>; Wensing <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2001</CitationRef>; Prakash et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2004</CitationRef>; Bhatia et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2007</CitationRef>). Regardless of physical illness, the aged are more likely to have mental health problems, which arise from senility, neurosis and extent of life satisfaction (WHO <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">1989</CitationRef>). Mental disorders are due not just to brain aging, but also to the losses associated with the quality of life, and socio-economic problems are also responsible for advanced mental problems among the elderly (Prakash et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2004</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The high prevalence of health problems among the elderly has direct implication on health expenditure. As physical and mental health tends to deteriorate with age, the elderly need much more health care. In addition, the elderly often need medical care, which involves relatively expensive treatment and frequent hospitalisation. As a result, per capita health spending among the elderly is three to five times more than among the young population (Reinhardt <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2003</CitationRef>). Further, higher incidence of death due to the prevalence of more severe diseases increases health-related costs among the elderly. Seshamani and Gray (<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2003</CitationRef>) show that approaching death affects costs up to 15 years prior to death, and the health care cost increases ten times from 5 years prior to death. The concentration of medical care expenditure in the last years of life is also evident in particular disease categories such as heart disease and cancer (Riley et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">1987</CitationRef>). Studies also find rise in health expenditure in old age, primarily because mortality rates increase with age and health care expenditure increases with proximity to death (Yang et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2003</CitationRef>; Seshamani and Gray <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2004</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Growth in the elderly population in Kerala and prevalence of chronic diseases among the elderly raise concerns regarding the overall burden of care for those with physical and cognitive limitations and regarding the related health care costs. In the Indian context, sufficient evidence exists pertaining to the kind of deterioration in physical and mental health in old age (Gupta et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2001</CitationRef>; Irudaya Rajan <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2004</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2008</CitationRef>; Alam <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2008</CitationRef>), but, there is no systematic exploration regarding the burden of health expenditure that could arise due to the longer life span of the elderly with multiple chronic ailments. Kerala is selected for the analysis because it will be the first state to face the problem of aging<Footnote ID="Fn1">
                  <Para TextBreak="No">As per projection by census of India, the proportion of elderly in Kerala will rise from 10.6% in 2001 to 18.3% in 2026, which is more than all India and other Indian states’ corresponding figure (India, Registrar General <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>
                </Footnote> and hence it can be a wake-up call for the other Indian states. Another reason for selecting Kerala is the availability of state specific data from Migration Monitoring Study<Footnote ID="Fn2">
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Migration Monitoring Study (<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">2007</CitationRef>) is the third round of the Migration Monitoring Studies conducted by the Research Unit on International Migration of the Centre for Development Studies. Households were randomly selected from all the 14 districts and all the 63 taluks of the state. The thrust areas covered in the survey are migration, remittances and employment. This round of the survey is different from the previous rounds as it also covers topics like education and health, amenities in the households, possession of consumer durables, and household indebtedness.</Para>
                </Footnote> (<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">2007</CitationRef>) apart from NSSO, which gives more insight into the situation of the elderly in the state.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Given this background, the study seeks to examine how population aging affects health expenditure at the individual level and to estimate the cost of managing the diseases in future.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">This paper is divided into six sections. After the introduction in the first section, section “<InternalRef RefID="Sec2">Data Source and Methodology</InternalRef>” discusses the data source and methodology adopted in the study. Morbidity prevalence and cost of diseases are examined in section “<InternalRef RefID="Sec3">Description of Variables</InternalRef>” and “<InternalRef RefID="Sec4">Demographic Variables</InternalRef>”, respectively. Section “<InternalRef RefID="Sec5">Socio-Economic Variables</InternalRef>” discusses the regression result, and section “<InternalRef RefID="Sec6">Morbidity Prevalence and Health-Seeking Behaviour Among the Elderly</InternalRef>” concludes with some policy implications.</Para>

The survey randomly collected 10,000 sample households from all the 14 districts and all the 63 taluks of Kerala.</Para>
                </Footnote> conducted in Kerala. Life expectancy data has been taken from Sample Registration System (SRS) based abridged life table of <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">1992</CitationRef>–1996 and <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2002</CitationRef>–2006. NSS 60th Round and 52nd Round provides micro data on morbidity and health care of the whole population, including those aged 60 and above. The surveys of morbidity do not follow any uniform pattern, although objectives are the same, with slight differences in reference period, grouping of diseases, and source and type of treatment. Furthermore, these surveys covered various curative aspects such as utilization of health care services and the expenditure incurred by the households for availing these services. All information is collected for in-patients only, with a 365-day reference period for information for every event of hospitalization of each household member, whether living or deceased at the time of survey. Information on the condition of the elderly and the prevalence of ailments among them was also collected in the survey. Two-stage stratified sampling<Footnote ID="Fn6">

                <Para TextBreak="No">Household income is expected to affect the OOP expenditure on health care as it determines the household’s capacity to pay for health care without affecting the consumption of other necessities. Since NSSO does not provide data on income, consumption expenditure is taken as proxy of income. Based the consumption expenditure, consumption quintile is constructed. Health expenditure of the household in rural India is sensitive to changes in the household income levels (Mathiyazhagan <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2003</CitationRef>). The other variable that might affect health expenditure is education, which makes the individual more aware about health care and hence leads to reduction in OOP health expenditure (also termed as efficiency mechanism<Footnote ID="Fn11">

                  </Footnote>). Education also increases the opportunity cost of ill health, and educated people experience better health than those who are poorly educated (Ross and Wu <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">1995</CitationRef>).

Diseases are categorised into two categories – chronic and non-chronic. Chronic diseases are diseases that last for the longer duration. In the Indian context, social group is also an important variable that is likely to affect health expenditure. Social group is divided into three categories – scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, and others.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Before we examine the OOP health expenditure for the elderly, it is relevant to inspect morbidity prevalence among, as it has a direct implication for OOP health expenditure. Inter-state comparison has been done to show the relative health status of the elderly in Kerala.

                </Footnote> The figure reveals that life expectancy at 60 has increased for all India and all Indian states from 1995 to 1996 to 2004. It is interesting to note that the proportion of elderly reporting their health as poor is as high as 37% for Kerala, which is the highest among all Indian states (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">5.1</InternalRef>) in 2004. Kerala is followed by West Bengal and Orissa. It can also be noticed from the figure that the proportion of the elderly reporting their health as poor has increased for all India as well as for all Indian states except Himachal, Karnataka, Orissa, and Punjab from 1995 to 96 to 2004. This finding indicates that although life expectancy has improved, it has not been accompanied by good quality of life. Further disaggregation among the elderly suggests that the proportion of the elderly reporting their health as poor increases with the advancement of age (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab6">A.1</InternalRef>).

This may provide a clue as to whether the perceived health status reflects the observed ill health as indicated by the prevalence of various ailments among the elderly. Interestingly, the proportion of the elderly having at least one ailment is 59%, which is much higher than in the other Indian states and than the all India average. This result is quite interesting keeping in view the fact that Kerala has the highest life expectancy at birth and the third highest life expectancy at 60 in India (India, Registrar General <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2007b</CitationRef>). Like prevalence of at least one ailment, prevalence of at least two ailments and at least three ailments among the elderly is found to be highest in Kerala. Further, the results indicated that the prevalence of morbidity increases with the advancement of age.

              <Para TextBreak="No">Apart from the pattern of morbidity among the elderly and the non-elderly population in the state, morbidity from specific diseases is of greater interest in so far as the implications are concerned. Prevalence of disease pattern according to broad age groups in Kerala is shown in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">5.1</InternalRef>. It is evident that the prevalence of selected diseases does increase with advancing age and does intensify beyond the age of 60. Among the selected set of diseases, blood pressure and diabetes are the two diseases which commence early in life (about 30 years of age). Diseases listed in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">5.1</InternalRef> exhibit the systematic magnitude of intensification with age. Onset prior to the age of 60, coupled with long life expectancy in Kerala suggests rising cost of care relating to aging of the population in Kerala. The high prevalence of these diseases in persons aged 75 and above indicates a need for institutional care, which may add to the financial burden of such care in the state.

              <Para TextBreak="No">To formulate an idea regarding the approximate cost of care in accordance with the prevailing scenario of age and stage of diseases, there is a need to approximate an average age of persons with such diseases. For this purpose, mean age of onset of diseases has been calculated, which is shown in the Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">5.3</InternalRef>. It is clear that mean age of onset of most of the diseases is beyond 50, which indicates that people at higher age are more vulnerable to disease. Mean age of onset of diabetes and blood pressure is 59, which is higher than that of any other disease. It can also be noticed from the figure that there is not much difference in the mean age of onset of chronic diseases for males and females in the case of most of the diseases.

              <Para TextBreak="No">Following an understanding of the age pattern of disease prevalence in the state, it becomes pertinent to analyse the kind of care that individuals with different ailments seek. From Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">5.4</InternalRef>, it becomes very clear that most of the sick people in Kerala seek treatment; only 5% of the sick do not seek treatment. This observation suggests the existence of a well-developed medical system and the positive health-­conscious behaviour of people in the state. From the figure, it can also be noted that around 95% of people go to the doctor or health specialist for treatment. Not much gender difference is found in this treatment-seeking behavior.

              <Para TextBreak="No">Beyond the positive treatment-seeking behaviour, the study also examined the kind of medical institution preferred by the people. If more people are going to public hospitals, they are likely have relatively less income as compared to those who are going to private hospitals for treatment because private hospitals are mostly profit-motivated and hence, expensive. The type of hospital utilisation is shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig5">5.5</InternalRef>. The figure reveals that a majority of the elderly are going to government hospitals for treatment, which is in contrast with our previous findings from NSSO. The reason is likely that when the survey was conducted chickenguniya was widespread all over Kerala and the government hospitals played a major role in eradicating the menace, while private hospitals could not participate in an effective manner.

              <Para TextBreak="No">Following an understanding of morbidity prevalence and treatment-seeking behavior, it is also relevant to examine the cost of disease, as it has to be financed mostly by OOP expenditure in India, and this expenditure has a direct implication on household wellbeing. The table reveals that cancer is the most expensive disease (Rs. 764 per capita per month), which is followed by ‘kidney problem’ and ‘heart problem’. It was expected that the diseases would cost more at higher ages, but no definite pattern is found (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">5.2</InternalRef>). Nevertheless, it can be observed that the per capita cost of most of the diseases is higher for the 60–74 age group than the average cost for all ages for all ailments except cholesterol and asthma. These findings are well supported by the study of Zachariah and Irudaya Rajan (<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">2007</CitationRef>), in which the results were found to be similar.

              <Para TextBreak="No">To estimate the cost of managing diseases, hospitalisation rate is multiplied by the per capita out of pocket expenditure for in patient and the population in the contemporary period. Per capita out of pocket expenditure is estimated on the basis of compound growth rate observed between 1995 and 1996 and 2004 for estimating future cost. Hospitalisation rate and per capita OOP expenditure per year for 1995–1996 and 2004 are shown in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab3">5.3</InternalRef>. It is interesting to notice that hospitalisation rate of the elderly for chronic and non-chronic diseases has increased approximately four times and ten times, respectively. On the other hand, the rate has declined considerably for the non-elderly over a period of time, with an especially steep decline in the hospitalisation rate for non-chronic diseases. Per capita OOP expenditure per year has increased for both elderly and non-elderly in-patient treatment; it has increased from Rs. 4,425 in 1995–1996 to Rs. 5,236 for in-patient treatment of elderly persons for chronic diseases, while the same has increased from Rs. 2,660 to Rs. 3,349 in the respective year for non-chronic diseases. The per capita OOP expenditure for the non-elderly has increased from Rs. 4,791 and Rs. 2,565 in 1995–1996 to Rs. 5,569 and Rs. 4,547 for chronic and non-chronic diseases respectively. As revealed from the table, the elderly have a dual burden; (i) a higher rate of hospitalisation due to high morbidity prevalence, and (ii) an increased cost of hospitalisation. Because the cost of hospitalisation is much more for the elderly, the health of the elderly calls for more care and attention.

                  <Para TextBreak="No">It should be kept in mind that the same growth rate, which has been observed during 1995–1996 and 2004, is applied to estimate the cost of hospitalisation. Since the data on such costs is available for these two periods only, it is not possible to include more periods to make the estimation more robust. This is one of the major drawbacks of the study.</Para>
                </Footnote> Nonetheless, it should be noticed that the growth rate of hospitalisation for elderly is high; therefore if we project the hospitalisation at the same pace, it goes beyond the actual number of elderly. It should, however, be borne in mind that the rate of hospitalisation cannot go beyond a certain limit, and hence current hospitalisation rate (i.e. for 2004) has been taken for the projection of future cost. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab4">5.4</InternalRef> clearly reveals that the cost of managing the diseases will increase significantly from Rs. 4,662 million in 2004 to Rs. 11,948 million in 2026, out of which most of the increase will come from the increase in the cost of hospitalisation of the elderly. The OOP expenditure for elderly in-patient will constitute around 80% of the total OOP expenditure for all in-patients. These findings suggest that the high prevalence of morbidity among elderly is reflected in high health expenditure. It indicates that the elderly will face a dual burden of higher morbidity prevalence and high OOP health care expenditure. This result has significant bearing on public policy to finance such health expenditures in order to alleviate the economic burden of the elderly. It should also be observed that OOP expenditure for chronic diseases as well as non-chronic diseases will increase for both elderly and non-elderly persons, and the cost of non-chronic diseases is higher than the cost of chronic diseases.

              <Para TextBreak="No">The regression results (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab5">5.5</InternalRef>) show that all independent variables are significant at the 1% level of significance. As expected, per capita health expenditure (PCHE) of hospital in-patients is less for the individuals who chose public hospitals compared to those who chose private hospitals. Furthermore, health expenditure is less for illiterate persons, who are less likely to be conscious about their health and less likely to seek treatment. Types of disease also have significant effects on per capita health expenditures. The regression result clearly indicates that persons having chronic diseases are more likely to spend on health care as in-patients. The regression analysis further shows that sex is also an important determinant of health expenditure. Per capita health expenditure is likely to be less for males compared to females. Social group also has a substantial effect on PCHE. People categorized as SC and ST are likely to spend less compared to ‘others’,<Footnote ID="Fn14">
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Social group is categorized into three categories, ST, SC and others.</Para>
                </Footnote> who tend to be more well off compared to people in the ST and SC categories, and hence are likely to spend more on health care. Age is also an important factor affecting PCHE, as expected PCHE is found to be more for the elderly who are more prone to disease than people in the younger age groups. The regression results also indicate that consumption quintile, which has been taken as a proxy for income, is one of the major determinants of PCHE. People with the lowest income spend the least on health care, and people in quintile 2, quintile 3, and quintile 4 are also less likely to spend on health care compared to people in quintile 5.

              <Para TextBreak="No">The paper examined the effect of population aging on health expenditure in India, with specific reference to Kerala. An attempt was made to estimate the future cost of managing diseases. The proportion of the elderly reporting their health as poor is found to be highest in Kerala followed by West Bengal. Prevalence of at least one ailment is second highest in Kerala after Goa. These results are quite surprising as it is well known that Kerala is the most advanced state in India in terms of human development indicators.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">To devise an idea regarding the approximate cost of care in accordance with the prevailing scenario of age and stage of diseases, mean age of onset of diseases was calculated and the findings revealed the higher vulnerability of the elderly as the mean age of most of the diseases were found to be more than 50. OOP expenditure according to type of diseases (chronic and non-chronic diseases) was estimated in order to understand the burden according to the type of diseases, and the findings revealed that OOP expenditure was significantly higher for chronic diseases than for non-chronic diseases. Higher morbidity prevalence coupled with higher OOP expenditure among the elderly indicated that the elderly are the most vulnerable sections of the society and hence there is an urgent need for the insurance policies to be especially targeted towards the elderly. The comparative analysis of two rounds of NSSO revealed significant increase in hospitalisation rates as well as OOP expenditures for elderly in-patients. On the other hand, hospitalisation rates declined and OOP expenditure for non-elderly in-patients increased. OOP expenditures for in-patients are estimated to increase significantly from Rs. 1,745 million in 1996 to Rs. 11,948 million in 2026 (OOP expenditures for elderly in-patients are around 80% of the total OOP expenditure). This result has significant bearing on policy formulation, especially in terms of public finance, as the government devises health insurance plans to alleviate the burden of OOP expenditures on health care.</Para>
