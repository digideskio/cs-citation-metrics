              <Para>This paper reports optical, photo-acoustic and electrical switching investigations of GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript> amorphous thin films of different thicknesses, deposited on glass substrates in vacuum. The Tauc parameter (<Emphasis Type="Italic">B</Emphasis>

                <Subscript>U</Subscript>) have been determined from the transmittance spectra, to understand the changes in structural disorder; it is found that <Emphasis Type="Italic">B</Emphasis>

                <Subscript>U</Subscript> decreases as the thickness of the films increases. Based on the results, it is suggested that bond re-arrangement, i.e. transformation from homopolar bonds to heteropolar bonds, takes place with increase in thickness. The thermal diffusivity values of GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript> thin films also show the presence of a chemically ordered network in the GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript> thin films. Further, it is found that these films exhibit memory-type electrical switching. The observed variation in the switching voltages has been understood on the basis of increase in chemical order.</Para>

              <Para>Amorphous chalcogenides find applications in a variety of fields including phase-change memories, infrared optics, xerography etc. Studies of electrical, optical and thermal properties help us in identifying suitable samples for different applications. In particular, electrical switching studies of chalcogenide glasses have attracted intense investigations in recent times [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. There are studies of electrical, switching, thermal, optical and high-pressure behaviours of chalcogenide glassy semiconductors [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. Several sulphur-based glasses such as Ge<Subscript>46</Subscript>S<Subscript>54</Subscript>, GeS, As<Subscript>2</Subscript>S<Subscript>3</Subscript> etc. have been reported to exhibit interesting electrical properties including electrical switching [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. Particularly, sulphur-rich vacuum-evaporated Ge<Subscript>46</Subscript>S<Subscript>54</Subscript> thin films of thickness ranging from 123 to 370 nm have been found to exhibit memory-type electrical switching [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>Electrical switching exhibited by chalcogenide glasses [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>] is classified into reversible (threshold) and irreversible (memory) types of switching. While there is a school of thought suggesting that switching is essentially a thermal effect due to the formation of a hot filament in the electrode region [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>], there are also reports which suggest that switching is an entirely electronic phenomenon [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. It is now widely accepted that the initiation of switching in both threshold- and memory-type glasses is primarily electronic in nature and it occurs when the charged defect states are filled up by the field-injected charge carriers; however, additional thermal effects come into play in memory materials which result in the formation of a conducting crystalline channel between the electrodes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>The thermal properties like glass formability and thermal diffusivity are important factors for selecting a chalcogenide glass for phase change memory application based on the phenomenon of electrical switching [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. In particular, thermal diffusivity is an important parameter, as it determines the rate of periodic or transient heat propagation through a medium. The determination of thermal diffusivity is often necessary because of its major role in those phenomena controlled by thermal conduction, such as memory switching [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. Generally, photo-acoustic spectroscopy (PAS) is used to estimate the thermal diffusivity of bulk and thin-film chalcogenides [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. It is also found that there is a good correlation between thermal diffusivity and switching behaviour of chalcogenide glasses; chalcogenide glasses which have higher thermal diffusivity normally exhibit threshold-type electrical switching and those which have lower thermal diffusivity show memory behaviour [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. In a similar way, there is a correlation between optical properties and electrical switching behaviour of amorphous and glassy chalcogenides.</Para>
              <Para>In this work, thermal diffusivity measurements have been undertaken on amorphous GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript> thin films, using photo-acoustic spectroscopy. Further, studies of optical properties and electrical switching were carried out to understand the thickness-dependent properties of these thin films. Particularly, the Urbach energy and the Tauc parameter are estimated, which provide a better understanding of the mechanism of Urbach tail width [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>] and disorder effects [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>].</Para>

              <Para>Bulk GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript> glass was prepared from a stoichiometric mixture of high-purity elements (99.999 % HiMedia, India). The mixture was placed in a quartz ampoule and sealed under a vacuum of 10<Superscript>−5</Superscript> Torr. The ampoule was heated to 1000 °C and kept for 36 h inside a rotating furnace in order to ensure homogeneity of the melt. Bulk glassy ingots were obtained by quenching the ampoule in ice-cold water mixed with NaOH.</Para>
              <Para>Amorphous GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript> thin films were deposited from bulk glassy ingots, at a rate of 5 Å/s, by resistive evaporation, on cleaned glass substrates held at room temperature under a vacuum of 2×10<Superscript>−5</Superscript> Torr. Molybdenum boats were used for the evaporation of the material in a vacuum-deposition unit (HINDHIVAC 12A4D) attached to a quartz crystal thickness monitor. The thin films deposited on the glass substrates are of different thicknesses, namely 140, 310, 465, 623 and 781 nm, respectively. The thicknesses of the films were also confirmed using a surface roughness tester (SJ-210, Mitutoyo) and the average error bar was found to be ±3 %. For each thickness, two glass plates were deposited, one for switching studies using suitable masks and the other glass plate for various characterizations. The substrates were kept at a distance of 10 cm vertically above the source. During each deposition, the bulk material taken in the boat was completely evaporated at a fast rate so that no residual alloy remained from the previous deposition. It is worth mentioning here that each time fresh pieces of the alloy were used for the deposition of different thin films. This procedure is necessary to ensure homogeneity due to preferential evaporation of one of the components, the volatile sulphur.</Para>
              <Para>X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were carried out using an X’Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer with CuK<Subscript>

                </Subscript> radiation (<Emphasis Type="Italic">λ</Emphasis>=1.54 Å). The elemental compositions of these glasses were analyzed in a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM-FEI Quanta FEG 200) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) facility. The optical transmittance was obtained using a computerised double-beam UV-visible spectrophotometer (Techcomp model 2301) in the wavelength range from 300 to 1100 nm at room temperature.</Para>
              <Para>For switching devices, thin films were coated in a sandwich geometry using suitable masks with Al of thickness 100 nm as top and bottom electrodes (Al–GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript>–Al) (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>). The active area of the thin-film switching devices was about 5 mm×5 mm. The electrical switching behaviour was studied by recording the current–voltage (<Emphasis Type="Italic">I</Emphasis>–<Emphasis Type="Italic">V</Emphasis>) characteristics using a Keithley source meter (model 2410) controlled by LabVIEW (National Instruments). <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

The sample (film + substrate) was placed inside the photo-acoustic (PA) cell; the microphone was placed very close to the sample. To produce modulated light, a mechanical chopper (C-995, Tetrahertz Technologies Inc., USA) was used with the source. The photo-acoustic signal from the microphone wass fed to a lock-in amplifier (SR830 DSP, Stanford Research, USA). The photo-acoustic spectrometer had been indigenously integrated and automated with a PC for fast data acquisition and better accuracy. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig2">

                <Para>Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef> shows the transmittance spectra of as-deposited GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript> thin films. The film of thickness 140 nm does not show any interference pattern, whereas the number of interference fringes increases with increase of thickness from 310 to 781 nm. The film of 781 nm thickness shows an interference pattern with maxima at 605, 737 and 965 nm, while the corresponding minima are obtained at 658 and 832 nm, respectively. The interference patterns arise when the light is reflected from the top surface of the film and the bottom of the film, which confirms the formation of smooth and uniform films [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]. The number of interference fringes also increases with increase in thickness. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig4">

Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig5">5</InternalRef> shows the plot of (<Emphasis Type="Italic">αhυ</Emphasis>)<Superscript>1/2</Superscript> versus photon energy (<Emphasis Type="Italic">hυ</Emphasis>). The Tauc band gap is obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of this curve to the <Emphasis Type="Italic">x</Emphasis>-axis (Tauc extrapolation) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>] and the Tauc parameter (<Emphasis Type="Italic">B</Emphasis>
                  <Superscript>1/2</Superscript>) is determined from the slope; they are given in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">2</InternalRef>. The band gap of 2.483(1) eV obtained for the sample of thickness 140 nm is in good agreement with the literature values [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>]. From Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">2</InternalRef> it is found that the band gap energy decreases with increase in thickness for GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript> thin films. The decrease in optical band gap can be explained by using the ‘density of states model’ proposed by Mott and Davis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>], which suggests that the width of the localized states near the mobility edges is dependent on the degree of disorder and defects present in the amorphous structure. It is well understood that unsaturated (homopolar) bonds along with some saturated (heteropolar) bonds are produced during the deposition of amorphous films [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>]. These unsaturated bonds are also responsible for the creation of defects in the film with low thickness of about 140 nm, which produce localized states in amorphous systems [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>]. Therefore, the observed decrease in optical band gap with increase in the thickness in the present GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript> amorphous thin films may be due to the presence of a high concentration of localized states in the band structure. In an amorphous or structurally disordered film, the imperfection causes the bands of localized states to broaden, and consequently a band gap reduction may occur with increase in thickness due to the Urbach edge [<CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>]. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig5">

                  <Superscript>1/2</Superscript> value for the film of 140 nm is 175 (cm<Superscript>−1/2</Superscript> eV<Superscript>−1/2</Superscript>) and that for the film of 781 nm is 266 (cm<Superscript>−1/2</Superscript> eV<Superscript>−1/2</Superscript>). The increase in the Tauc parameter with increase in thickness provides a clue that the level of ordering in oriented chains is higher when the film thickness is increased. The Tauc parameter increases monotonically with thickness, which indicates that the thicker the film, the smaller the effect of the disorder. Here, the disorder refers to the electronic states within the material as compared to the irregularities in the atomic arrangement [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>]. The increase in film thickness leads to an increased ordering in oriented chains [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>]. The Urbach energies found for the 140 and 781 nm films are 0.648 and 0.433 eV, respectively. This relatively high value of <Emphasis Type="Italic">E</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>U</Subscript> for the lower thickness films can be attributed to the presence of homopolar bonds like Ge–Ge and S–S [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>]. Materials with larger Urbach energy would have a greater tendency to convert weak bonds into defects [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>]. When the thickness increases from 140 to 781 nm, the heteropolar bonds like Ge–S (53.5 kcal/mol) are expected to form in large numbers due to the greater bond strength compared to those of Ge–Ge (37.6 kcal/mol) and S–S (50.90 kcal/mol) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>]. It is seen from Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">2</InternalRef> that there is a decrease in <Emphasis Type="Italic">E</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>U</Subscript> with increase in thickness due to greater structural stability of the glassy system. The film of thickness 781 nm shows a higher value of <Emphasis Type="Italic">B</Emphasis>

                <Para>As the thickness of GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript> thin films increases from 140 to 781 nm, the thermal diffusivity is also found to increase from 0.095×10<Superscript>−9</Superscript> to 3.529×10<Superscript>−9</Superscript> m<Superscript>2</Superscript>/s. In the PAS technique, the thin-film sample absorbs light and generates photo-carriers. These excess photo-carriers diffuse through the sample and generate heat. The PA signal is mainly dependent on this heat generation. It is well known that the thermal conductivity of a solid is due to the heat transport by both phonons and carriers [<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef>]. The increase in thermal diffusivity with thickness may be attributed to the changes in the short-range order taking place in the amorphous network with the increase in the concentration of Ge. As the concentration of Ge atoms increases with thickness, the sulphur-atom chains become increasingly cross linked by Ge atoms. As a result, a stable structure consisting of GeS<Subscript>4</Subscript> tetrahedral units is formed for the highly ordered film of 781 nm with Ge–S bonds having higher bond energy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. Usually, chalcogenide glasses which have a higher thermal diffusivity exhibit threshold-type electrical switching and those which have a lower thermal diffusivity show memory behaviour. The comparatively lower thermal diffusivity value of GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript> glasses is consistent with their memory behaviour [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>].</Para>

At point (a), there is a sudden drop in voltage and the switching occurs along the load line (ab), leading to the ON state. As the transition to the ON state is very fast, no data points can be observed in this range (ab). Any further increase in the applied current does not produce any significant increase in the potential drop across the sample (part (bc) of the curve representing the ON state with low resistance). On decreasing the applied current, the voltage decreases to zero value along the path (co) of the curve.

                <Para>It is seen from Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig7">7</InternalRef> that the film exhibits three states, namely the OFF state with high resistance, a current-controlled negative-resistance (CCNA) state above the threshold voltage (<Emphasis Type="Italic">V</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>T</Subscript>) and the ON state with low resistance. Here, the negative-resistance region leads to the low-resistance ON state and once the device becomes latched to the ON state, it does not revert back to the initial high-resistance state even if the applied current is reduced to zero. This clearly indicates that GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript> thin films exhibit memory switching behaviour. A similar memory type of switching behaviour has been seen in Ge–Te–Se and Ge–Te–Sn thin-film samples also [<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">39</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR40">40</CitationRef>]. It is also found that samples of thicknesses 140 and 623 nm do not exhibit switching and exhibited sparking at the electrode region. Similar behaviour of sparking during switching has been reported earlier in Ge<Subscript>

                  </Subscript> amorphous films [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>] also. The observed behaviour has been attributed to an abrupt increase in current, which causes an adiabatic heating of the active material to near-melting temperatures. This causes the partial splashing of the active material in the switched zone, which quickly resolidifies in the amorphous state [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>]. For the films of thickness 310, 465 and 781 nm, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">I</Emphasis>–<Emphasis Type="Italic">V</Emphasis> characteristics are measured at different points throughout the surface of the film, and the mean value of the threshold voltage (<Emphasis Type="Italic">V</Emphasis>
                  <Subscript>T</Subscript>) has been found as 10.126, 7.483 and 0.048 V, respectively.</Para>
                <Para>The memory switching is a consequence of a phase transition in the material from the amorphous to the crystalline state [<CitationRef CitationID="CR42">42</CitationRef>]. The films of thickness 310, 465 and 781 nm show resistances of the order of several MΩ before switching. Since the films are deposited at room temperature and no further heat treatment followed, the initial state of the prepared films is amorphous (high-resistivity OFF state) in nature. Initially, a small amount of current is applied and with that there is an increase in voltage. When the voltage reaches the threshold/switching voltage (≈10.13 V) (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig7">7</InternalRef>a), the current is found to increase drastically due to switching. During switching, the electrical resistivity of the device is drastically reduced (several ohms) as the charge-defect states are fully filled by the field-injected charge carriers. With the sudden increase in current after the initiation of switching, there is large adiabatic Joule heating which suddenly raises the temperature at the electrode and causes the material to crystallize [<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>], setting the film permanently in the ON state [<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>In the present GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript> thin films, it may be reasonable to assume that the role of thermal processes is extensive and is responsible for the memory switching. As mentioned earlier, with the increase in film thickness, a reorganization in the glassy network takes place and more heteropolar bond formation may occur making the network highly ordered. This could be a reason for the observed change in the switching voltages. This observation is consistent with the variation in Tauc parameter and Urbach energy, which suggests the formation of heteropolar bonds with increase in thickness.</Para>

              <Para>GeS<Subscript>2</Subscript> thin films were thermally evaporated on glass substrates. The effect of thickness on the switching phenomenon, Tauc parameter, Urbach energy, band gap and thermal diffusivity has been studied. The band gap energies were estimated and found to decrease with increase in film thickness. The width of the Urbach energy was determined and related to the disorder in the prepared films. The width of the Urbach energy was found to decrease with increase in film thickness, which indicates that the higher thickness films are more ordered. The prepared films are found to exhibit memory-type electrical switching behaviour.</Para>
