          <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Many products from agricultural small-scale producers’ land holdings in Southern Africa include products such as medicinal products extracted from leaves, tree barks and roots; beehives crafted from tree barks, a range of vegetables, a range of pulses including cowpeas and beans as well as a range of grains and wild fruits. Dry lands are known for their richness of tree species with edible fruits. The tree species with edible fruits increase with mean annual rainfall. Where there is adequate rain, fruit production spans the whole year but most abundant production occurs during the rainy season whenever heavy rainfall is received. The fruits provide a significant source of nutrition particularly during the dry season. Poorer households also harvest and sell these wild fruits to derive much needed income. Some studies have revealed that for such households the income from the selling of such fruits is higher than that from animal husbandry or arable agriculture (Van Wyk and Gericke <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">2000</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The inhabitants of the dry lands in Southern Africa have a rich heritage of ably managing and living harmoniously with their environment utilizing resources wisely stretching these from years of abundance into lean years. Many years of experience and folklore handed down over generations had equipped these people with viable adaptations to the harsh environment. Long traditional survival techniques included livestock rearing, keeping a few cattle and mostly small stock such as goats and sheep. They harvested wildlife, wild fruits and vegetables to augment those they kept and/or cultivated. In many instances, perennial indigenous tree crops perform better than exotic species. Many indigenous fruit species available in the dry lands of Southern Africa are reported to contain higher levels of vitamins and minerals than domesticated species (Shackleton and Clarke <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2007</CitationRef>). Currently, small stock still predominates while cattle are kept for milk and for sale as well as meeting cultural and traditional ceremonial needs.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">However, across Southern Africa, the agricultural small-scale producers’ survival techniques have been weakened by introduced medicine, veterinary services and other western lifestyles. While these are viewed as ‘development’ by many, their impacts on the livelihoods of the dry lands inhabitants is a far cry from ‘development’. Increasing populations of people and animals due to introduced health services and veterinary medicine have led to increasing demand for all natural resources including water which far exceeds readily available supply. Numerous projects which tout ‘wise use, sustainable management and conservation’ have been introduced and implemented in some of the areas. Many water resource development projects have been built to provide more dependable water supplies for man and his livestock, wild animals as well as limited agricultural projects. Additionally, expansive cultivated areas and large ranches owned by commercial farmers depending on groundwater and small earth dams which produce for export particularly in South Africa, Swaziland and to a lesser extent Namibia and Zimbabwe have also been implemented. Yet, the sustainability of some of these undertakings remains questionable as boreholes have dried, earth dams have silted up and residents have been left in limbo when donor funding ended. In many instances, projects which could be termed ‘white’ elephants are a common feature across Southern Africa.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">There has been great deterioration of environmental health of some parts where agricultural activities which symbolize ‘development of the rural areas’ due to the creation of habitats which have increased hazards and risks facing these small-scale producers. Experience has shown that inappropriate harnessing of water resource has resulted in the emergence of insect borne diseases such as malaria, bilharzias, trypanosomiasis and river blindness. The abundant vegetation that characterises the surrounding areas of dams and other water impoundments provide ideal habitats for the vectors that cause these debilitating diseases. Limiting or even forbidding the use of bush fires which were used by the herders to control ticks and other unwanted parasites for livestock have created new threats to the pastoralist’s livestock. The recent introductions of pesticides (herbicides, insecticides, fungicides) in rural areas have generated a number of threats to the environment just like heavy metals (e.g. arsenic, selenium) resulting from the development of wastes containing these products in rural areas pose contamination threats to crops and livestock. Some soil alterations caused by recycled city wastes, wastes from agro-industries, and local rock phosphates have been noted in some areas used by the small-scale producers.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Other threats to the environment emanate from increased production of staple foods such as cassava which generate cyanide from cassava cyanogens (linamarin, cyanohydrins and hydrogen cyanide). Accumulation of these wastes in the environment leads to pollution of rivers and accumulation in aquatic species such as fish. Linked to cassava processing are the cassava peels which are sometimes used as animal feed but sometimes the peels accumulate to such an extent that they are a menace to the surrounding environment. The peels become more hazardous when they start decomposing as hydrogen cyanide and other gases are released to the atmosphere leading to choking and obnoxious smell. Similarly some locally small-scale processing of agricultural products such as Gossypol from cotton oil set ups and fermentation vinasses from the sugarcane factories is documented to have generated hazards to the environment. Thus there is need to pay greater attention to the impacts of activities grouped together as ‘development’ in the areas inhabited by small-scale producers.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">A worrying realization is that even programs that entail expansion of production of basic agricultural commodities might be accompanied by unsystematic expansion of acreage under cultivation or by the arbitrary application of modern production practices, including fertilizers and other modern amenities without due consideration to recognized standards for health and environmental safety. Much of these were observed and/or recorded in the sugar and citrus industry where local small-scale producers who are somehow linked to international markets are often unaware of safety standards and therefore are forced to compromise on quality with adverse consequences. While generally agriculture reduces the biodiversity of a given land as it alters the habitat of fauna and flora, mono cropping system such as sugar cane growing is particularly bad in this regard. Thus mitigations for introduced activities such as outlay sugar cane growing as part of commercial farms should look into probable threats to the environment including the hazards associated with inputs such as agro-chemicals used to obtain higher yields. Linked to this is the danger of increased severity of biodiversity decline and the ravages of pests and diseases as a result of changing weather patterns and subsequent climate change.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Loss of biodiversity emanates from uniformed agricultural small-scale producers’ practices including bush and forest clearing to increase production required to meet developmental goals and targets. These demands for increased outputs are often not linked with necessary education, training and awareness building among the small-scale producers which would give them an understanding of the needs as well as the importance of balancing between the tonnage increase and the ecosystem. The training should include aspects such as raising environmental awareness; imparting environmental knowledge; (i.e. a basic understanding of how the environment functions, the role people play in the environment and how issues and problems with the environment arise). Changing attitude geared towards helping the agricultural small-scale producers to enhance their sense of responsibility and concern with regards to the environment and to motivate them to act more responsibly to conserve environmental quality is often absent in these expectations. Absent also are skills packaging to enable the small-scale producers appreciate and identify the issues that may impact the environment both positively and negatively.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">For example, agricultural small-scale producers should be made aware of agroforestry advantages where legume trees are planted in the fields to improve soil fertility and reduce use of large quantities of inorganic fertilizers that might be leached into the underground water and contaminate the drinking water in the wells. The small-scale growers who would otherwise abandon their old food crop farms to open new fields in the existing forests would be encouraged to maintain their old fields because the soils would be rejuvenated through agroforestry and would remain productive particularly when combined with the use of inorganic fertilizers. As a spin off, the agroforestry trees also would provide fuel wood that would help reduce harvesting trees from natural forests thus curbing land degradation and promoting sustainability in small-scale agriculture (Leakey et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Meanwhile, throughout Southern Africa dry lands, agricultural small-scale producers struggle to meet their subsistence needs as well as produce for the world market economy including materials needed by a wide range of industries located in the developed countries (e.g. tobacco, fruits and cut flowers). For these agricultural small-scale producers, irrigation is not often an option; rather rain fed agriculture is the norm. To ensure success where limited irrigation is practiced, it is desirable that social attitudes be reoriented through education, campaigns and awareness building so that communities are able to appreciate the implications of over utilization of natural resources against ever escalating demands.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Climate change being experienced by the rest of Africa is also affecting Southern Africa where it has caused an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme events as well as gradual changes in the rainfall and temperature patterns. Southern Africa is faced by a number of weather and climate-related anomalies including cyclones, floods and droughts. The impacts and losses caused by such events are catastrophic due to poor infrastructure and low technology inherent in large parts of the region particularly the dry parts. Many communities among the agricultural small-scale producers are very vulnerable to these climatic vagaries as they possess little capacity to prepare for and recover from such natural calamities. It is also important to relate how climate change related stress interacts with other existing stressing factors to worsen vulnerability. For example how climate change related factors are combining with impacts of existing aridity on agricultural livelihoods and food security.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">This scenario requires intervention in building capacity to respond to and plan for these emerging threats in the region. In Mozambique for example, the focus is still largely on disaster management, having suffered immensely from cyclone events and flooding in recent years. In Malawi the impacts of flooding and droughts on agricultural livelihoods are compounded by widespread deforestation and HIV prevalence, limiting the implementation of existing coping strategies during times of crop failure and food insecurity, such as collecting wild foods and charcoal production. In some of the other countries, communities plagued interchangeably by periodic flooding and droughts have acknowledged a shift in weather patterns over recent decades (for example changes in the timing of the rainy season) that have negatively impacted water availability and agricultural production. For example in Namibia, a largely dry country, recent years have seen floods with increased magnitude to the extent that large numbers of people are displaced and have to be accommodated and fed in relief camps, a new phenomenon in the country; droughts have also become more intense to necessitate countrywide relief food.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Engaging in old traditional survival techniques is among the activities that serve as fall back for agricultural small-scale producers during the harsh times. Activities such as wild fruit collection, rudimentary processing and marketing as well as bush meat and vegetables harvesting support some of these communities during lean times (Campbell and Brigham <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">1993</CitationRef>). Recent interventions that borrow from the traditional coping strategies include indigenous tree domestication to increase sustainability of fruit supply. Exotic fruit trees have also been introduced in some areas to strengthen the food base for these producers who largely depend directly on their natural environment (Akinnifesi et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2006</CitationRef>). It is common to find both exotic as well as indigenous fruit trees in the areas inhabited by small-scale producers growing naturally or grown in farms and around homesteads. Exotic fruit trees include pawpaw, apple and pear trees, dates, orange, lime and lemon trees as well as kiwi, mango and avocado trees. Indigenous fruit tree species include <Emphasis Type="Italic">Adansonia digitata; Azanza garckeana; Diospyros; Ficus; Uapaca and Ximenia; Vitellaria Paradoxa; Parkia biglobosa; Tamarindus indica, Ziziphus mauritiana and Sclerocarya birrea</Emphasis> (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Amarula tree</Emphasis>)<Emphasis Type="Italic">.</Emphasis>
          </Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">
            <Emphasis Type="Italic">Amarula</Emphasis> fruit from the <Emphasis Type="Italic">amarula</Emphasis> tree (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Sclerocarya birrea</Emphasis>) is widely distributed in the semi-arid areas in Southern Africa including in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Mozambique. The tree is also found in other areas outside Southern Africa including Eastern Africa and Sahel countries. Others such as <Emphasis Type="Italic">Uapaca kirkiana</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Azanza garckeana</Emphasis> are widely distributed in the miombo woodlands and semi-arid areas in Southern Africa. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Amarula</Emphasis> flesh is very rich in Vitamin C as well while the kernel is rich in oil similar to olive oil (+50 % oil); it is used as food during drought periods, sundried fruit, processed into jams, juices and jelly. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Amarula</Emphasis> is also used to produce alcoholic beverages (liqueur and cider) among which the <Emphasis Type="Italic">amarula</Emphasis> cream from South Africa is the most famous. Baobab fruit (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Adansonia digitata</Emphasis>) has many uses including making juices which are rich in Vitamin C and B-complex plus other minerals. Communities living along the Zambezi valley depend on indigenous fruits to supplement their diets even during times outside droughts and famine periods (about 42 % of natural food basket) and in South Africa indigenous fruits are consumed and processed into juices, jams, drinks and liqueur (e.g. <Emphasis Type="Italic">amarula</Emphasis> cream which trades internationally).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Traditionally, agricultural small-scale producers across Southern Africa often retained and protected indigenous fruit trees in their fields; abundant evidence exists in most Southern Africa countries including Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, South Africa and Namibia. Historically, rural folks relied on wild vegetables and wild fruit collection for food particularly for local beer brewing. Therefore up to the present time, apart from serving as a fall back source of food during hard times, some of these fruits and nuts remain important cash crops. Fruits and nuts contribute towards improving social and economic benefits to the livelihoods of small-scale producers in the rural areas as food, health care and income generation. In some places these trees are used to determine where to site a homestead while many households plant these trees within their homesteads or within the arable fields or along field boundaries. Fruit trees within homesteads or in the arable fields often record higher yields than those growing wild in the woodlands probably due to less competition or due to fertilizers and manure applied to the crop fields or due to manure and watering taking place within the homesteads.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It is common knowledge that trees have very positive impact on water conservation as they increase infiltration and ground water recharge. Clustered trees that form forests and woodlands are also carbon dioxide sinks which lowers the rate of global warming and thus climate change whose impacts are negatively affecting the Southern Africa region. The future and sustainability of fruit trees as a source of food security and environmental conservation lies in research looking into conservation and/or domestication of the indigenous fruit trees. Concerted efforts towards indigenous tree domestication started way back in 1986 when the International Center for Research on Agroforestry (ICRAF) now the World Agroforestry Center embarked on efforts to domesticate some of the indigenous fruit tree species. The indigenous tree domestication started as a participatory venture involving the local communities as a farmer-driven and market-led process. Fruit tree domestication has now become a very popular internationally supported initiative geared towards commercialization of indigenous fruit tree products throughout Southern Africa. The species included in the domestication process include <Emphasis Type="Italic">Uapaca Kirkiana, Stryschnos Cocculoides, Parinari Curatellifolia, Sclerrocarya Birrea, Vangueria infausta, zizfus mauritiana, Adansonia digitata, Syzigium cordatum and Vitex</Emphasis> species.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Domestication of indigenous fruit trees embraces a participatory approach which supplements the more traditional aspects of tree improvements. It is seen as an important strategy towards achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs) of eradicating poverty and hunger, promoting social equity and environmental sustainability. Tree domestication is aimed at promoting the cultivation of indigenous trees with economic potential as new cash crops. Improved productivity and quality of the products through value addition to indigenous fruits ensures markets and higher incomes which go a long way towards reinforcing food security and reducing poverty among small-scale producer communities.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Results indicate that the species with long maturity periods can be domesticated through various vegetative propagation methods and thus increase productivity to improve diets, nutrition and raise the living standards of the small-scale producers. Domestication of indigenous trees uses two approaches: forestry and horticulture-based approaches. The forestry approach is disadvantaged by the fact that it takes a substantially long period to come up with the most viable cultivar in long-lived perennial species. The horticulture approach on the other hand captures superior genetic variants through vegetative (asexual) propagation. It is documented as being faster than the forestry approach.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Several challenges face this initiative the main one being that large chunks of land fall under the communal land tenure system. Indigenous trees growing in these lands are treated as open access goods available to anyone. Everybody has access and has the right to harvest yet no one is accountable to the management of the trees. Other challenges that threaten the sustainability of indigenous fruit trees products is low demand and lack of reliable markets for indigenous fruits either due to historical factors where such fruits were not accorded high values like exotic fruits or because locally the fruits were a common good and their availability and significance were taken for granted. The nutritional value was not known and the colonial masters undervalued and looked down on the fruits as inferior more out of ignorance than scientific data. Under such conditions, the local people did not see the necessity of caring for the trees and sometimes the need to plant new trees until ICRAF and other research organizations embarked on initiatives of awareness building and value addition as well as scoping for markets for the products.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">More challenges arise from the bulkiness and perishableness of the ripe fruits made worse by lack of suitable skills on packaging and preservation methods and the short period within which these fruits are available as well as the low demand by local markets. Lack of reliable transportation system to distant markets predominantly in urban centers further disadvantages the distribution of these products. While products such as locally produced alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks; liqueurs, traditional beer and wines, jams, juices, concentrates, confectionaries are slowly but increasingly entering the local and international commercial markets, they are facing stiff competition from more preferred imported exotic products.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Besides fruit tree domestication by the World Agroforestry Center, individual countries in Southern Africa are also making efforts directed towards conservation of indigenous tree and other plant resources as well as in promoting the use and value addition to these indigenous resources.</Para>

          <Heading>Namibia</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Namibia, a large country (823,680 km<Superscript>2</Superscript>) with a coastline 1,440 km long, is located on the west coast of the Southern Africa sub-continent (Fig. <ExternalRef>
              <RefSource>3.1</RefSource>
              <RefTarget Address="10.1007/978-3-319-09495-3_3#Fig1" TargetType="DOI"/>
            </ExternalRef>). Namibia is a dry country with very limited water resources; its climate is second in aridity to that of the Sahara. The rainfall is variable, unpredictable and unreliable; it varies between 20 mm along the west coast to more than 850 mm in the extreme northeast. The rainfall occurs mainly during summer months for most parts of the country, the south-western part receiving winter rainfall. Summer rain is subject to very high evaporation rates; the average evaporation rate for the country being 2,500 mm in the northwest and 3,700 mm in the southeast (Msangi <CitationRef CitationID="CR023">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Namibia’s climate is highly variable and difficult to understand. It is a direct interplay of various factors including its relative location on the south-western part of the Africa continent, spanning a zone between 17° and 29° south of the equator. Thus Namibia is exposed to air movements driven by three major climatic systems. The Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) feeds in moisture laden air from the north while the Sub-tropical High Pressure System positioned across the country pushes the moist air back with dry cold air. The effect of this system is more pronounced than that of the ITCZ so that Namibia is characterized by dry hot weather for most of the year. The Temperate System to the south of the country with predominantly moisture laden westerly winds which carry a succession of low pressure systems and cold fronts from west to east feeding bursts of cold air from the Antarctic sweep across Southern Africa during southern hemisphere winter. It brings some moisture to the south-western part of Namibia. These three systems move south and northwards in response to the overhead sun (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">4.1</InternalRef>).

The cold Benguela current cools the easterly flowing air stream from below occasioning fog formation along the coast extending to about 100 km inland. No clouds form and therefore most years pass without rain in this part of the country. The mountain range along the south-eastern coast of Southern Africa force moist airstreams to rise, condense and drop most of the moisture on its eastern side descending as dry air on the mountains’ western side reaching Namibia as dry airstreams; thus the presence of the Kalahari desert on the eastern part of Namibia.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Although known to be hot and dry for most of the year, Namibia’s climate is highly variable. Temperatures and rainfall vary greatly over space and time, variability being compounded by the shifts in the relative position of the three major climatic systems. Temperatures are usually very high for most part of the year (in the mid and upper 30 °C reaching 40–44 °C in the northern and southern part of the country as well as over the Namib desert only cooling off during the short winter period. Winds blow strongly for most part of the year being strongest along the coast where dry hot sand-laden winds fill up hand dug wells and compounding difficulties and risks facing agricultural small-scale producer communities dependent on natural resources exploitation for their livelihood.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Only 2 % of Namibia’s land receives sufficient rainfall to grow crops. As all inland rivers are seasonal, irrigation is only possible in the valleys of the Border Rivers (Orange, Kunene and Okavango) as well as at man-made dams (Hardap and Naute dams). Forty-one percent of the land is under communal tenure while 44 % is under commercial farms. The rest is pure desert which does not support any form of agriculture. Although Namibian agriculture, (excluding fishing) contributed between 5 % and 6 % of Namibia’s GDP from 2004 to 2009, a large percentage of the Namibian population depends on agricultural activities for their livelihood, mostly small-scale subsistence farming (Lwasa et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR0001">2013</CitationRef>). Subsistence farming is mainly confined to Namibia’s “communal lands”. In the communal lands of the north, roaming cattle herds and small stock are prevalent pearl millet, sorghum, corn, pulses and peanuts are grown to supplement diets and incomes. The southern communal lands are predominantly used for subsistence rearing of small stock such as goats and sheep. For the agricultural small-scale producers, small stock rearing forms the back bone of their day to day survival and hence their food security greatly depends on this as well as on their indigenous technical knowledge on the utilization of indigenous plant resources (Bennett <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In Namibia research and case studies have been initiated by the Research and Training Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry in attempting to realize the goal of conserving indigenous trees and other plant resources as well as in promoting the use and value addition to these indigenous resources. Namibia’s initial step comprised capturing and documenting information from the communities on the type and use made of indigenous plant resources to be followed by research on viable methods in value addition, storage and marketing of the products other than those identified by the communities. The purpose of the initial case study was to identify and gauge the role that indigenous plant resources play in enhancing food security of the agricultural small-scale producers in Namibia. This case study titled “The role of indigenous plant resources in fortifying food security and rural livelihoods in Namibia” by Ipinge SNA, Shiningavamwe KL &amp; Shindume FN as edited and updated by Msangi, JP is presented here below.</Para>

          <Heading>Introductory Observations</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Namibia is endowed with a variety of indigenous plant resources (IPRs) which play significant roles in alleviating poverty and form reliable supplementary food source especially during lean times such as during droughts. Equally, these IPRs also serve as a source of small income for many agricultural small-scale producers. Fruits and other IPRs derived products are traded at both informal and formal markets. Since time immemorial, rural communities in Namibia have been using these IPRs as sources of nutritious food and medicine for people and their animals. These IPRs are also a source of income and inputs into their cultural practices and ceremonies. Over the years, communities have accumulated a considerable sound indigenous technical knowledge and understanding on the utilization of these IPRs. With the move to process and manufacture natural products based commodities such as perfume and liqueur, opportunities have been created for agricultural small-scale producers to take advantage of and improve their livelihoods from these resources.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In quest to diversify livelihoods of the rural population, the government of Namibia resolved to explore the inherent potential of indigenous plant resources in poverty alleviation and income generation. Consequently the Directorate of Agricultural Research and Training in the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry was tasked with the responsibility of conducting the initial field survey to document indigenous technical knowledge and usage of indigenous plant resources as well as the role they play in day to day life of the agricultural small-scale producers in the country. A task team (Indigenous Plant Task Team-IPTT) was constituted to survey and document the roles of IPRs in stabilizing food security and suggest ways of optimizing their utilization through appropriate value addition and marketing. The team developed and administered a questionnaire survey in 11 of the 13 political regions during 2010/2011 season seeking to look into ways of promoting sustainable use of indigenous plants for a greater household food security, agricultural diversification, income generation, employment and diversification of livelihood opportunities as well as agro-industry development. The questionnaire survey was designed to capture and document all the information still available among the rural people and subsequently fill in any identified gaps and suggest recommendations on the way forward. Prior to administering the questionnaire, the task team consulted relevant literature on the subject particularly that pertaining to biological resources utilization and their conservation.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Furthermore, recognizing that one cannot talk about value of indigenous plant resources in human terms without falling back to what people know and how they utilize these resources and that indigenous technical knowledge in Namibia is largely derived through oral traditions passed on down generations, it became imperative that there is a possibility of losing some information during the relay process. Thus, on this basis, the government established broad based Stakeholders Working Groups and Task Teams including Indigenous Plant Task Team (IPTT); Hoodia Working Group (HWG) and Devil’s Claw Working Group (DCWG and tasked them develop a coordinated approach and strategy for the implementation of an economically sustainable utilization and promotion of indigenous plant based products in Namibia.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The Indigenous Plants Task Team (IPTT), a multi-stakeholder team, was tasked with developing a coordinated approach that would promote strategies for the documentation of indigenous plant resources. The task team was also tasked with coming up with implementation strategies that would contribute towards economically sustainable promotion and utilization of indigenous plant resources for greater household food security, agricultural diversification, income generation, employment and livelihood opportunities creation as well as agro-industrial development. The task team came up with priorities and activities that would promote the commercial use of indigenous plant resources while respecting indigenous technical knowledge. IPRs are considered as an important aspect in the lives of the small-scale producers in rural Namibia. A considerable number of Namibian women and youth groups and co-operatives derive their livelihoods from indigenous plants and plant products. Examples of these groups include Eudafano Women Co-operative (EWC); King Nehale Community Resource Trust (KNCRT); Tulongeni Twa Hangana (TTH); Topnaar Foundation; Omaheke San Trust and many others.</Para>

          <Heading>Literature Review</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) recognizes the “close and traditional dependence of many indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles on biological resources”. Further, the convention requires that national governments, subject to their national legislations, “respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity”. The CBD further recommends that national governments recognize and involve the holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices while formulating use and conservation of biological resources; it encourages equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge, innovations and practices” (CBD <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">1992</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Since time immemorial, people on all continents have utilized indigenous plants for a variety of reasons (Bosze <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2000</CitationRef>). Balick and Cox (<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">1996</CitationRef>) argue that many plant derived drugs used in modern medicine today were originally discovered through indigenous technical knowledge systems. Good examples include the quinine tablets used in the treatment of malaria; a celebrated medical breakthrough sourced from the bark of the indigenous Cinchona tree (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Cinchona pubescens</Emphasis>) which the Peruvian Indians have used to treat fevers for many centuries and the Malagasy rosy periwinkle used for the treatment of childhood leukemia. There is enough documented evidence from all continents to indicate that the use of plants for varieties of reasons including medicinal purposes has been practiced since the days when man settled on planet earth.

          <Para TextBreak="No">Like in many other countries in the world, indigenous plant resources play a crucial role in the social fabric of both rural and urban small-scale economies in Namibia. The importance of indigenous plant resources’ availability for gift giving and social interaction is surmountable as IPRs are intricately intertwined in the agricultural small-scale producers’ everyday lives. This is consistent with some authors who argue that the knowledge base acquired by the indigenous and local people over many hundreds of years was through direct contact with their environment. Such knowledge includes an intimate and detailed knowledge of plants, animals and natural phenomena, the development and use of appropriate technologies for hunting, fishing, trapping, agriculture and forestry coupled with a holistic knowledge or a world view which parallels the scientific discipline of ecology (Inglis <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">1993</CitationRef>, p. VI).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Sustainable development depends on successfully addressing the twin challenges of poverty and environmental degradation. It is an approach to productive reorganization that encompasses the combined experiences of all relevant stakeholders and all sectors in any given country (<ExternalRef>

            </ExternalRef>). The opportunities rural small-scale producers can derive from IPRs are many and varied. With the world trend of moving towards the use of natural products from IPRs, there are wide opportunities these producers can take advantages of to generate additional income. In this connection, the IPRs serve as a source of employment or basis for business opportunities that take advantage of local and international markets. Increasingly, fruit species are traded at both informal and formal markets (Lusepani-Kamwi <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2003</CitationRef>, p. 22).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Different stakeholders and institutions are playing an important role in developing and encouraging sustainable use of the indigenous plants and their products. This is done through the back-up of the concept of sustainable development and optimization of the use of IPRs as well as promoting their access to market and business opportunities. Similar to some wild animal species, rural people possess hereditary cognitive tendencies towards the medicinal value of wild plant species. It has been documented that wildlife has a tendency to seek out bitter plant parts in response to illness (Van Wyk et al (<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">1997</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Undoubtedly, IPRs play an important role in the social fabric of the Namibia’s economy. While the importance of indigenous plant resources availability for cultural ceremonies such as wedding gifts and other social interactions cannot be assigned a monetary value and therefore could be said to be intangible, it is far from being insignificant. Some researchers have argued that the knowledge base acquired by the indigenous and local people over many hundreds of years was through direct contact with the environment. Such knowledge includes an intimate and detailed knowledge of plants, animals and natural phenomena, the development and use of appropriate technologies for hunting, fishing, trapping, agriculture, forestry and holistic knowledge which parallels the scientific discipline of ecology. It is also argued that a number of harvesters and collectors continue to rely on indigenous plant resources for their livelihoods, either as source of food, income and/or employment opportunities. There is also documented evidence of indigenous technical knowledge on the use of those resources, although many a time it is not widely circulated (Christian <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">1999</CitationRef>; Inglis <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">1993</CitationRef>).</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">In May 2010, the Directorate of Agricultural Research and Training was tasked with the responsibility of designing and carrying out an investigation into the utilization of indigenous plant resources by the local inhabitants throughout Namibia. Subsequently, the directorate designed and distributed a standard questionnaire to 11 of the country’s 13 political regions. The designed questionnaire was used to gauge, determine and document the utilization of different types of indigenous plant resources. During August 2011, the questionnaires were distributed and administered by Extension and Agricultural Research officials as follows: 30 in Caprivi; 10 in Erongo; 20 in Hardap; 40 in Kavango; 20 in Kunene; 20 in Ohangwena; 20 in Omaheke; 30 in Omusati; 20 in Oshana; 20 in Oshikoto; and 20 in Otjozondjupa regions.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The questionnaires were administered by both agricultural research and extension technicians to a total of 250 key informants. For ease of administration, some of the questionnaires were translated into local languages. Upon completion, questionnaires were sent back to MAWF headquarters for coding and analysis. Collected data were coded and analyzed using Excel 2010 version. Additionally, group discussions and field observations were conducted to augment information collected using the questionnaires. Such information has a significant impact not only on resource exploitation by local communities but also on future policy interventions such as plant and tree domestication.

          <Heading>Findings from the Field Survey</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The questionnaire survey covered more than thirty eight (38) indigenous plant resources. This survey documented the practices and usage of indigenous plant resources by different communities in Namibia. The survey revealed that the plant resources were used for medicinal purposes, for food to meet daily sustenance and for income generation. Bearing in mind that indigenous technical knowledge is derived largely from oral traditions passed down generations; the team understands the fact that indeed some useful information may have been lost along the way particularly due to changing practices influenced by the adoption of modern practices and foreign products by the younger generations. The outcome from this case study presents and discusses some of the Namibian indigenous plant resources that have been used traditionally by Namibian rural inhabitants over centuries. Some of these indigenous plant resources are still being used by some members of the communities surveyed. The report documents and discusses the species in the context of their economic importance and usage.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The field survey revealed that nineteen (19) species are used for food and ten (10) for medicinal purposes for both human and livestock while eleven (11) are used as fodder and five (5) as hair food. Out of the 38 plant resources, only six (6) were used for making household utensils, dyes, fiber, clothes and ornaments and/or for the construction of storage utilities. A very significant find among these include the fact that <Emphasis Type="Italic">marula</Emphasis> oil which is traditionally extracted forms a stable lipid currently receiving extensive interest from researchers and development practitioners as well as cosmetic sectors. The study found out that constant use of some of the products from indigenous plant resources has led to the cultivation and eventually domestication of some of the plant species including a variety of palm trees, bird plum trees, wild medlar, jackel berries, <Emphasis Type="Italic">kigelia</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">strychnos</Emphasis> species found scattered in cultivated land tracts.</Para>

A fully-grown plant has a taproot which can grow up to two meters underground with several tubers growing laterally from it. The tubers contain active ingredient with anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects that have been used by the inhabitants of Southern Africa for centuries in treating a wide range of ailments for both human beings as well as animals. The field survey revealed that Devil’s claw is used to treat an array of diseases such malaria, weakness in animals, coughing in both humans and animals, lung sickness, wounds in animals, <Emphasis Type="Italic">anaplasmosis</Emphasis> in livestock, gall-bladder infections and high blood pressure in humans. It is also used for treating other illnesses such as Arthritis, fibrosis and Rheumatism. A mixture of roots and barks treats infertility. Roots alleviate and relieve heavy and painful menstrual periods. The plant is proving to be useful for treating various other ailments.

The fruits are eaten fresh, cooked or used for the production of alcoholic drinks. An entrepreneur has started a business venture, which produces a <Emphasis Type="Italic">maguni</Emphasis> liqueur. The wood can be used for general carpentry. Timber from this tree is also used to produce implement handles, fighting sticks and hut poles. It is also used ornament carving. Local people in these regions derive some livelihood during the fruiting season by gathering and selling the fruits along the road side to passing motorists.</Para>

It also grows well in Mozambique and Zambia. In Namibia, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Marama</Emphasis> bean is reported to have great potential as a cash crop in the communities where it grows. Unfortunately harvesting practice of this legume in the wild is very extensive and random harvesting by local people is threatening some genotypes with extinction in where it grows well. Some wild animals feed on the foliage as well the seeds. The potential of this resource is more pronounced among the KhoiSan, Setswana and Otjiherero speaking populations of Ohangwena region where indigenous technical knowledge system on its utilization exists. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">marama</Emphasis> bean forms part of the diet of the indigenous population. The plant has a large edible tuber and has pods containing oil and protein rich seeds with a nutritional value similar to soybean. In the regions where the survey was carried out, m<Emphasis Type="Italic">arama</Emphasis> beans are roasted and eaten as a snack while young roots are used as vegetable.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Despite the importance of this indigenous plant resource, <Emphasis Type="Italic">marama</Emphasis> bean remains one of Namibia’s “orphaned crops” that is crying out for research that will promote and popularize it’s domestication. Its cultivation has successfully been experimented in Australia, Israel, Kenya, South Africa and the United States especially in the State of Texas. Recently research towards its domestication has been carried out in Namibia (Takundwa et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2012</CitationRef>). Research carried out elsewhere has shown that <Emphasis Type="Italic">marama</Emphasis> beans have protein content of up to 29–39 % and the oil content is 24–48 %. The protein content is comparable to that of soybeans while the oil content is twice that of soybeans; its oil is rich in mono- and/or di-unsaturated fatty acids and contains no cholesterol. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Marama</Emphasis> bean is reputed to be a good source of micronutrients such as calcium, iron, zinc, phosphate, magnesium, and B vitamins including foliate. It is also reported to be a potential source of phytonutrients including phenolic compounds which have been shown in other foods to contribute towards the prevention of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and some cancers. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">marama</Emphasis> bean plant has been shown recently to portray anti-bacterial and anti-retroviral properties and since Retroviruses (RV’s) are a major source of diarrhea in infants, the plant is traditionally used as a treatment against diarrhea (Chingwaru et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>

Fruits have a refreshing sour taste, best eaten when slightly overripe, but can also be used for making jams, jelly and syrups. They can be added to porridge. Oil from the seed is used to soften human skin and for softening animal hides due to its anti-inflammatory and emollient properties when applied to the skin. It is also used for lighting lamps. An extracted concentrate from the leaves is used to soothe inflamed eyes. Infusions of the roots are used as a remedy for dysentery and diarrhea and together with the leaves are taken for abdominal pain and bilharzias. Powdered roots are used to dress wounds; and added to soups and beer as an aphrodisiac. Powdered dried leaves are taken orally for fever and infertility, and extracts of the leaves are used as a gargle for tonsillitis.

          <Heading>Discussion, Conclusions and Recommendations</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">With the world trend of moving towards the use of natural products from indigenous plant resources, there is a wide range of opportunities that small-scale producers in rural areas can take advantages of to improve their diets and to generate additional income. While not all the plant resources documented by this survey are wholly indigenous to Namibia, the rural communities in the country have worked out means and techniques of utilizing these resources beneficially to enrich their livelihoods. The findings from the field survey confirm the many opportunities available to rural communities in Namibia in enhancing food security through putting to use various plant resources in their disposal.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The survey laid bare the fact that indigenous plant resources are used by many communities in the small-scale producers sector to meet their health care needs and/or other religious and cultural practices. The survey revealed that out of 38 plant resources recorded, nineteen (19) species are used for food; ten (10) species are used mainly for medicinal purposes for both humans and livestock, eleven (11) species are used for fodder while five (5) are used as hair food and six (6) are used for construction purposes. This study has created a bench mark towards the documentation of the indigenous technical knowledge existing in Namibia which if well preserved will be available to future generations. The study has also reveled that the full potential of many indigenous plant resources has not yet been fully explored and some of the resources remain as “orphan crops”. Initial findings of research carried out in Namibia and elsewhere indicate that there is very high potential for some plant resources such as <Emphasis Type="Italic">marula</Emphasis> tree, <Emphasis Type="Italic">marama</Emphasis> bean and the devil’s claw.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Namibia is credited for being the first country in Southern African region to establish an indigenous plants dedicated task team. It is worth noting that the research and development initiatives of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry and her development partners in championing the cause of the indigenous plant resources, are beginning to pay dividends. Awareness on the importance of indigenous plant resources created as a result of these initiatives has attracted interest from a variety of stakeholders both locally and from international community. While it is true that significant public and private funds have been invested in the development and promotion of the indigenous plants sector over the years, there has been a positive spillover effect to rural livelihoods countrywide. To ensure sustainability in the management of these valuable resources for the benefit of current and future generations, it is essential that prudent management continue to be accorded top priority by all stakeholders.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Namibia has unique bio-diversity, particularly in the plant kingdom. Some of this diversity is already utilized through traditional use of plants for an array of purposes including food medicine, decoration, clothes and cosmetic industries. Indigenous plant resources continue to play a central role in the livelihoods of small-producers communities living in the rural areas of the country. Efforts to promote commercial use of such plant resources should yield much more success if they are to take full cognizance of indigenous technical knowledge systems. Improvements and strengthening of this knowledge through research, appropriate scientific technologies and continued injection of funds to the sector should lead to the development of business opportunities that would stimulate growth in the localities, increase sales and promote relevant markets for end products. It is encouraging to note that more development agents are now paying attention to indigenous technical knowledge which is recognised as a catalyst for sustainable development.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The past few years have seen an increased amount of effort to upgrade and promote the use of Namibia’s abundant bio-diversity which has culminated into a number of projects supporting the commercial exploitation of indigenous plants. This study has documented and confirmed the wider value of these commodities as contributors to households needs and to the rural economy in general. In the long run, the national and local economies can greatly benefit from indigenous technical knowledge systems through their contribution to tourism through sales of natural products to visitors to the country. It is hoped that the results from this survey will add to the body of knowledge on indigenous plant resources in Namibia but will assist in highlighting the value of the resources to peoples’ livelihoods and sustenance.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The utilization of indigenous plant resources can only be successfully exploited for the benefit of its inhabitants if the existing indigenous technical knowledge is strengthened by scientific research and continuous documentation. More research is required on the full commercial value of some of these resources. Regrettably, many of the indigenous plants are harvested and/or collected from the wild which pose high threat to sustainability that could end in extinction of some species. It is therefore recommended that a domestication program be formulated and implemented for targeted species that have high economic, medicinal and cultural significance such as the <Emphasis Type="Italic">marama</Emphasis> bean, Devil’s Claw, and the <Emphasis Type="Italic">marula</Emphasis> trees. The harvesting of all indigenous plant resources with economic and traditional significance such as <Emphasis Type="Italic">ximenia, strychnos</Emphasis>, palm trees, bird plum trees and <Emphasis Type="Italic">manketti</Emphasis> nut trees should be strictly controlled and their conservation enforced to curb over-harvesting and eventual extinction.</Para>
