It is known that some organisms are capable of synthesising organic molecules from inorganic precursors and of storing biochemical energy in the process. These are called autotrophs, meaning ‘self-feeding’. Autotrophs also are referred to as primary producers. Organisms able to manufacture complex organic molecules from simple inorganic compounds (water, CO<Subscript>2</Subscript>, nutrients) include plants, some protists and some bacteria. The process by which they do this usually is photosynthesis, and as its name implies, photosynthesis requires light. There are two general approaches by which primary production can be measured: one can measure either (a) the rate of photosynthesis or (b) the rate of increase in plant biomass. Without autotrophs, there would be no energy available to all other organisms that lack the capability of fixing light energy. However, the continual loss of energy due to metabolic activity puts limits on how much energy is available to higher trophic levels. All of the animal species on Earth are consumers, and they depend upon producer organisms for their food. For all practical purposes, it is the products of terrestrial plant productivity that sustain humans. A pyramid of biomass is a representation of the amount of energy contained in biomass, at different trophic levels for a given point in time. Pyramid of numbers represents the number of organisms in each trophic level.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Primary production is the production of organic compounds from atmospheric or aquatic carbon dioxide, mainly through the process of photosynthesis. Nearly all life on Earth is directly or indirectly reliant on primary production. The organisms which are responsible for primary production are known as primary producers or autotrophs and form the base of the food chain. In terrestrial ecoregions, these are mainly plants, while in aquatic ecoregions, algae are primarily responsible. Primary production is the production of chemical energy in organic compounds by living organisms. The main source of this energy is sunlight, but a minute fraction of primary production is driven by lithotrophic organisms using the chemical energy of inorganic molecules. The energy is used to synthesise complex organic molecules from simpler inorganic compounds regardless of source such as carbon dioxide (CO<Subscript>2</Subscript>) and water (H<Subscript>2</Subscript>O). The following two equations are simplified representations of photosynthesis and chemosynthesis:<Equation ID="Equa">

These relatively simple molecules may be then used to further synthesise more complicated molecules, including proteins, complex carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, or be respired to perform work. Consumption of primary producers by heterotrophic organisms, such as animals, then transfers these organic molecules (and the energy stored within them) up the food web, fuelling all of the Earth’s living systems.</Para>

          <Heading>Terrestrial Production</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">On the land, almost all primary production is now performed by vascular plants, with a small fraction coming from algae and nonvascular plants such as mosses and liverworts. Before the evolution of vascular plants, nonvascular plants likely play a more significant role. Primary production on land is a function of many factors but principally local hydrology and temperature. While plants cover much of the Earth’s surface, they are strongly curtailed wherever temperatures are too extreme or where necessary plant resources (principally water and light) are limiting, such as deserts or polar regions.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Water is ‘consumed’ in plants by the processes of photosynthesis and transpiration. The latter process is driven by the evaporation of water from the leaves of plants. Transpiration allows plants to transport water and mineral nutrients from the soil to growth regions and also cools the plant. Diffusion of water out of a leaf is the force that drives transpiration and is regulated by structures known as stomata. These also regulate the diffusion of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the leaf, such that decreasing water loss also decreases carbon dioxide gain. Certain plants use alternative forms of photosynthesis, called crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) and C4. These employ physiological and anatomical adaptations to increase water-use efficiency and allow increased primary production to take place under conditions that would normally limit carbon fixation by C3 plants.</Para>
        </Section1>
        <Section1 ID="Sec4">
          <Heading>Oceanic Production</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In a reversal of the pattern on land, in the oceans, almost all primary production is performed by algae, with a small fraction contributed by vascular plants and other groups. Algae encompass a diverse range of organisms, ranging from single floating cells to attached seaweeds. They include photoautotrophs from a variety of groups. Eubacteria are important photosynthesizers in both oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems, and while some archaea are phototrophic, none are known to utilise oxygen-evolving photosynthesis (Schäfer et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">1999</CitationRef>). A number of eukaryotes are significant contributors to primary production in the ocean, including green algae, brown algae and red algae, and a diverse group of unicellular groups. Vascular plants are also represented in the ocean by groups such as the seagrasses. Unlike terrestrial ecosystems, the majority of primary production in the ocean is performed by free-living microscopic organisms called phytoplankton. Larger autotrophs, such as the seagrasses and macroalgae (seaweeds), are generally confined to the littoral zone and adjacent shallow waters, where they can attach to the underlying substrate but still be within the photic zone. There are exceptions, such as <Emphasis Type="Italic">Sargassum</Emphasis>, but the vast majority of free-floating production takes place within microscopic organisms.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The factors limiting primary production in the ocean are also very different from those on land. The availability of water, obviously, is not an issue. Similarly, temperature, while affecting metabolic rates, ranges less widely in the ocean than on land because the heat capacity of seawater buffers temperature changes and the formation of sea ice insulates it at lower temperatures. However, the availability of light, the source of energy for photosynthesis, and mineral nutrients, the building blocks for new growth, plays crucial roles in regulating primary production in the ocean.</Para>
          <Section2 ID="Sec5">
            <Heading>Light</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The sunlit zone of the ocean is called the photic zone (or euphotic zone). This is a relatively thin layer (10–100 m) near the ocean’s surface where there is sufficient light for photosynthesis to occur. For practical purposes, the thickness of the photic zone is typically defined by the depth at which light reaches 1% of its surface value. Light is attenuated down the water column by its absorption or scattering by the water itself and by dissolved or particulate material within it (including phytoplankton).</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Net photosynthesis in the water column is determined by the interaction between the photic zone and the mixed layer. Turbulent mixing by wind energy at the ocean’s surface homogenises the water column vertically until the turbulence dissipates. The deeper the mixed layer, the lower the average amount of light intercepted by phytoplankton within it. The mixed layer can vary from being shallower than the photic zone to being much deeper than the photic zone. When it is much deeper than the photic zone, this results in phytoplankton spending too much time in the dark for net growth to occur. The maximum depth of the mixed layer in which net growth can occur is called the critical depth. As long as there are adequate nutrients available, net primary production occurs whenever the mixed layer is shallower than the critical depth. Both the magnitude of wind mixing and the availability of light at the ocean’s surface are affected across a range of space- and timescales. The most characteristic of these is the seasonal cycle, although wind magnitudes additionally have strong spatial components. Consequently, primary production in temperate regions such as the North Atlantic is highly seasonal, varying with both incident light at the water’s surface (reduced in winter) and the degree of mixing (increased in winter). In tropical regions, such as the gyres in the middle of the major basins, light may only vary slightly across the year, and mixing may only occur episodically, such as during large storms or hurricanes.</Para>
            <Section3 ID="Sec6">
              <Heading>Nutrients</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Mixing also plays an important role in the limitation of primary production by nutrients. Inorganic nutrients, such as nitrate, phosphate and silicic acid, are necessary for phytoplankton to synthesise their cells and cellular machinery. Because of gravitational sinking of particulate material (such as plankton, dead or faecal material), nutrients are constantly lost from the photic zone and are only replenished by mixing or upwelling of deeper water. This is exacerbated where summertime solar heating and reduced winds increase vertical stratification and lead to a strong thermocline, since this makes it more difficult for wind mixing to entrain deeper water. Consequently, between mixing events, primary production (and the resulting processes that lead to sinking particulate material) constantly acts to consume nutrients in the mixed layer, and in many regions, this leads to nutrient exhaustion and decreased mixed layer production in the summer (even in the presence of abundant light). However, as long as the photic zone is deep enough, primary production may continue below the mixed layer where light-limited growth rates mean that nutrients are often more abundant.</Para>
              <Section4 ID="Sec7">
                <Heading>Iron</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Another factor relatively recently discovered to play a significant role in oceanic primary production is the micronutrient iron (Martin and Fitzwater <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">1988</CitationRef>). This is used as a cofactor in enzymes involved in processes such as nitrate reduction and nitrogen fixation. A major source of iron to the oceans is dust from the Earth’s deserts, picked up and delivered by the wind as Aeolian dust. In regions of the ocean that are distant from deserts or that are not reached by dust-carrying winds, the lack of iron can severely limit the amount of primary production that can occur. These areas are sometimes known as HNLC (high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll) regions because the scarcity of iron both limits phytoplankton growth and leaves a surplus of other nutrients. It is suggested introducing iron to these areas as a means of increasing primary productivity and sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (Cooper et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">1996</CitationRef>).</Para>

          <Heading>Measurement</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The methods for measurement of primary production vary depending on whether gross versus net production is the desired measure and whether terrestrial or aquatic systems are the focus. Gross production is almost always harder to measure than net because of respiration, which is a continuous and ongoing process that consumes some of the products of primary production before they can be accurately measured. Also, terrestrial ecosystems are generally more difficult because a substantial proportion of total productivity is shunted to below ground organs and tissues, where it is logistically difficult to measure. Shallow water aquatic systems can also face this problem.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Scale also greatly affects measurement techniques. The rate of carbon assimilation in plant tissues, organs, whole plants or plankton samples can be quantified by biochemically based techniques, but these techniques are decidedly inappropriate for large-scale terrestrial field situations. There, net primary production is almost always the desired variable, and estimation techniques involve various methods of estimating dry-weight biomass changes over time. Biomass estimates are often converted to an energy measure, such as kilocalories, by an empirically determined conversion factor.</Para>
        </Section1>
        <Section1 ID="Sec9">
          <Heading>Terrestrial</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In terrestrial ecosystems, researchers generally measure net primary production. Although its definition is straightforward, field measurements used to estimate productivity vary according to investigator and biome. Field estimates rarely account for below ground productivity, herbivore, decomposition, turnover, litterfall, volatile organic compounds, root exudates and allocation to symbiotic microorganisms. Biomass-based NPP estimates result in underestimation of NPP due to incomplete accounting of these components (Clark et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2001</CitationRef>; Scurlock et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2002</CitationRef>). However, many field measurements correlate well to NPP. There are a number of comprehensive reviews of the field methods used to estimate NPP (Clark et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2001</CitationRef>; Scurlock et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2002</CitationRef>; Leith and Whittaker <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">1975</CitationRef>). Estimates of ecosystem respiration, the total carbon dioxide produced by the ecosystem, can also be made with gas flux measurements.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The major unaccounted pool is below ground productivity, especially production and turnover of roots. Below ground components of NPP are difficult to measure. BNPP is often estimated based on a ratio of ANPP:BNPP rather than direct measurements.</Para>
        </Section1>
        <Section1 ID="Sec10">
          <Heading>Grasslands</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Most frequently, peak standing biomass is assumed to measure NPP. In systems with persistent standing litter, live biomass is commonly reported. Measures of peak biomass are more reliable in if the system is predominantly annuals. However, perennial measurements can be reliable if there was a synchronous phenology driven by a strong seasonal climate. These methods may underestimate ANPP in grasslands by as much as twofold (temperate) to fourfold (tropical) (Scurlock et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2002</CitationRef>). Repeated measures of standing live and dead biomass provide more accurate estimates of all grasslands, particularly those with large turnover, rapid decomposition and interspecific variation in timing of peak biomass. Wetland productivity (marshes and fens) is similarly measured. In Europe, annual mowing makes the annual biomass increment of wetlands evident.</Para>

        <Section1 ID="Sec11">
          <Heading>Forests</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Methods used to measure forest productivity are more diverse than those of grasslands. Biomass increment based on stand-specific allometry plus litterfall is considered a suitable although incomplete accounting of above-ground net primary production (ANPP). Field measurements used as a proxy for ANPP include annual litterfall, diameter or basal area increment (DBH or BAI) and volume increment.</Para>

        <Section1 ID="Sec12">
          <Heading>Aquatic</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In aquatic systems, primary production is typically measured using one of five main techniques (Marra <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2002</CitationRef>): (i) By variations in oxygen concentration within a sealed bottle.

          <Para TextBreak="No">The technique developed by Gaarder and Gran uses variations in the concentration of oxygen under different experimental conditions to infer gross primary production. Typically, three identical transparent vessels are filled with sample water and stoppered. The first is analysed immediately and used to determine the initial oxygen concentration; usually, this is done by performing a Winkler titration. The other two vessels are incubated, one under light and the other darkened. After a fixed period of time, the experiment ends, and the oxygen concentration in both vessels is measured. As photosynthesis has not taken place in the dark vessel, it provides a measure of ecosystem respiration. The light vessel permits both photosynthesis and respiration and so provides a measure of net photosynthesis (i.e. oxygen production via photosynthesis subtract oxygen consumption by respiration). Gross primary production is then obtained by adding oxygen consumption in the dark vessel to net oxygen production in the light vessel.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The technique of using <Superscript>14</Superscript>C incorporation (added as labelled Na<Subscript>2</Subscript>CO<Subscript>3</Subscript>) to infer primary production is most commonly used today because it is sensitive and can be used in all ocean environments. As <Superscript>14</Superscript>C is radioactive (via beta decay), it is relatively straightforward to measure its incorporation in organic material using devices such as scintillation counters.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Depending upon the incubation time chosen, net or gross primary production can be estimated. Gross primary production is best estimated using relatively short incubation times (1 h or less), since the loss of incorporated <Superscript>14</Superscript>C (by respiration and organic material excretion/exudation) will be more limited. Net primary production is the fraction of gross production remaining after these loss processes have consumed some of the fixed carbon.</Para>

This is particularly true in experiments making use of natural assemblages of microscopic autotrophs, where it is not possible to isolate them from their consumers.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Using satellite-derived estimates of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for terrestrial habitats and sea-surface chlorophyll for the oceans, it is estimated that the total (photoautotrophic) primary production for the Earth was 104.9 Gt C year<Superscript>−1</Superscript>.

In addition to this, end consumption by people raises the total human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) (Vitousek et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">1986</CitationRef>) to 23.8% of potential vegetation (NPP<Subscript>0</Subscript>) (Haberl et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2007</CitationRef>).

This disproportionate amount reduces the energy available to other species, having a marked impact on biodiversity, flows of carbon, water and energy and ecosystem services, and scientists have questioned how large this fraction can be before these services begin to break down (Foley et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">It is known that some organisms are capable of synthesising organic molecules from inorganic precursors and of storing biochemical energy in the process. These are called autotrophs, meaning ‘self-feeding’. Autotrophs also are referred to as primary producers. Organisms able to manufacture complex organic molecules from simple inorganic compounds (water, CO<Subscript>2</Subscript>, nutrients) include plants, some protists and some bacteria. The process by which they do this usually is photosynthesis, and as its name implies, photosynthesis requires light. Some producer organisms, mostly specialised bacteria, can convert inorganic nutrients to organic compounds without the presence of sunlight. There are several groups of chemosynthetic bacteria in marine and freshwater environments, particularly those rich in sulphur or hydrogen sulphide gas. Like chlorophyll-bearing plants and other organisms capable of photosynthesis, chemosynthetic organisms are autotrophs. Many organisms can only obtain their energy by feeding on other organisms. These are called heterotrophs. They include consumers of any organism, in any form: plants, animals, microbes and even dead tissue. Heterotrophs also are called consumers.</Para>

When a crop of wheat grows, new organic matter is created by the process of photosynthesis, which converts light energy into energy stored in chemical bonds within plant tissue. This energy fuels the metabolic machinery of the plant. New compounds and structures are synthesised, cells divide and the plant grows in size over time.</Para>

The core idea is that new chemical compounds and new plant tissue are produced. Over time, primary production results in the addition of new plant biomass to the system. Consumers derive their energy from primary producers, either directly (herbivores, some detritivores) or indirectly (predators, other detritivores).</Para>

            <Heading>Energy Production by Primary Producers</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The intensity of solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface depends partly on location: The maximum energy intensity is received at the equator, and the intensity decreases as one moves towards the poles. The ecosystems have profound effects on climate, and this leads to the observed geographic patterns of biomes. Furthermore, only a small fraction of the Sun’s radiation is actually used in the photosynthetic reaction in plants at the Earth’s surface. Of the total solar radiation striking the Earth’s outer atmosphere, about half of it is reflected back to space by ice, snow, oceans or deserts or absorbed by gases in the atmosphere—for example, the atmosphere’s ozone gas layer absorbs nearly all ultraviolet light, which makes up about 9% of the Sun’s radiation.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">About half of the light that reaches Earth’s surface is in the wavelength range that can be used by plants in photosynthesis (~400–700 nm wavelength)—this is called the photosynthetically active radiation, or PAR. Plants strongly absorb light of blue and red wavelengths; hence, they appear green in colour, the result of reflection of green wavelengths, as well as light in the far-infrared region, and they reflect light in the near-infrared region. Even if the wavelength is correct, the light energy is not at all converted into carbon by photosynthesis. Some of the light misses the leaf chloroplast, where the photosynthetic reactions occur, and much of the energy from light that is converted by photosynthesis to carbon compounds is used up in keeping the plant biochemical ‘machinery’ operating properly—this loss is generally termed ‘respiration’, although it also includes thermodynamic losses. Plants do not use all of the light energy theoretically available to them. On an average, plant gross primary production on Earth is about 5.83 × 10<Superscript>6</Superscript> cal m<Superscript>−2</Superscript> year<Superscript>−1</Superscript>. This is about 0.06% of the amount of solar energy falling per square metre on the outer edge of the Earth’s atmosphere per year (defined as the solar constant and equal to 1.05 × 10<Superscript>10</Superscript> cal m<Superscript>−2</Superscript> year<Superscript>−1</Superscript>). After the costs of respiration, plant net primary production is reduced to 4.95 × 10<Superscript>6</Superscript> cal m<Superscript>−2</Superscript> year<Superscript>−1</Superscript> or about 0.05% of the solar constant. This is the ‘average’ efficiency, and in land plants, this value can reach ~2–3%, and in aquatic systems, this value can reach ~1%. This relatively low efficiency of conversion of solar energy into energy in carbon compounds sets the overall amount of energy available to heterotrophs at all other trophic levels.</Para>

          <Heading>Patterns and Controls of Primary Production in the World’s Ecosystems</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In terms of NPP per unit area, the most productive systems are estuaries, swamps and marshes, tropical rain forests and temperate rain forests. If one wants to know the total amount of NPP in the world, one must multiply these values by the area that the various ecosystems occupied. In doing that, we find that now the most productive systems are open oceans, tropical rain forests, savannas and tropical seasonal forests. Basically, the answer is that climate and nutrients control primary productivity. Overall, the amount of water available limits land primary production on our world, in part due to the large areas of desert found on certain continents. Agricultural crops are especially productive due to ‘artificial’ subsidies of water and fertilisers, as well as the control of pests.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Even though temperature and especially precipitation are related to production, one notices a large degree of ‘scatter’ around the line of best fit. This scatter or variation is due in part to other aspects of particular (local) systems, such as their nutrient availability or their turnover rates. For example, grasslands can have a relatively high rate of primary production occurring during a brief growing season, yet the standing crop biomass is never very great. This is indicative of a high turnover rate. In a forest, on the other hand, the standing crop biomass of above-ground wood and below ground roots is large. Each year’s production of new plant matter is a small fraction of total standing crop, and so the turnover of forest biomass is much lower.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Another good example is seen in the oceans, where most of the primary production is concentrated in microscopic algae. Algae have short life cycles, multiply rapidly, do not generate much biomass relative to their numbers and are eaten rapidly by herbivores. At any given point in time, then, the standing crop of algae in an ocean is likely low, but the turnover rate can be high.</Para>

When we talk of moving ‘up’ the food chain, we are speaking figuratively and mean that we move from plants to herbivores to carnivores.

          <Para TextBreak="No">In the process, metabolic work is done and energy in chemical bonds is converted to heat energy. If NPP was not consumed, it would pile up somewhere. Usually this does not happen, but during periods of Earth history such as the Carboniferous and Pennsylvanian, enormous amounts of NPP in excess of consumption accumulated in swamps. It was buried and compressed to form the coal and oil deposits that we mine today. When we burn these deposits (same chemical reaction as above except that there is greater energy produced), we release the energy to drive the machines of industry, and of course, the CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> goes into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas. This is the situation that we have today, where the excess CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> from burning these deposits (past excess NPP) is going into the atmosphere and building up over time. An ecosystem is in ‘steady state’ (‘equilibrium’) where annual total respiration balances annual total GPP. As energy passes from trophic level to trophic level, the following rules apply: Firstly, only a fraction of the energy available at one trophic level is transferred to the next trophic level. The rule of thumb is 10%, but this is very approximate. Secondly, typically, the numbers and biomass of organisms decrease as one ascends the food chain.</Para>

Part of this material is processed by the digestive system and used to make new cells or tissues, and this part is called assimilation. What cannot be assimilated, for example, maybe some parts of the plant stems or roots, exits the hare’s body, and this is called excretion. Thus, we can make the following definition: assimilation = (ingestion − excretion). The efficiency of this process of assimilation varies in animals, ranging from 15 to 50% if the food is plant material and from 60 to 90% if the food is animal material.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The hare uses a significant fraction of the assimilated energy just being a hare—maintaining a high, constant body temperature, synthesising proteins and hopping about. This energy used (lost) is attributed to cellular respiration. The remainder goes into making more hare biomass by growth and reproduction (i.e. increasing the overall biomass of hares by creating offspring). The conversion of assimilated energy into new tissue is termed secondary production in consumers, and it is conceptually the same as the primary production or NPP of plants. In our example, the secondary production of the hare is the energy available to foxes who eat the hares for their needs. Clearly, because all the energy costs of hares engaged in normal metabolic activities, the energy available to foxes is much less than the energy available to hares.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Just as we calculate the assimilation efficiency in the same way, we can also calculate the net production efficiency for any organism. This efficiency is equal to the production divided by the assimilation for animals or the NPP divided by the GPP for plants. The ‘production’ refers to growth plus reproduction. In equation form, the net production efficiency = (production/assimilation) or for plants = (NPP/GPP). These ratios measure the efficiency with which an organism converts assimilated energy into primary or secondary production.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">These efficiencies vary among organisms, largely due to widely differing metabolic requirements. For instance, an average, vertebrates uses about 98% of assimilated energy for metabolism, leaving only 2% for growth and reproduction. On an average, invertebrates use only ~80% of assimilated energy for metabolism and thus exhibit greater net production efficiency (~20%) than do vertebrates. Plants have the greatest net production efficiencies, which range from 30 to 85%. The reason that some organisms have such low net production efficiencies is that they are homeotherms, or animals that maintain a constant internal body temperature. This requires much more energy than is used by poikilotherms, which are organisms that do not regulate their temperatures internally.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Just as one can build our understanding of a system from the individual to the population to the community, in the same way, one can examine whole trophic levels by calculating ecological efficiencies. Ecological efficiency is defined as the energy supply available to trophic level N + 1, divided by the energy consumed by trophic level N. It can be considered as the efficiency of hares at converting plants into fox food. For example, the ecological efficiency = fox production/hare production. The ecological efficiency is a ‘combined’ measure that takes into account both the assimilation and net production efficiencies. This can be combined to different species of plants and animals into a single trophic level and then the ecological efficiency can be examined, for example, all of the plants in a field being fed on all of the different grazers from insects to cows.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Thinking about the overall ecological efficiency in a system brings us back to our first rule for the transfer of energy through trophic levels and up the food chain. In general, only about 10% of the energy consumed by one level is available to the next. For example, if hares consumed 1,000 kcal of plant energy, they might only be able to form 100 kcal of new hare tissue. For the hare population to be in steady state (neither increasing nor decreasing), each year’s consumption of hares by foxes should roughly equal each year’s production of new hare biomass. So the foxes consume about 100 kcal of hare biomass and convert perhaps 10 kcal into new fox biomass. In fact, this ecological efficiency is quite variable, with homeotherms averaging 1–5% and poikilotherms averaging 5–15%. The overall loss of energy from lower to higher trophic levels is important in setting the absolute number of trophic levels that any ecosystem can contain.</Para>

          <Heading>Pyramids of Biomass, Energy and Numbers</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">A pyramid of biomass is a representation of the amount of energy contained in biomass, at different trophic levels for a given point in time. The amount of energy available to one trophic level is limited by the amount stored by the level below. Because energy is lost in the transfer from one level to the next, there is successively less total energy as one moves up trophic levels. In general, one expects that higher trophic levels would have less total biomass than those below because less energy is available to them.</Para>
          <Section2 ID="Sec24">
            <Heading>Pyramid of Numbers</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Pyramid of numbers could also be constructed, which as its name implies represents the number of organisms in each trophic level. For the oceans, the bottom level would be quite large, due to the enormous number of small algae. For other ecosystems, the pyramid of numbers might be inverted, for instance, if a forest’s plant community was composed of only a handful of very large trees, and yet there were many millions of insect grazers which are the plant material.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Just as with the inverted pyramid of numbers, in some rare exceptions, there could be an inverted pyramid of biomass, where the biomass of the lower trophic level is less than the biomass of the next higher trophic level. The oceans are such an exception because at any point in time, the total amount of biomass in microscopic algae is small. Thus, a pyramid of biomass for the oceans can appear inverted. If the amount of energy in biomass at one level sets the limit of energy in biomass at the next level, as was the case with the hares and foxes, then how can one have less energy at the lower trophic level? Even though the biomass may be small, the rate at which new biomass is produced may be very large. Thus, over time, it is the amount of new biomass that is produced, from whatever the standing stock of biomass might be, that is important for the next trophic level.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">This further can be examined by constructing a pyramid of energy, which shows rates of production rather than standing crop. Algal populations can double in a few days, whereas the zooplankton that feed on them reproduce more slowly and might double in numbers in a few months, and the fish feeding on zooplankton might only reproduce once a year. Thus, a pyramid of energy takes into account the turnover rate of the organisms and can never be inverted. Thinking about pyramids of energy and turnover time is similar to the residence time of elements. But here, one is talking about the residence time of ‘energy’. The residence time of energy is equal to the energy in biomass divided by the net productivity, <Emphasis Type="Italic">R</Emphasis>
              <Subscript>t</Subscript> = (energy in biomass/net productivity). The residence time of energy in the primary producers of various ecosystems is calculated; then we find that the residence times range from about 20 to 25 years for forests (both tropical rainforests and boreal forests), down to ~3–5 years for grasslands and finally down to only 10–15 days for lakes and oceans. This difference in residence time between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems is reflected in the pyramids of biomass. It is also very important to consider in analysing how these different ecosystems would respond to a disturbance or what scheme might best be used to manage the resources of the ecosystem.</Para>
