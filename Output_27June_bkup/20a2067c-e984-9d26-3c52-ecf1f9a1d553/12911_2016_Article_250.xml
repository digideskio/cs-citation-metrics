                <Para ID="Par3">Trust in a rehabilitation portal is the sum of trust in different factors. These factors and what makes up these factors differ for patients and healthcare professionals. For example, trust in technology is made up, for patients, mostly by a perceived level of control and privacy, while for healthcare professionals, a larger and different set of issues play a role, including technical reliability and a transparent data storage policy. Healthcare professionals distrust activity sensor data for informing patient treatment, as they think that sensors are unable to record the whole range of movements that patients make (e.g., walking and ironing clothes).</Para>

              <Heading>Background</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par5">Trust has been studied widely within the context of technology acceptance and use, and is generally seen as an important antecedent of the acceptance and use of, and loyalty towards eServices (services provided via the Internet) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. This is also the case for telemedicine, where trust has been found to be an important antecedent of patient acceptance [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>], patients’ and healthy persons’ thoughts on the usefulness of a personal health record [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>], and physicians’ intention to use a telemedicine service [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. Telemedicine refers to health services that enable patients to receive treatment in their daily living environment, whereby distance is bridged by ICT, and at least one healthcare professional is involved [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. Models that explain trust have been developed for online services within contexts like eCommerce [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>] or eGovernment [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>], but are lacking for telemedicine. And telemedicine is a different kind of service: End-users (patients) do not purchase a good or service, but use a technology as part of treatment, while the party offering the service is a medical organization that bought the technology from a developer and offers it free of charge (depending on the nature of the technology and the applicable healthcare insurance or government regulations) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par6">Trust in online services has been defined in many different ways. Some authors see trust as one-dimensional. For example, Corritore and colleagues defined this type of trust as “an attitude of confident expectation in an online situation of risk that one’s vulnerabilities will not be exploited” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. Other authors have posited that trust is two-dimensional (whereby trust in the organization providing the technology and trust in the technology itself make up trust in an online service [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]), or even multi-dimensional. The most well-known models for trust in online services have applied a multidimensional approach. Mcknight et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>] have developed a very elaborate model of trust in web vendors whereby trust is affected by an individual’s disposition to trust, experience with the Internet as a trustworthy medium, perceived website quality, and trust in the organization behind the website; Gefen et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>] came to a model of trust in online shopping in which trust is affected by trust in the organization providing the service, situation normality (i.e., a situation in which a person’s expectations of how a certain service should go about are confirmed) and structural assurances (e.g., guarantees, seals of approval). Within the context of this article, we see trust as a reliance on a health organization by its end-users and stakeholders with regard to the service it provides (and the factors that make up this service) in both an online and offline setting. By defining trust this way, we focus the current work on the formation of trusting beliefs: perceptions of specific attributes of the provider of the eService [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. Positive trusting beliefs are a prerequisite for positive trusting intentions. Positive trusting intentions, on their turn, are a prerequisite for trust-related behavior (such as using a service). This line of thought assumes that people go through several trust-related steps before actual use of a service and that each of these steps must have a positive outcome before the final, desired behavior takes place. Such reasoning can also be found in similar behavioral models such as the theory of planned behavior [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>] and the technology acceptance model [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par7">A lot of research has focused on identifying what makes up consumer trust in online health information when searching the Internet for general information about a condition or for informing oneself before making a medical decision [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. In these cases, factors like source credibility and the currency of information (i.e., how up-to-date information is) play an important role. Telemedicine is part of patient treatment and it can be expected that trust works differently here, as it is likely to be influenced by relationships with a healthcare professional or a healthcare organization. However, the research on trust in telemedicine services is still in a stage of infancy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>], and only a few studies have made a first attempt at identifying factors that affect trust in telemedicine services. Physicians’ trust in electronic health care records was found to be influenced by perceived risk and information integrity [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>] and healthcare professionals’ trust in an adverse event reporting system was found to be influenced by the subjective norm [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. Brown and colleagues [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>], finally, stated that the disposition to trust any telemedicine service by healthcare professionals is dependent on personality traits (e.g., one’s need for control or competitiveness). The aforementioned studies show that trust in telemedicine services will probably be multidimensional. However, the factors that have been identified so far to explain trust in telemedicine services do not disclose a coherent picture and are only approached from the healthcare professionals’ perspective.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par8">In this study, we took an empirical, exploratory approach to map a specific instance of trust, namely trust in a telemedicine service. As such, the current study draws from the broader literature on trust in medical services [e.g., <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>] and contributes to the body of knowledge on trust and eService design for the healthcare domain. More specifically, we mapped the concept of trust in relation to a rehabilitation portal and determined what makes end-users (dis)trust this rehabilitation portal. As we focus on trusting beliefs, our aim was to identify the factors or issues that affect people’s perception of this rehabilitation portal’s trustworthiness. Whenever we talk of ‘trust’ in the remainder of the article, we are talking about trusting beliefs, not the actual act of trusting someone or something (trusting behavior). The portal under investigation is used within the treatment of individual patients (e.g., Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, chronic pain), includes many features (provision of disease-related information, an electronic patient file, remote exercising, and the use of sensor technology), and therefore makes an interesting case study for assessing trust in state-of-the-art rehabilitation portals. The results of this study can serve as a first basis for developing a fine-grained understanding of what makes up trust in telemedicine portals for rehabilitation care (both from a patient’s and a healthcare professional’s view). Such information is crucial for designing these services and implementation strategies that take end-users’ concerns about trust into account and thus, have a higher chance of success.</Para>

                <Para ID="Par10">All participants were recruited via two large rehabilitation centers in the Netherlands to which the researchers had access: One in the metropolitan region of Amsterdam, and one in the rural region of Enschede. This resulted in two focus groups with patients and two focus groups with healthcare professionals. We split these two groups to allow the patients to speak freely about their treatment and care providers (otherwise it was possible that patients would end up with members of their care team in the same focus group). Healthcare professionals were recruited by the researchers, while patients were recruited by the researchers (in Enschede) or by healthcare professionals (in Amsterdam). We aimed for a group size of 4 to 8 participants, whereby we recruited more people to account for persons who declined at a late moment [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para ID="Par11">During the focus groups, we made use of screenshots of a portal of a large, Dutch rehabilitation center. This portal is provided to patients as soon as they start their treatment in the rehabilitation center and allows them to manage appointments, complete questionnaires, or exercise at home by using a personal schedule and online instruction videos. This allows patients to exercise at home, without the aid of professionals. Professionals can use the portal to monitor patients and for providing personalized rehabilitation programs. Next, the use of activity sensors for informing treatment was demonstrated by explaining how activity data can be recorded by means of a hip-worn sensor and how this data can be displayed to the patient and the healthcare professional. The professional can then make use of this data during a consultation for advising patients on how to distribute their energy over the day in a well-balanced manner. For more information on the development and workings of the rehabilitation portal, see [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>]. We selected this portal as a discussion starter, as it entails different functionalities that utilize different kinds of (personal) data, including activity monitoring (which can be considered to be a ‘quantified self’ application). Therefore, we expected it to evoke a lot of discussion about end-users’ thoughts on the value of technology (as part of treatment), and the storage and use of personal data.</Para>

                <Para ID="Par12">Each focus group started with an introduction of its goal. Then, the participants provided informed consent and gave permission for audio recording. The participants were assured that they would remain anonymous and that their decision to participate would not affect their treatment or their professional position in any way. Due to the nature of the study (an exploratory study with adult volunteers that aimed to inform information systems design), approval from an ethics committee was not necessary [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>]. The study was officially exempt from medical ethical assessment by the Medical Ethical Committee of Twente. We anticipated that it would be difficult for participants to verbalize their thoughts about a concept as abstract as trust. To help them, we used visual materials to support all parts of the session, such as large sheets of paper on which the participants could draw and write down their thoughts.</Para>

They did so in pairs to stimulate discussion among each other. Participants could stick cue cards to a large sheet of paper on which the four subjects were displayed. These cue cards included the following terms: Reputation, competence, conservation, accuracy, responsibility, secrecy, transparency, controllability, authenticity, openness, reliability, and safety. However, participants were also allowed to add self-devised terms. See Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef> for an example.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

Then they were asked what they thought about these cues. Do they in- or decrease trust? And why? The professionals were shown screenshots of the professionals’ side of the portal and were asked to comment on the interface and interaction design of 1) the homepage, 2) the patient overview, and 3) a screen depicting the current status of a patient. We opted for visual design as the primary subject of discussion as the login procedure and disclaimer do not play a prominent role in this part of the portal, and because visual design and navigation design play a crucial role in forming trust [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>].</Para>

The latter was done by letting the participants place cue cards with different stakeholders (e.g., general practitioners, insurance companies) on a sheet of paper that depicted a continuum (ranging from ‘not allowed’ to ‘allowed’). Finally, they were asked to state a preference for a large-size activity sensor (the ProMove2, 65 × 50 × 30 mm, 70 g; to be worn with a belt-clip) and data storage by a care organization, or a small activity sensor and data storage by a commercial organization (the Fitbit one, 48 × 19 × 10 mm, 8 g; can be worn in a pocket or clipped to a belt or bra).

Two analysts (LvV and IF) grouped similar responses (separately for patients and healthcare professionals) to identify which factors were named most often when stating what makes up trust in a healthcare professional, rehabilitation center, treatment, or portal technology. Any disputes were resolved by discussion. Next, the audio recordings were analyzed on a per-question basis, using inductive thematic analysis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>].

Patient participants were fine with rehabilitation centers, their general practitioner, hospitals and researchers storing their data. Those that were allowed to view the data were mostly medical specialists, physical therapists, their general practitioner, and researchers. The group of stakeholders that was not allowed to store data was similar to the group that was not allowed to view data.

Trust in the rehabilitation center was mostly the result of its reputation. Trust in rehabilitation portal technology, finally, was mainly determined by its reliability and the degree to which privacy is possible.

                <Para ID="Par75">Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef> shows that patients and healthcare professionals more or less agree on the factors that make up trust in the rehabilitation center that provides the portal, and the factors that make up trust in a treatment. Trust in the healthcare professional and patients are, of course, unique for each end-user group. Trust in the technology, finally, means something different for patients than for healthcare professionals, suggesting that their needs and wishes on this topic need to be addressed separately during the design of trustworthy portal technology for rehabilitation care. Several of the factors we found in this study were also identified in previous research. The competence and openness of the healthcare professional were also identified by others as important for creating trust in a physician [<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>], while usability has also been identified as a pivotal part of trust in eServices before [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>]. We also found an indication of prior experience with telemedicine playing a role in the formation of trust beliefs among healthcare professionals, where bad experiences led to low trust. This hypothesis should be investigated further in future research.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par76">The factors that, we found, affect trust in a telemedicine portal for rehabilitation care appeared to both overlap and differ, when compared to the factors that make up leading models that explain trust in eServices. The model by McKnight et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>], for example, also includes factors like perceived site quality and institution-based trust. The make-up of these factors, however, appears to be different for a medical context. The model for developing initial trust in an online company by Koufaris and Hampton-Sosa [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>] identifies organization reputation, perceived ease of use, and perceived security control as important antecedents, but does not include healthcare-specific factors. We have identified several antecedents of trust that are unique for telemedicine: Trust in healthcare professionals and trust in treatment, which were identified from existing research and confirmed by participants; and trust in patients, which emerged as an important antecedent of trust for participating professionals. These factors are also not listed in overviews of factors that affect trust in online health information, where usability and rich, unbiased information play a crucial role [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>]. This study suggests that when designing trustworthy telemedicine portals for rehabilitation care, we cannot rely solely on the existing models that inform us how to design trustworthy eServices or reliable online health information. Rather, future research should develop a complete, validated set of design heuristics for this context.</Para>

                <Heading>Design guidelines for a trustworthy telemedicine portal for rehabilitation care</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par77">First meetings between a patient and healthcare professional should be done in a face-to-face setting, as this is the moment where the patient largely determines his or her trust in the healthcare professional. For healthcare professionals, this meeting also establishes the trust in portal technology. It is during this meeting that they first see a patients’ electronic dossier and have to determine whether it is correct and complete. While this advice may seem obvious, we are also witnessing the rise of fully self-help Internet health interventions [e.g., <CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>]. It is important to remind ourselves that the loss of a first face-to-face meeting in such interventions may have a detrimental effect on patient trust.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par78">Patients look for several cues to determine their trust in a rehabilitation portal: A secure Internet connection, a familiar logo (of the healthcare organization providing the technology), the option to alter login credentials and personal data, and a personal approach (e.g., a homepage with the patient’s name). The importance of these cues for building online trust has already been identified for other types of websites [<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef>], and we have found that these cues also play a role for rehabilitation portals. Professionals also focus on several trust-increasing cues. Specifically, they focus on the presence of their name on the homepage (which ensures a sense of personal responsibility), and automatically being logged out after a period of inactivity. Next, they want the guarantee that patient data cannot be read by an outsider, for example by informing them about the policy on this point. Ideally, this should be done by complying with international standards, such as ISO [<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">39</CitationRef>] or EN [<CitationRef CitationID="CR40">40</CitationRef>], and by informing professionals of this.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par79">Two related topics that came up several times during the focus groups were data access and control. Among both patients and healthcare professionals there appears to be a group of people that desires the possibility to select those organizations that are allowed to access patient data. We think this should be seen as a call for developers of telemedicine portals to provide patients with fine-grained mechanisms for controlling which party is allowed to view, store and/or use different types of patient data (health data, sensor data, etc.).</Para>
                <Para ID="Par80">Some trust cues may work counter-effectively. Official, national authentication mechanisms can decrease trust, due to negative media publicity, as was the case for DigiD, the Dutch, national authentication mechanism. Disclaimers, which other researchers have found to increase trust [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>], were seen by the participants in our focus groups as a bad excuse for bad design.</Para>

                <Heading>Using sensor and patient-generated data to inform treatment in rehabilitation care</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par81">Healthcare professionals were highly concerned about the quality of sensor data. They thought activity sensors were inferior devices, as single sensors could not assess different kinds of activities (e.g., walking and ironing) and lacked the option to record contextual information. As a result, many of them did not want to use them for informing patient treatment. This would explain why we have witnessed professionals’ reluctance to use such sensors in the past [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>]. The versatility of activity sensor data should be improved before it will be trusted and used by healthcare professionals in rehabilitation care. Special attention should be paid to including contextual information and effective sensing of a wide range of human activities.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par82">Finally, it was an interesting result for us that healthcare professionals do not always trust the information that patients provide. They think that some patients lack the skills needed to give good information or are not honest to them. Furthermore, they also do not trust the data provided by sensors worn by patients. It is therefore important that we devise a way of communicating trustworthiness of patient-generated data for healthcare professionals.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par83">The setup of this focus group study was geared towards eliciting the different factors and design considerations for creating end-user trust in rehabilitation portals. We took an explorative approach as only little work has been done on the topic so far. Our results should therefore be seen as a starting point for determining, statistically, which factors exactly make up trust in such portals, and the importance of each factor. The same holds for the creation of guidelines for designing for trust in rehabilitation portals. Future research should acknowledge and expand these findings.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par84">We have focused, in this study, on what makes up ‘trusting beliefs’ (perceptions of specific attributes of an eService provider [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]) about a rehabilitation portal. Trusting beliefs are a first step in actually performing the desired trusting behavior, and things might go wrong along the way (e.g., a patient may have a favorable opinion of a rehabilitation portal and might have the intention to trust it as well, but loses this trust during a complicated registration procedure after which the patient decides not to trust and use the portal after all). Mapping the full life-cycle of trust formation and behavior is important to fully understand the role of trust. This, however, was outside the scope of this study and a longitudinal, observational study would be far more suitable for this goal than conducting focus groups. However, this work has laid the foundations for such a study.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par85">The context in which this study has taken place is rehabilitation care. Results from this study may, therefore, not hold for other care contexts (such as primary care or mental care). The participating patients sometimes suffered from ‘misunderstood complaints’. Their condition was difficult to diagnose and therefore these patients have quite some history in healthcare, which may have affected their trust in healthcare professionals or care institutes. Other professions, such as general practitioners or dentists may have other views when it comes to trusting their patients and the technology they use during their work. Future research should determine to what degree the results we found are similar for other care contexts.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par86">Finally, the example that was used as a conversation starter during the focus groups was a specific instance of a portal for rehabilitation care (that includes medical information, an electronic patient file, remote exercising, and the use of sensor technology). The collection of features that is unique for this portal may have influenced results and we should be cautious with generalizing results to other health or rehabilitation portals with a distinctly different set of functionalities.</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusions</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par87">In this study, we have explored the coming about of patient and healthcare professionals’ trust in a telemedicine portal for rehabilitation care. The resulting factors that affect trust are quite different from the factors that influence trust in other domains, like eCommerce [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR42">42</CitationRef>] or eGovernment [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. This implies that the concept of trust is distinctively different for healthcare and telemedicine portals than for other contexts, and should be dealt with in a specific manner in research and portal design. Different factors should be taken into account (e.g., trust in care organizations) and design should incorporate a set of design cues that are proven to be beneficial for trust in a rehabilitation portal (the list we present in this article can serve as a first start). Our next step is to take the models of trust that we have presented, to translate them into questionnaires, and to test and refine them on a large scale with patients and healthcare professionals. This way, we will also be able to say which factors have the most importance.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par88">Finally, patients and healthcare professionals voiced different preferences regarding different actors and organizations storing and viewing their data and we found that providing them with control over these rights would increase trust. This strengthens the call to telemedicine developers to develop privacy-enhancing technology that allows end-users to control their data in a usable manner [<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef>].</Para>
