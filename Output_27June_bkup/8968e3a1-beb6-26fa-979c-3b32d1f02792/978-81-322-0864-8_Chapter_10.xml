          <Para TextBreak="No">A particular test should be widely accepted by scientific community and be able to predict the effects of wide range of chemicals on different organisms. Toxicity testing methods have been designed from time to time using different procedures. Acute toxicity describes the adverse effects of a substance that result either from a single exposure or from multiple exposures in a short space of time. In order to be described as acute toxicity, the adverse effects should occur within 14 days of the administration of the substance. Acute toxicity is distinguished from chronic toxicity, which describes the adverse health effects from repeated exposures, often at lower levels, to a substance over a longer time period (months or years). The objective of acute toxicity test is to determine the concentration of a test material or the level of an agent that produces a deleterious effect on a group of test organisms during a short-term exposure under controlled conditions. LC50 is statistical estimate of dose necessary to kill 50% of a large population of test species under stated conditions. Experimentally this is achieved by administering a chemical at graded doses to a group of organisms and then observing the resultant mortalities in a set time period, 96h and so on. Among animals, rats, mice, rabbits, guinea pigs and hamsters are the test species. Subacute toxicity study aims to find out toxic effect of drug on repeated exposure and also provide the valuable information, that is, delayed effect which may result due to the cumulative effect of the chemicals on the tissues or other biochemical mechanisms. General Lab Practice (GLP) is concerned with the organisational process and the conditions under which laboratory studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded and reported. GLP is concerned with the organisational process and the conditions under which laboratory studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded and reported. The GLP requirements deal with all related aspects of testing, namely, personnel, facilities, equipment, laboratory operations, test chemicals, protocols, reports and disqualification of testing facilities.</Para>

In acute toxicity, the adverse effects should occur within 14 days of the administration of the substance.

              <Para TextBreak="No">The objective of acute toxicity test is to determine the concentration of a test material (e.g. chemical or effluent) or the level of an agent (e.g. temperature or pH) that produces a deleterious effect on a group of test organisms during a short-term exposure under controlled conditions. Although toxicity tests with aquatic organisms can be conducted by administering the material directly by injection or incorporating it into food, most tests are conducted by exposure groups of organisms to several treatments in which different concentrations of the material are mixed with water. Because death is easily detected deleterious response, the most common acute toxicity test is the acute lethality test. Experimentally, a 50% response is the most reproducible measure of a test material, and 96 h is the standard exposure time because it covers the period of acute lethal action. Therefore, the measurement of acute toxicity used with fish and macro invertebrates is 96-h median lethal concentration (96-h LC50).</Para>

            <Heading>Single Species (Indicator) Tests</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Current test methods are designed predominately to examine the responses of few individuals within a species. The response of an ecosystem consisting of interacting species is assumed to be predictable from single species toxicity tests. Most single species test are conducted in laboratory. These tests can provide a great deal of information on the concentration of chemicals and duration of exposure that produces changes in mortality, growth, reproduction, pathology, behaviour, physiology and biochemistry of organisms within species.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Cause and effect relationships can be established from single species tests because of degree of control over laboratory conditions. These tests are easy to conduct, and many are standardised and can be replicated. Current single species tests are conducted with individual species that are considered representative of broad classes of organisms so that the results provide information of toxicity of specific chemicals in different type of organisms under given conditions. Test species included are algae, crustaceans, fish etc. in aquatic systems. Single species laboratory tests cannot account for the adaptive ability of natural populations of organisms. Effects observed in laboratory tests thus appear more severe than those seen in field. Even then single species tests have yielded results that are well correlated with the observed ecological effects of chemicals.</Para>

            <Heading>Multispecies Tests (Community Structure)</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">These may be conducted in laboratory. These studies involve laboratory microcosms or model ecosystems. Laboratory microcosms are small-scale enclosures containing samples from natural ecosystem. Their advantage is that effects beyond the level of single species can be identified, providing information more directly related to ecological consequences of chemicals. In principle, if conditions are uniform, these tests should be easy to standardise and replicate. Since environmental influences are controlled, cause and effect relationship are more easily analysed than in natural systems. However, microcosms are oversimplifications of natural ecosystems. An excellent example of totally defined, material closed microcosm is performed test with 24 replicates using a total of 10 species of algae, 5 species of animals and unknown number of bacteria.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Acute toxicity tests have been conducted with industrial effluents for more than 40 years. Acute toxicity tests can be defined as the severe effects suffered by organisms from short-term exposure to toxic chemicals. These tests are designed to determine the dose or concentration of a particular test, chemical or effluent or the level of an agent that will produce a specific response on a group of test organisms during short-term exposure under controlled conditions. Since death is easily detected response, the most common acute toxicity test is the acute lethality test. The other two tests are irritation studies and potentiation or sensitising agents.</Para>

            <Heading>Lethality (LC50 or LD50)</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">This is one of the common ways to express acute toxicity. LC50 is statistical estimate of dose necessary to kill 50% of a large population of test species under stated conditions. Experimentally this is achieved by administering a chemical at graded doses to a group of organisms and then observing the resultant mortalities in a set time period, 96 h and so on. Among animals, rats, mice, rabbits, guinea pigs and hamsters are the test species. The measure of acute toxicity most frequently used with fish and microinvertebrates is the 96-h median lethal concentration. However, because death is not easily determined for some invertebrates, an EC50 is estimated rather than LC50.The effect used for estimating the EC50 with invertebrates like daphnids and midge larvae is immobilisation, that is, lack of movement. For EC50 of crabs, crayfish and shrimp, effects used are immobilisation and loss of equilibrium, defined as inability to maintain normal pressure. Among plants, algae and duckweed (Lemna spp.) have been used as test organisms.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Acute toxicity tests methods may be categorised according to length of exposure, test situation, criteria of effects and test organisms. The data used in this test are used to determine the NOEC (no observed effect concentration or no effect concentration ), which is maximum concentration of the test material that produces no statistically significant harmful effect on test organisms as compared to controls in a specific test, and LOEC (lowest observed effect concentration) or MTC (minimum threshold concentration) which is the lowest concentration that has statistically significant deleterious effect on test organisms compared to control in a specific test. In the early times of acute toxicity tests, data were expressed as the median tolerance limit (TLm or TL50)—the test material concentration at which 50% of test organism survive for a specific exposure time (usually 24–96 h). This term is now replaced by median lethal concentration (EC50).</Para>

Chemicals when applied to skin or mucous membrane lead to tissue alteration of various types. The tests used indicate the propensity of a compound to cause tissue irritation and damage. When applied to eye, the tissue response may be severe and may lead to other toxic manifestations such as corneal damage and blindness. If inhaled, it may destroy tissue in respiratory tract. These tests are generally conducted in rabbits and guinea pigs, leading to damage of mucous membrane. An awareness of the primary tissue response for a specific chemical could alert individuals to handle the chemical with proper care.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">The term potentiation or sensitisation means that when two chemicals are acting on same or different organs or systems, one chemical is made more effective in the presence of other chemical. This potential sensitising effect of chemical agents could become a major problem to toxicologists. The primary irritant elicits its effects immediately on its application. The sensitising agent may show no primary irritation but when applied or injected may combine with a protein molecule and acts as an antigenic agent. This in turn produces antibodies. If the compound is applied again or injected, an antigen antibody reaction may occur, producing either minor or serious allergic conditions which could lead to death or crippling illness. The tests are generally conducted on guinea pig, where the animal is first introduced to the chemical and then challenged by additional doses of the compound. Tissue response develops at the site of injection or elsewhere.</Para>

Generally, concentrations that produce chronic effects are lower than those that produce more readily observable acute effects such as mortality. Therefore, chronic toxicity tests can provide a more sensitive measure of chemical toxicity than acute toxicity tests. Three categories of tests are commonly used to predict the chronic and subchronic effects of toxic chemicals on organisms: (1) life cycle toxicity tests, (2) sensitive early stages tests and (3) functional tests.</Para>

            <Heading>Full Life Cycle Tests</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">These are typical chronic tests. These tests measure the effects of chronic exposure to a chemical on reproduction, growth, survival and other parameters over one or more generations of a population of test organisms. Groups of test organisms are exposed to a series of concentrations of test chemical. Chronic or full life cycle toxicity test is an important tool for understanding and evaluating the potential hazard of toxicants to organisms. A chronic toxicity test can indicate the concentrations of a chemical that will interfere with normal growth, development and attainment of reproductive potential of organism. The concentrations that produce chronic effects are lower than those producing more readily observable acute effects such as mortality. Therefore, chronic toxicity tests could provide a more sensitive measure of chemical toxicity than acute toxicity tests. The duration of test varies with the species tested. It is approximately 21 days for water flea, and it can be 275–300 days for the fathead minnow. In fish, each of the several groups of individuals of one species is exposed to a different concentration of a toxicant throughout a life cycle to study the effect of toxicant on survival, growth and reproduction of the species.</Para>

The most sensitive stages are used to predict chronic toxicity of chemicals to organisms. Most vertebrates’ life cycle toxicity tests have been conducted in fish. In early life stages test, most sensitive life stages thus measure the effect of chronic exposure on survival and growth of the most sensitive life stages, as eggs and larva of fish. Relatively a short exposure of the embryo-larval and early juvenile stages of fish to a toxicant can be used to estimate MATC without a complete life cycle test. These tests thus include continuous exposure of the ELS (e.g. egg, embryo, larva and fry) of aquatic organisms to various concentrations of a chemical for 1–2 months depending upon species.

            <Heading>Functional Tests</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">These tests measure the chronic toxicity of chemicals through various physiological functions or functional responses of organisms. Functional responses include physiological and behavioural responses as affected due to exposure of sublethal concentrations of toxic chemicals. Different organisms when exposed to toxicants change blood chemistry, histology, swimming performance, avoidance, respiration, enzyme activities, sensory perception and disease resistance.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Functional tests are also used in studies on bioaccumulation and biotransformation process. Many of the functional responses are sensitive indicators of sublethal toxic effects.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Behaviour is the observable, recordable or measureable activities of a living animal. It is everything an animal does, including all of its integrated movements. Animal behavioural patterns are highly adaptive to environmental variables of physical, chemical or biological nature. Chemical agents may also be behaviourally toxic in organisms. Behavioural toxicity occurs when the introduction of a chemical induces a behavioural change that exceeds the normal range of variability. Most behavioural toxicity tests have been made on fish and other aquatic organisms.</Para>

                <Emphasis Type="Italic">Lysosomal Stability</Emphasis>. Lysosomes are organelles responsible for the breakdown of exogenous and endogenous substrates in animal cells. A good regulation system of permeability of lysosome membrane is needed to prevent catalytic enzymes from entering the cytoplasm. Under conditions of low chemical stress, only small molecules can penetrate the membrane into the lysosome; under serious stress, larger molecules may pass the membrane. A number of xenobiotics may accumulate in the lysosome as a result of low biodegradability.</Para>

The MFO system is membrane-bound non-phosphorylating electron transport complex that normally forms part of endoplasmic reticulum. The system metabolises natural substrates (steroids, fatty acids) as well as xenobiotics, including pesticides. One of the MFO components is the iron-containing cytochrome P450. The compound neotetrazolium (NTR) is also able to accept electrons from cytochrome P450 in this manner. Thus, NTR reduction may be used as a measure for MFO activity in the hepatopancreas tubuli as well as in blood cells. The quantitative determination of the NTR-reduction products can be carried out with a microdensiometer.</Para>

Metal ions are easily bound by cysteine, counteracting toxic effects. Induction of metallothionein synthesis in animals as mussels takes place in various tissues as gills, mantle and especially hepatopancreas after exposure to Cd, Cu and Zn.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Reproduction toxicity is interference by an agent with the reproductive processes in one or more ways. The toxicant may lead to malformation in children, reduce chance of conception, may be embryocidal, cause stillbirth or death of the progeny. Since the incidence of malformation from thalidomide in children, reproduction toxicity and teratogenic studies became part of safety evaluation of new drugs and chemicals.</Para>

            <Heading>Bioassay in Toxicity Testing</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Bioassay is frequently used in toxicity tests, chiefly aquatic toxicity. A bioassay is a test to evaluate the relative potency of a chemical by comparing its effect on a living organism with that of a standard preparation. A bioassay is performed to determine the strength of the chemical from the degree of response produced by a specific level of stimulus. Bioassays are frequently used in the pharmaceutical industry to evaluate the potency of vitamins and other pharmacologically active compounds. Bioassay is thus a test in which organisms are used to detect the presence or the effects of physicochemical factors in the environment. The test involves exposure of animal to the toxicants for a definite period in the static laboratory environment and observing survival or other symptoms during a period of 96 h or so.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">GLP is concerned with the organisational process and the conditions under which laboratory studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded and reported. The GLP requirements deals with all related aspects of testing, namely, personnel, facilities, equipment, laboratory operations, test chemicals, protocols, reports and disqualification of testing facilities.</Para>

          <Heading>Cumulative Toxicity</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">There is no consistent relationship between the acute and chronic toxicity because the course of death after a single high dose may be entirely different from that encountered after repeated administration of subacute doses. Species with biotransformation similar to that in average man is selected for test of cumulative toxicity. The duration of the toxic effects of drug or chemical varies with the rate of metabolic detoxification and elimination. If this is not complete or almost complete by 24 h then a second dose is given in multidose studies, the toxic effects of the first dose will be added in part to those of the second dose, producing cumulative toxicity.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The use of 100-day LD50 index for the cumulative toxicity evaluation of chemicals and drugs has been suggested. There are given daily doses with increasing fractions of the acute LD50. Percent mortalities from each daily dose are tabulated at weekly intervals. From these, LD1, LD50 and LD99 calculated at 100 days are referred to as LD50 (100 days). The 100-day LD50 index is calculated by expressing the LD50 (100 days) as percentage of the acute LD50 (1 dose), that is,<Equation ID="Equa">
