              <Para TextBreak="No">Since its origins in the early twentieth century, occupational health psychology has transformed into an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary fields focused on promoting healthy workers and healthy organizations. Through this period of growth, many theories were developed that have guided much of the research in identifying environmental and psychosocial risk factors for negative health outcomes in the workplace. A central focus has been placed on stress and its adverse effects on outcomes, such as productivity, job satisfaction, and employee health. Additionally, stress management interventions have become the mainstay for successful preventative occupational health programs. National organizations have also emerged to help support researchers in the development and implementation of workplace interventions. Overall, the field has made great strides and is primed for further investigation into such topics as the bidirectional relationships between organizational health and employee health, the reciprocal influence of other life roles on work stress, and the broader dissemination of practices that have demonstrated effectiveness in occupational health settings.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">With the above preamble in mind, it should be noted that the prevention of work-related illnesses is not just a matter of physical safety anymore. The health and well-being of modern day employees demands an interdisciplinary approach including psychology, medicine, business, and engineering (Maclean, Plotnikoff, &amp; Moyer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000381">2000</CitationRef>). The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified ­psychosocial ­factors as major occupational health concerns, in addition to problems associated with exposure to biochemical and physical hazards and unemployment (WHO, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003131">2007</CitationRef>). The field of occupational health psychology is growing in practice and acceptance to answer this need. Now, an institutionalized discipline, occupational health psychology has produced multiple handbooks and journals including <Emphasis Type="Italic">Stress</Emphasis> (Cox, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000324">1978</CitationRef>), <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Journal of Occupational Health Psychology</Emphasis> (American Psychological Association [APA], 1996), <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Handbook of Occupational Health Psychology</Emphasis> (Quick &amp; Tetrick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000395">2003</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000396">2010</CitationRef>), and now the current <Emphasis Type="Italic">Handbook of Occupational Health and Wellness</Emphasis> (Gatchel &amp; Schultz, 2012).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">While the term organizational health used to refer to the resilience and strength of an organization, occupational health psychologists have expanded that definition to include, if not emphasize, the health of the employees within an organization (Tetrick &amp; Quick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003120">2003</CitationRef>). The prevention of illness or injury and the promotion of the physical, mental, and social well-being of employees is now the ultimate objective of occupational health researchers and practitioners alike. As such, the field has benefited from a positive health platform including healthy leadership practices, awareness of stress, strain and stressors, and a push toward proactive interventions (Tetrick &amp; Quick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003121">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The American Institute of Stress elevated work stress to an epidemic in the first part of this century based on self-reports, unscheduled absence data, violent incidents at work, and job loss statistics (Rosch, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000398">2001</CitationRef>). Sadly, the statistics are both supportive of this designation and startling. Now more than ever, American workers have reported that they are more stressed over money and workplace concerns due the tumultuous economy. According to a recent survey, the percentage of employees that reported stress due to job instability increased from 42 % in 2008 to 49 % in 2010 (APA, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00034">2010</CitationRef>). Furthermore, a startling 76 % of workers reported feeling stress and anxiety about money, while 70 % reported feeling stressed about work. The medical field points to stress for 60–90 % of all illnesses, as 75–80 % of Americans reported that their jobs are very or extremely stressful (American Institute of Stress, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00033">2007</CitationRef>; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH], <CitationRef CitationID="CR000388">2007</CitationRef>). In this chapter, we briefly describe the emergence of occupational health psychology to date. Then, the changing nature of work due to the emergence of technology and globalization is discussed. Lastly, we will review common workplace stressors, the theoretical models of workplace stress, and how we can utilize our body of knowledge in a preventative framework. Many of these issues will be discussed in greater detail in other chapters of this handbook.</Para>

              <Heading>A Historical Perspective of Occupational Health Psychology</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Healthy organizations, a term once used to describe companies that financially survive and cope with the turbulent ups and downs of the economy, have now taken a broader meaning that includes the health and wellness of the company’s employees. While the origins of organizational health psychology date back to the early twentieth century, it was not until the American Psychological Association (APA) and the United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) jointly identified ­job-related psychological disorders as one of the top ten employee health concerns, that the larger majority of organizations really began to understand the concern (Sauter, Murphy, &amp; Hurrell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003102">1990</CitationRef>). At present, most researchers ascribe to the World Health Organization’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0003130">1948</CitationRef>) definition that health is not just an absence from disease. In fact, the discipline of organizational health psychology has expanded to include the social, physical, and psychological well-being of employees that results in optimal functioning (Hofmann &amp; Tetrick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000349">2003</CitationRef>; Macik-Frey, Quick, &amp; Nelson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000380">2007</CitationRef>; Schaufeli, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003104">2004</CitationRef>). However, throughout history, health has not always been a priority for organizational researchers.</Para>

                <Heading>The Principles of Scientific Management</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The idea that work is a potential source of stress, illness, and physical strain began to appear in the literature detailing the dehumanizing mentality of factories in the late nineteenth century (Barling &amp; Griffiths, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00039">2010</CitationRef>; Engels, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000334">1845/1987</CitationRef>; Marx, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000383">1967</CitationRef>/1845). One of the early organizational researchers that contributed to the mechanistic, dehumanizing perspective of factory workers was Fredrick Taylor, who authored the book, <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Principles of Scientific Management</Emphasis> (1911). In his book, Taylor suggested that factories could increase efficiency by taking control and discretion away from the employees. He was the first to compartmentalize workers into those that “think about work” and those that “do the work.” Within the scientific management approach, one level of employees, the managers, would have control to plan what the other level of employees had to do, with no input from the employees themselves. In fact, many of the managers had been promoted from the ranks and had received little to no proper training as leaders. These newly appointed managers were given complete control over the workplace and were allowed to hire and fire employees at their own discretion, and were in charge of determining production and pay. The scientific management philosophy did not view the workers as humans but rather as machines. This type of work environment degraded the front-line employees and likely created a lot of stress, dissention, and illness.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Following the period of scientific management, a new approach was developed that focused more on the physical and psychological needs of the individual workers. Termed the human relations approach, this new leadership style allowed workers to be active participants in the decision-making processes of the organization (Schultz &amp; Schultz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003105">2010</CitationRef>). Research conducted following the period of scientific management has redirected the current focus in occupational health psychology on increasing worker control and taking into account employees’ emotions.</Para>

              <Section2 ID="Sec00034">
                <Heading>The Hawthorne Effect</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">One of the first organizational psychology experiments to gain widespread attention was conducted by the Western Electric Company in Hawthorne, Illinois (Mayo, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000386">1933</CitationRef>, Roethlisberger &amp; Dickson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000397">1939</CitationRef>). Elton Mayo, an Industrial Research professor at Harvard University developed a series of experiments to evaluate how physical factors of the work environment affected work production. In efforts to maximize productivity, the working conditions were manipulated by altering the amount of light in the factory. The hope was to identify the optimal amount of light that factory workers needed to be most productive; however, the results of these studies were rather surprising. Researchers ­discovered that any change to the working conditions resulted in an increase in productivity. For example, when the researchers dimmed the lights by measurable increments, productivity increased. However, when the researchers then increased the light emitted within the factory, productivity continued to increase. Soon enough, it was apparent that the employees responded to the increased attention they felt from being the focus of an experiment, a phenomenon now appropriately referred to as the “Hawthorne Effect.” Notably, this series of studies were critical to the human relations movement; managers and researchers began to understand the human side of employment. Counter to Taylor’s scientific management model that essentially removed emotions and attitudes from the workplace, the focus began to shift to the promotion of happy, healthy workers.</Para>

                <Heading>Occupational Health Researchers</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">About 10 years after the ground-breaking Hawthorne studies, other areas of psychology were also highlighting the importance of motivation and mental health. For instance, Maslow published his theory of self-actualization that emphasized the importance of meeting the basic human needs before expecting employees to reach their full potential (Maslow, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000385">1943</CitationRef>). Similarly, Herzberg (1966) argued that increased productivity and satisfaction could be obtained by perfecting job design and providing realistic challenges and ongoing recognition. These ideas laid the groundwork for later models such as the Person-Environment Fit Model (Edwards &amp; Cooper, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000332">1990</CitationRef>; French, Caplan, &amp; Van Harrison, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000338">1982</CitationRef>; Kahn, Wolfe, Quinn, Snoek, &amp; Rosenthal, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000358">1964</CitationRef>; Lofquist &amp; Dawis, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000379">1969</CitationRef>), Demand–Control Model (Karasek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000360">1979</CitationRef>; Karasek &amp; Theorell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000362">1990</CitationRef>), and Effort–Reward Model (Siegrist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003112">1996</CitationRef>). These models will be further discussed later in the chapter.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Along with the increased interest in the ideal working conditions that support health and well-being, European researchers were also starting to investigate the impact of job design, job decision latitude (control), and job demands. In a series of studies, a psychologist by the name of Bertil Gardell posited that Taylor’s scientific management approach created withdrawal and alienation within workforces (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000341">1971</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000342">1977</CitationRef>). Without a concern for the humanistic side of the employees, work became monotonous and fragmented and the workers felt isolated and underappreciated. Researchers then began to understand the influence of psychosocial work factors on health outcomes. For example, factors such as person–environment fit, role ambiguity, and role-conflict were empirically linked to the development of coronary heart disease (Katz &amp; Kahn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000363">1966</CitationRef>).</Para>

In the book entitled <Emphasis Type="Italic">Healthy Work</Emphasis>, Karasek and Theorell (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000362">1990</CitationRef>) suggested that the same psychosocial components of work that were important for satisfaction were also strongly associated with increased job performance. Furthermore, this work highlighted the importance of the ratio between job demands and job control when predicting work-related stress with workers who had low control and high demand experiencing the most stress and health problems (Barling &amp; Griffiths, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00039">2010</CitationRef>; Theorell &amp; Karasek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003122">1996</CitationRef>). These findings were the impetus for a large body of research that has since demonstrated that factors which predict better physical and psychosocial health also promote increased productivity and better organizational outcomes.

                <Para TextBreak="No">Standing on the shoulders of so many years of research, multiple national organizations have been organized and continue to play a significant role in the development of organizational health psychology. Since the 1990s, the United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has supported research to ensure that working conditions remain safe for USA employees. NIOSH has developed strategies to promote and protect the psychological well-being of employees based on the recommendations of researchers in the field. Further, NIOSH has partnered with another well-known organization, the American Psychological Association (APA), to fund organizational health graduate programs, as well as international conferences that have continued to promote work in this area. Another well-known organization in the field of occupational health is the Institute of Work, Health and Organisations (I-WHO). I-WHO has made significant contributions, particularly within the field of work stress (e.g., Cox, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000324">1978</CitationRef>). Utilizing the Cognitive Appraisal Model (Lazarus, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000371">1966</CitationRef>; Lazarus &amp; Folkman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000372">1984</CitationRef>; to be discussed in detail later in the chapter) as the basis of reasoning, the I-WHO concentrates on the processes through which people evaluate an event as being stressful or not. With this approach, Cox, the lead researcher, catalyzed a risk-management approach to understanding work stress.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Throughout the history of occupational health psychology there has been a flux of ideas. The field started with a focus on increased worker productivity that, in turn, decreased employee participation and ignored the psychological well-being of the employees. In stark contrast, today, the focus includes environmental and psychosocial factors that not only improve employee well-being and health but also ultimately increase productivity. These changes have been attributed to a number of prominent researchers throughout many disciplines and around the globe that have been supported by leading organizations devoted to enhancing occupational health. One influential factor in this climate change has been the changing nature of today’s work environments.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Throughout the growth of organizational health psychology as a discipline, researchers have had to shift gears as the nature of work continues to evolve. The revolutionizing world of technology is arguably the most influential factor in the changing nature of work. With every new technological advancement, job design, task duties, competition, and work conditions are affected in just about every industry all over the world. The competitive market is far more dynamic than it was at the birth of occupational health psychology.</Para>

                <Heading>Technology</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Advancements in manufacturing technology have led to quicker and more efficient production, but have also placed higher demands on individual employees. One of the most noticeable shifts is the increase, over the past 50 years, in the number of service and professional jobs that are largely computer-driven (Tetrick &amp; Quick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003121">2010</CitationRef>). While there are still jobs that require rudimentary skill and physical endurance, there are now many more jobs that are cognitively demanding. Advances in technology have also been associated with organizational downsizing and restructuring, which have resulted in smaller work teams that are often required to deal with more ambiguity rather than doing the same task every day. Similarly, there are also more managerial jobs as teams have become more specialized. For instance, instead of one first-line supervisor for every 100 employees working on an assembly line, it is not uncommon for organizations to now operate with one manager for every ten departmental employees. This organizational structure translates to more managers with the added stress of managing and developing others (Sulsky &amp; Smith, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003113">2005</CitationRef>). Likewise, the role of the leader has become much more personal and influential for the employees. Rather than perceive a supervisor and company as one unifying source of stress, the more personal social-exchange relationships that occur with smaller work teams allows employees to distinguish between the two potential sources of stress (Lavelle, Brockner, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000368">2009</CitationRef>; Lavelle, McMahan, &amp; Harris, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000369">2009</CitationRef>). Research has demonstrated that now the organization and the manager often serve as two individual sources of stress that interact with one another (Graham, Lopez, &amp; Dougall, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000343">2008</CitationRef>; Greenberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000345">2004</CitationRef>). Furthermore, these studies indicated that the leader is often the most influential source of stress for employees over and above other organizational influences.</Para>

On the other hand, globalization also increases the number of competitors, decreases job security, increases workforce diversity, and increases the amount of stress for individual employees. Increased levels of stress are often observed because of the circumstances surrounding globalization such as job-relocation, job-reassignment, unemployment, cultural clashes, and difficulties communicating (Brislin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000314">2008</CitationRef>; Sharma &amp; Sharma, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003109">2010</CitationRef>).

For instance, rather than physical ailments and chemical exposures, most of the major threats to our modern workforce are chronic, degenerative diseases that are much more difficult to detect (Levi, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000376">2011</CitationRef>). Unfortunately, stress has been shown to be either the cause or an accelerator to both short- and long-term illnesses, even life-threatening diseases (Dougall &amp; Baum, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000329">2012</CitationRef>; Levi, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000376">2011</CitationRef>). Furthermore, the relationship between work and stress, or rather the common outcomes of stress, such as illness, turnover and accidents, has been well established in the literature (Greenberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000346">2010</CitationRef>; Lax, Grant, Maanetti, &amp; Klein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000370">1998</CitationRef>).

              <Para TextBreak="No">A prominent focus of occupational health research is to identify the factors that contribute to job-related stress and to understand how those factors affect the employees’ health and occupational outcomes. The factors often considered by occupational health psychologists can be viewed from a job-specific approach, such that the job itself is hazardous and stressful, or from a psychosocial approach, such that leadership, organizational support, and perceived equity can have a negative effect on health and occupational outcomes. The following section will provide an overview of the various occupational factors that have been found to not only contribute to poor health and illness but also to be linked with poor occupational outcomes, such as low job satisfaction, productivity and organizational commitment, higher rates of absenteeism, and turnover.</Para>

                <Heading>Workplace Characteristics</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The physical work environment is a major factor that affects not only the health and safety of the organization’s employees, but it also can influence general job satisfaction and productivity. Various elements within the work environment have been researched and found to contribute to employee stress. Environmental factors, such as lighting, noise, and temperature, have been identified to have significant effects on productivity and job satisfaction. Also, employee work schedules have been studied to determine what types of schedules are beneficial or detrimental to productivity and health. Likewise, efforts have been made to reduce the likelihood of illnesses and injuries on the job that can often be prevented. Organizational health researchers have examined such stressors to identify what types of professions and individuals are at higher risks of adverse outcomes. Through this process, occupational health researchers can then create prevention and intervention strategies to reduce and eliminate harmful effects from poorly designed workplace environments.</Para>
                <Section3 ID="Sec000315">
                  <Heading>Physical Working Conditions</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Environmental work factors have been systematically studied within various industries to determine the effects on employees’ health, stress levels, and productivity. The physical working conditions commonly studied in occupational health psychology can include general workplace conditions, such as noise, lighting and temperature, but have also focused on the physical demands for the job. These physical demands include exposure to noxious materials and dangerous work environments, which have been correlated with long-term illnesses, disabilities, and fatalities. Again, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a federally funded agency that conducts research and develops recommendations and guidelines for prevention of workplace injuries and illnesses, has sponsored numerous studies on workplace factors such as noise, lighting, and temperature. One factor that has been investigated extensively in the work-place settings is noise. Not only has noise been shown to affect productivity at work by causing distractions and increasing errors (Evans &amp; Johnson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000335">2000</CitationRef>), but exposure to noise, both high levels and prolonged duration, has been linked with permanent hearing loss and chronic stress (Morata, Byrne, &amp; Rabinowitz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000387">2011</CitationRef>; Szalma &amp; Hancock, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003114">2011</CitationRef>). Another element of the workplace that has been studied considerably in the field of industrial and occupational health is lighting. In fact, high intensity, poor distribution, glare, and artificial sources of light have been correlated with decreased employee job satisfaction, lower productivity, poor vision and increased workplace injuries (Anshel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00035">2006</CitationRef>; Juslen, Wouters, &amp; Tenner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000356">2007</CitationRef>; Schultz &amp; Schultz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003105">2010</CitationRef>). Temperature is another work-place factor that has been broadly studied by occupational health researchers. In a poll asking office employees about their physical work conditions, the top two complaints were that it was either too cold or too hot (Schultz &amp; Schultz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003105">2010</CitationRef>). While some studies have evaluated the effects of moderate changes within the workplace on job satisfaction and morale (Lan, Lian, &amp; Pan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000367">2010</CitationRef>), others have focused on the negative health effects associated with prolonged exposure to extreme temperature conditions (Bortkiewicz et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000313">2006</CitationRef>; Kovats &amp; Hajat, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000365">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Exposure to hazardous substances is another factor within the workplace that is considered to be stressful to employees. For example, individuals who work in mining, textiles, industrial chemicals, and oil refinery are often exposed to chemicals linked with various lung cancers and other terminal diseases. Medical technicians and power plant workers who are exposed to radiation are at increased risks of various cancers, including thyroid, lung and bone cancer (Schultz &amp; Schultz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003105">2010</CitationRef>). First responders are oftentimes exposed to harmful environmental conditions during rescue and recovery efforts and can experience injuries, respiratory illness, skin irritations, and the like (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000317">2002</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000318">2006</CitationRef>). The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) was passed in 1970 to enforce federal standards ensuring that preventative safety measures are in place to reduce and eliminate the likelihood of diseases and accidents in the workplace. Mandatory provision of personal protective equipment to employees has greatly reduced the incidence of hazardous exposure (Howie, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000351">2008</CitationRef>), but other factors also play a role in worker safety.</Para>

                  <Heading>Scheduling Factors</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">A substantial amount of research has been conducted on productivity, safety, and satisfaction of employees whose work schedules fall out of the typical 9-to-5 days. Occupational health researchers have evaluated the extent to which changes in traditional work schedules not only affects stress and health outcomes for the employee but also relates to changes in productivity and injuries on the job. The Fair Labor Standards Act was passed in 1938 (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0003124">US Department of Labor</CitationRef>) which established the 5-day, 40 h-per-week work schedule for all employees. However, alternative schedules have become more prominent in recent years. Part-time work, for example, has been correlated with reduced stress and burnout in higher-stress professions. Other variations to traditional scheduling, such as a 4-day workweek, telecommuting and flexible work schedules, have also been linked with improved productivity and job satisfaction (Schultz &amp; Schultz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003105">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">On the other hand, research on shift work has been shown to have negative effects on health and productivity (this topic will be discussed in greater detail in another chapter of the handbook). The disruption of the circadian rhythm for shift workers is directly linked to changes in physiological functions, such as body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure (Sulsky &amp; Smith, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003113">2005</CitationRef>). In fact, gastrointestinal disorders, specifically gastric ulcers, are more prevalent in night-time and rotating shift workers as compared to those with traditional daytime schedules (Costa, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000323">1996</CitationRef>). Shift workers are also more likely to gain weight and be obese, putting them at risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes (Antunes, Levandovski, Dantas, Caumo, &amp; Hidalgo, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00036">2010</CitationRef>). Furthermore, shift work can have detrimental consequences, for both the worker and the organization. Shift workers report greater levels of stress, including less autonomy and more work conflicts as compared to employees with traditional work schedules (Parkes, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000389">2003</CitationRef>). Likewise, employees with night work schedules commonly report conflict in their personal lives, such that the decreased interactions with spouses and children cause excess stress for family members (Jackson, Zedeck, &amp; Summers, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000353">1985</CitationRef>). In fact, Tepas, Armstron, Carlson, and Duchon (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0003117">1985</CitationRef>) reported that shift workers are 50 % more likely to divorce than workers with traditional schedules.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Research on performance for employees who work nights or rotating shifts has also shown that there is an increase in errors and accidents, particularly during late night and early morning hours (Folkard, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000337">1990</CitationRef>). Factors that contribute to these errors and accidents include not only general sleep deprivation, but also arise from the type of work being done. For example, employees who monitor equipment, such as air traffic controllers and power plant personnel, are more likely to fall asleep on the job as compared to employees whose tasks are more active (Folkard, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000337">1990</CitationRef>). It is through the work of occupational health researchers that these work-place factors are identified and the appropriate interventions are developed, such as alternative schedules and rotating shifts. Effective interventions can reduce the likelihood of injuries and lost productivity for the organization while promoting better health outcomes for the employees.</Para>

                  <Heading>Ergonomics and Occupational Injuries</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Research on ergonomic design within the workplace has identified factors related to physical strain and stress on the employee for which better workplace designs and equipment have been developed. A subset of Occupational Health Psychology, known as Engineering Psychology, focuses on ergonomics and how physical stressors can lead to reduced productivity and the development of serious health conditions. For hundreds of years, ergonomics were never a consideration, as long as workers performing manual labor were easily replaced if injured. Not until the early 1900s was there an interest in the biomechanics in the occupational setting; yet, during this time, productivity, as opposed to human safety, was the main interest. Frederick Winslow Taylor, a mechanical engineer in the late 1800s, helped to transform this point of view from employing “disposable” workers to recognizing how improving working conditions could actually improve productivity (Kanigel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000359">1997</CitationRef>). Taylor’s initiative, termed <Emphasis Type="Italic">industrial efficiency</Emphasis>, put forth recommendations specifically for managers to supervise and organize production processes, to train workers to execute functions more systematically, to allow for routine breaks to avoid excessive fatigue and reduced productivity, and to supply the appropriate equipment necessary for optimal performance. This was the first of its kind to address concerns of biomechanics within the industry setting. This positive contribution was from the same person (Taylor) referenced earlier in the chapter, who also had a negative impact on the field by advocating industrial efficiency at the expense of workers. Thus, his contributions were both positive and negative, with the negative greatly outweighing the positive.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">One of the most noted contributors to biomechanics and ergonomics was Lillian Gilbreth, who further developed a classification system of motions in skilled labor settings. Like F.W. Taylor, Gilbreth studied motions and timing of movements associated with skilled labor. The focus was on improving performance time by changing aspects of certain jobs to limit musculoskeletal stress. Since the 1970s, the view of occupational injuries has changed. In response to the high prevalence rates and escalating costs associated with occupational injuries, workplace interventions geared at ergonomics and employee safety have taken precedence. In many larger corporations, teams of engineers, health and safety experts, and experienced workers are created to develop comprehensive evaluations of workplace ergonomics (Chaffin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000319">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were approximately 4,500 workplace fatalities and approximately 3.3 million nonfatal workplace injuries reported in 2009 (Bureau of Labor and Statistics, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000315">2010</CitationRef>). Occupational health psychologists have conducted extensive research on risk factors for workplace injuries and have designed preventative measures to reduce the likelihood of accidents occurring. Occupational injuries are thought to be caused by several factors, such as physical biomechanics, ergonomics, and psychosocial and cognitive constituents (Boocock et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000312">2007</CitationRef>; Schachter, Busch, &amp; Peloso, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003103">2003</CitationRef>; Waling, Javholm, &amp; Sundelin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003129">2002</CitationRef>). Developing preventions for occupational musculoskeletal injuries can be a difficult task considering individual differences and the influence of psychosocial factors. Many of the factors considered as risk factors for occupational injuries include the type of industry, hours of work, lighting, temperature, equipment design, safety devices, and work pressure. Furthermore, personal factors such as cognitive ability, physiological and psychological fatigue, general health, work experience, job involvement, and job insecurity have been evaluated as contributors to the incidence of accidents in the workplace. Furthermore, occupational health psychologists have also evaluated the extent to which the individuals’ personality characteristics can contribute to workplace injuries (Salminen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003101">2010</CitationRef>; Schultz &amp; Schultz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003105">2010</CitationRef>; Vanroelen, Levecque, Moors, Gadeyne, &amp; Louckx, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003126">2009</CitationRef>; Villanueva &amp; Garcia, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003128">2011</CitationRef>; Wallace &amp; Chen, 2005).</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Occupational health researchers have also identified numerous psychosocial factors that are related to increased stress, which correlate with reduced productivity, increased absenteeism, and greater likelihood of turnover. Many of these factors are related to the job itself, including such issues as role conflict, role ambiguity, supervisor and social support, and perceived equity among colleagues. Other factors are of a personal nature, such as work-life balance and family issues. The following section provides an overview of a few of the commonly assessed psychosocial factors, both work-related and personal, that occupational health researchers have identified as potential stressors for employees.</Para>
                <Section3 ID="Sec000319">
                  <Heading>Job-Related Psychosocial Stressors</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Research has shown that a major contributor to low job satisfaction is job-related stress, and low job satisfaction is directly correlated with poor occupational outcomes, such as increased absenteeism, low organizational commitment, and turnover (Petterson &amp; Arnetz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR003135">1997</CitationRef>). Therefore, by identifying the psychosocial job-related factors that are deemed highly stressful, occupational health psychologists can put forth intervention strategies aimed at training management to recognize and actively work to eliminate common work-place psychosocial stressors.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Work-role demands describe both the formal responsibilities of the job along with the informal responsibilities. Oftentimes, stress occurs when the employee encounters discord within the work-role demands. Role conflict, a leading work-place stressor, describes situations for which the employee is faced with contradicting demands. For example, an employee may be asked to increase productivity while simultaneously cutting resources, or an employee may be given conflicting directives by two different supervisors. Another example of role conflict is when an employee’s job requirements violate his or her own personal ethics. In such situations, employees have a greater likelihood of experiencing stress (Sulsky &amp; Smith, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003113">2005</CitationRef>). Ambiguity is another work-role demand issue that can cause stress. Workers without clear descriptions of their roles often experience role ambiguity. Task ambiguity occurs when an employee is not given the appropriate training or tools to fulfill his or her responsibilities (Sulsky &amp; Smith, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003113">2005</CitationRef>). Furthermore, both work overload, which is described as having too many job demands, and work underload, for which the employee has too few responsibilities, have been linked to occupational stress and poor health outcomes (Dewa, Thompson, &amp; Jacobs, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000328">2011</CitationRef>; Lindfors, Berntsson, &amp; Lundberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000378">2006</CitationRef>; Shultz, Wang, &amp; Olson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003111">2010</CitationRef>). More recently, research has shown how employees who manage others experience high levels of stress. Being responsible for other individuals can create a great amount of stress and anxiety for not only managers but also for teachers, health care workers, law enforcement, etc. (Sulsky &amp; Smith, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003113">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Another workplace factor that has been linked to stress relates to organizational change, which can lead to downsizing and job loss. Research has shown that job insecurity is a major stressor for employees. More recent studies have focused on how organizational survivors, that is, those who did not lose their jobs during a time of organizational change, still exhibit high levels of stress and anxiety. One study showed that employees who had higher levels of control over their work before the layoffs found the reorganization to be more fair as compared to survivors who did not perceive high control (Davy, Kinicki, &amp; Scheck, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000326">1991</CitationRef>). Other researchers have found that employee’s levels of job commitment and job involvement were likely to decrease for survivors of downsizing (Allen, Freeman, Russell, Reizenstein, &amp; Rentz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00032">2001</CitationRef>).</Para>

                  <Heading>External Stress-Related Factors</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Occupational health researchers do not only limit their studies to the workplace itself but also investigate external factors that increase the likelihood of poor occupational outcomes. For example, many studies have shown that females are more likely to report higher levels of stress as compared to males (Schultz &amp; Schultz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003105">2010</CitationRef>). However, in a more thorough investigation, Galanakis, Stalikas, Kallia, Karagianni, and Karela (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000339">2009</CitationRef>) found that when controlling for age, education level and marital status, males and females did not differ on levels of stress. The authors of this study suggest that one reason females tend to report higher levels of stress is because of other mediating factors related to holding multiple roles. Indeed, work-life balance is a factor that has been studied more recently and findings have shown that having poor work–family balance is linked not only to increased stress and poor health but also with reduced work productivity increased absenteeism and general job dissatisfaction (Schultz &amp; Schultz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003105">2010</CitationRef>). In a recent longitudinal study, Kinnunen, Feldt, Mauno, and Rantanen (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000364">2010</CitationRef>) examined the effects of how work influences family conflict and how family influences work conflict. In this study, high family interference in work conflict was shown to have long-term effects, such that there was both a decrease in job satisfaction and an increase in work influence in family conflict. Additionally, crossover effects were also identified, such that when one partner experienced a stress or psychological strain, it was shown to have an effect on the other partner. Another study demonstrated that there is a bidirectional, or reciprocal, effect such that work–family conflict can increase burnout and that burnout can increase work–family conflict (Innstrand, Langballe, Espnes, Falkum, &amp; Aasland, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000352">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Occupational health researchers have focused on factors that lead to burnout. Several factors that have been identified include emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and inefficacy (Maslach, Schaufeli, &amp; Leiter, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000384">2008</CitationRef>), high levels of time pressure, role conflict, role ambiguity and reduced social support (Schultz &amp; Schultz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003105">2010</CitationRef>), and high work–family conflict and low job satisfaction (Thompson, Brough, &amp; Schmidt, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003123">2006</CitationRef>). Burnout affects individuals both physically and psychologically, and has important reciprocal relationships with family roles affecting home and family life (Innstrand et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000352">2008</CitationRef>). It is important to recognize the symptoms of burnout so that both the organization and the individual can take proactive steps to reduce the stressors.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">It is widely recognized that workplace stress not only affects occupational outcomes, such as reduction in productivity, lower job satisfaction, and increased absenteeism and turnover, but workplace stress is also linked to poor health outcomes. Occupational health researchers are interested in not only identifying these stressors and determining the various individual risk factors for experiencing poor consequences because of these stressors, but are also interested in developing prevention and intervention strategies for reducing the occurrence of these stressors. Some of these stressors are specific to the workplace environment. Such examples include the physical characteristics of the workplace, such as noise, lighting, temperature, and even dangerous job demands. Other stressors include factors inherent to the work itself, such as scheduling, leadership, and work-role factors. External stressors, such as work–family balance, can also contribute to poor health and work productivity.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Many organizations offer some type of stress-management program to help employees experiencing stressors that affect both their job and their health. From an organizational perspective, providing opportunities for control, reducing role conflict, ambiguity and overload, along with providing social support are ways that the employer can help their employees reduce the likelihood of being stressed and experiencing the negative physical and psychological effects of stress.</Para>

              <Heading>Theoretical Models of Work Stress</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In addition to understanding the nature of work and work-related stressors, occupational health psychologists work to understand the theoretical underpinnings of perceived stress. From a theoretical perspective, it is imperative to understand why certain situations are perceived as stressors, what types of stressors cause stress (or strain) and, with this knowledge, what recommendations can be made that will help organizations reduce the amounts of perceived stress within their workforce? For example, some of psychosocial stressors mentioned in the previous section of this chapter, such as work-role demands, demand–control conflict, and reduced social support were more thoroughly understood through theoretical models such as <Emphasis Type="Italic">Person-Organization Fit</Emphasis> (Edwards &amp; Cooper, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000332">1990</CitationRef>; Kahn et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000358">1964</CitationRef>; Lofquist &amp; Dawis, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000379">1969</CitationRef>), <Emphasis Type="Italic">Stress-at-Work</Emphasis> (Cooper &amp; Marshall, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000322">1976</CitationRef>; Marshall &amp; Cooper, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000382">1979</CitationRef>), <Emphasis Type="Italic">Demand–Control</Emphasis> (Karasek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000361">1997</CitationRef>), Effort–Reward (Siegrist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003112">1996</CitationRef>), and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Organizational Justice</Emphasis> (Greenberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000345">2004</CitationRef>). Notably, most occupational health-related theories are grounded in one of the most accepted and widely utilized stress models, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Cognitive Appraisal Model</Emphasis> developed by Lazarus and Folkman (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000372">1984</CitationRef>). After a review of the Cognitive Appraisal Model, the following sections will highlight each of these theoretical models with regard to work stress (see Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00031">3.1</InternalRef>).<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00031">

                <Heading>Cognitive Appraisal Model</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The Cognitive Appraisal Model suggests that demands are processed through two separate, but equally important, appraisals. The primary appraisal distinguishes a stimulus as being irrelevant, benign-positive, or stressful. Intuitively, an irrelevant stimulus is determined to be outside of the realm of importance for the appraiser, whereas a benign-positive demand is assumed to benefit the well-being of the individual. Stress appraisals are slightly more complicated as they include appraisals of potential losses, harmful events, threats, or challenges.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In the primary stress appraisal, a demand is considered to be a threat if it is indicative of imminent harm or loss (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000372">1984</CitationRef>). Furthermore, an appraisal of a threat also indicates there is some room for adaptation or preemptive coping to take place in preparation of the looming harm or loss. A challenge appraisal is similar in anticipatory nature; however, a challenge appraisal is more optimistic with regard to implications. Challenges are typically characterized by positive expectations and excitement about the demand outcomes. It is important to note that both challenges and threat appraisals can happen simultaneously and they are not considered to be polar opposites. Once a demand is appraised to be a challenge or threat, the secondary appraisal of an individual’s resources and coping capabilities becomes salient (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000372">1984</CitationRef>). A thorough evaluation of coping capabilities at this stage includes both the expectation that one encompasses the required coping option (i.e., efficacy expectation), and the expectation that it will work to diminish the threat (i.e., outcome expectation, Bandura, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00037">1977</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00038">1982</CitationRef>). After people are given the opportunity to assess the potential impact an event may have, given the extent of the demand and their abilities to overcome it, they respond in a manner indicative of their evaluation (Greenberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000345">2004</CitationRef>). Stress responses are comprised of emotional, biochemical, physiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes aimed at reducing or adapting to a stressful event and its effects (Baum, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000310">1990</CitationRef>). Many researchers have relied upon Lazarus and Folkman’s cognitive appraisal model to explain sources of work-related stress.</Para>

                <Heading>Person–Environment Fit</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Perhaps one of the most salient characteristics of stress involves individuals’ evaluation of their own capabilities (Lazarus &amp; Launier, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000373">1978</CitationRef>; Vermunt &amp; Steensma, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003127">2005</CitationRef>). Often described in terms of person–environment fit, the interaction between an individual’s capabilities with the demands of a situation can lead to perceived stress (Kahn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000357">1970</CitationRef>; Lewin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000377">1938</CitationRef>). The misfit between the demands of the environment and the resources of the individual is typically determined by the individual’s appraisal of his/her own internal and external resources (Lazarus &amp; Launier, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000373">1978</CitationRef>). To the extent there is a discrepancy between a person’s capacities and the demands or challenges of the environment, the situation is deemed a stressor (Kahn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000357">1970</CitationRef>; Lazarus &amp; Launier, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000373">1978</CitationRef>; Lewin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000377">1938</CitationRef>). Researchers and practitioners are more readily evaluating person–environment fit with a contextual framework by considering components such as organizational conditions (e.g., culture, technology, industry), as well as environmental conditions (e.g., legal requirements, labor markets, economy; Russell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003100">2001</CitationRef>; Van Harrison, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003125">1978</CitationRef>). In fact, person–environment fit has been broken down into four distinct fit indices including: person–occupation fit (evaluates industry and vocation; Holland, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000350">1959</CitationRef>), person–group fit (evaluates coworkers and peer groups; Higgins &amp; Sekiguchi, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000348">2006</CitationRef>; Kristof, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000366">1996</CitationRef>), person–job fit (evaluates job demands; Dawis, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000327">1992</CitationRef>; Edwards, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000330">1991</CitationRef>), and person–organization fit (evaluates company climate and values; Kristof, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000366">1996</CitationRef>). Further, some researchers go as far as to use two frameworks to evaluate person–environment fit: the demand-abilities fit and the needs-supply fit (Cable &amp; Judge, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000316">1994</CitationRef>; Kristof, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000366">1996</CitationRef>; Sekiguchi, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003106">2004a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003107">2004b</CitationRef>). Recent research has demonstrated that these multiple dimensions of fit can have independent effects on job satisfaction, commitment, and intention to leave (Edwards &amp; Billsberry, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000331">2010</CitationRef>). Therefore, the multidimensional nature of person–environmental fit should be routinely taken into consideration when examining work-related stress.</Para>

                <Heading>Demand–Control</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The Demand–Control Model, another framework used to describe job stress, points to the amount of decision latitude an employee has, relative to the demands being placed on them in their job role (Karasek &amp; Theorell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000362">1990</CitationRef>). In this model, the term job demands refers to the mental workload, including interpersonal interactions, qualitative demands, and quantitative demands, rather than any physical demands included in the role. Control refers to the ability to influence others in order to reduce threats, which is particularly useful as a coping mechanism in reference to the Cognitive Appraisal Model (Ganster, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000340">1989</CitationRef>; Lazarus &amp; Launier, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000373">1978</CitationRef>). Autonomy, a sub-factor of control, refers to the amount of decision latitude that includes the authority to make decisions about work schedules and methods, and also having the possibility to utilize skills and develop other skills as needed (Connell, Lee, &amp; Spector, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000321">2004</CitationRef>). The additional component of decision latitude to job demands allowed this model to be one of the first to view the risk of psychosocial stressors on nonexecutive populations, particularly the working class (Theorell &amp; Karasek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003122">1996</CitationRef>). Using the Demand–Control Model as a framework, these authors demonstrated that the combination of a highly psychologically demanding job, with low control or decision latitude, is a health risk factor that has been linked to cardiovascular disease (Theorell &amp; Karasek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003122">1996</CitationRef>). Additionally, further research has demonstrated that limited decision latitude (low control) can also be a risk factor for distress in and of itself (Hemingway &amp; Marmot, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000347">1999</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Effort–Reward</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The Effort–Reward Model, proposed by Siegrist (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0003112">1996</CitationRef>), was developed to reflect the stress that is perceived due to an imbalance of high efforts and low rewards. Built upon the premise of equity and reciprocity, societal norms regarding social exchange suggest that efforts should be matched with a fair reward of some type (e.g., money, esteem, status control, etc.). Often referred to as costs (effort) and gains (reward), the Effort–Reward Model posits that an imbalance between these two constructs indicates a lack of reciprocity, which triggers the response of emotional distress.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The Effort–Reward Model was not suggested to replace the Demand–Control Model (Karasek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000360">1979</CitationRef>; Karasek &amp; Theorell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000362">1990</CitationRef>), but it was proposed to explain observed differences that the Demand–Control Model could not. For instance, the Effort–Reward Model introduces the term <Emphasis Type="Italic">status control</Emphasis> to operationalize the need for self-regulation in terms of self-esteem, efficacy, and sense of mastery or accomplishment (Siegrist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003112">1996</CitationRef>). As Siegrist explains, occupational position serves as a social role for most people; therefore, a threat to that role would likely produce emotional distress. In that sense, any indication of job insecurity would indicate low status control.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The Effort–Reward Model differs from the Demand–Control Model in that the costs of adapting to a lack of control that is task-related is less than the costs of adapting to a lack of status control (Siegrist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003112">1996</CitationRef>). As such, Siegrist argues that, particularly due to the changing nature of work through globalization and technology, concerns about status control (i.e., threats of job termination or lack of promotional opportunities) may override low task-related control, particularly if high efforts are exerted.</Para>

                <Heading>Organizational Justice</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Organizational justice, one of the most widely studied areas with regard to job-related stress, is still relatively new. Despite its novelty in the field, there is sufficient evidence that is indicative of the consistent and compelling dynamic between injustice and stress (Greenberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000346">2010</CitationRef>). Justice was first conceived by Adams (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00031">1965</CitationRef>) who investigated negative responses (i.e., psychological distress) to inequitable rewards (i.e., perceived unfair decisions). In his study, Adams measured the psychological distress in terms of behavioral reactions, such as a reduction in effort, rationalizing that the participant reduced the inputs to balance out the effort to output ratio. Outcome fairness, appropriately labeled distributive justice, was expanded to include allocation rules such as equity and need (Leventhal, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000374">1976</CitationRef>). In 1980, Leventhal introduced the importance of procedural justice, described as the fairness of the procedures that determine outcomes (Leventhal, Karuza, &amp; Fry, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000375">1980</CitationRef>). Almost a decade later, a third justice variable was introduced by Bies and Moag (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000311">1986</CitationRef>). They coined the term <Emphasis Type="Italic">interactional justice</Emphasis> and defined it as the interpersonal treatment people receive in organizations, qualified by the distributive and procedural justice within the organization. Recently, interactional justice has separated into two further dimensions labeled <Emphasis Type="Italic">interpersonal justice</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">informational justice</Emphasis>. Interpersonal justice refers to the interactional factors related to distributive justice, whereas informational justice encompasses the interactional factors related to procedural justice (Colquitt, Conlon, Wesson, Porter, &amp; Ng, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000320">2001</CitationRef>; Greenberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000344">1993</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Firmly grounded within the Cognitive Appraisal Model, Greenberg (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000345">2004</CitationRef>) proposed a theory entitled the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Justice Salience Hierarchy</Emphasis> (JSH), in which the organizational justice variables act as the events for which the cognitive appraisals of harm/loss, threat, or challenge occur. Greenberg suggested that people evaluate their outcomes (i.e., distributive justice) through their fairness appraisals of the processes that designate those outcomes (i.e., procedural justice). Studies depicting this interaction reported lower levels of stress, exhaustion, anxiety, and depression in those that experienced negative outcomes followed by fair procedures than those that the negative outcomes were followed by unfair procedures (e.g., Janssen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000355">2004</CitationRef>; Tepper, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003118">2000</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003119">2001</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The secondary appraisal within the JSH then points to the moderating effects of interactional justice (Greenberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000345">2004</CitationRef>). In his theoretical paper, Greenberg suggested that the interpersonal nature of this third justice variable could either increase or diminish the perceived stress, thus resulting in an interaction. In totality, the JSH proposes that an outcome (i.e., distributive justice) is first evaluated as a threat to the extent that the procedures determining the outcome (i.e., procedural justice) are unfair and secondly assessed to the extent that the interpersonal treatment surrounding the event (i.e., interactional justice) is unjust (Greenberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000345">2004</CitationRef>). To our knowledge, the only study to directly test both the primary and secondary appraisal levels of the JSH was conducted on a cross-sectional sample of working college students (Graham, Lopez, &amp; Dougall, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000343">2008</CitationRef>). In their study, informational justice, a component of interactional justice moderated the negative relationships of both the distributive and procedural justice and stress. The negative associations increased when informational injustice was present; however, it was less intense when participants perceived informational justice from their supervisors.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Adverse psychosocial stressors can be as serious as other health risks; however, they are also the least understood, likely due to their hidden and indirect nature (Everson-Rose &amp; Lewis, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000336">2004</CitationRef>). In that regard, it is important that both organizations and researchers investigate the depth of this relationship for both humanitarian and economic reasons. In other words, organizations should strive to reduce the levels of perceived stress among their workforce simply because they care about their employees, but also to realize the economic returns of stress reduction through fewer counter-productive behaviors, lower rates of absenteeism, and increased commitment and productivity. In fact, studies have reported that workers with high stress levels were over two times more likely to be absent 5 or more days a year (Jacobson, Aldana, Goetzel, &amp; Vardell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000354">1996</CitationRef>). Job stress is responsible for an estimated cost of $10,000 per worker, which translates to $300 billion for the US economy. For our nation’s top executives, outcomes linked directly to stress such as absence, illness, and early death, account for an estimated $10–20 billion annually (AIS, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00033">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Preventative stress management, one of the leading models of stress management within the business world, may be helpful if applied through an organizational justice framework. Preventative stress management purports that, if job stress is truly an epidemic, then prevention is the best policy for addressing the issue at hand (Elkin &amp; Rosch, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000333">1990</CitationRef>; Quick, Quick, Nelson, &amp; Hurrell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000393">1997</CitationRef>). The guiding principle behind preventative stress management involves interpreting the public health notions of prevention through an organizational framework (Quick, Quick, &amp; Nelson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000392">1998</CitationRef>). Within the preventative stress management framework, there are three key points of intervention, intuitively labeled the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, respectively (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00031">3.1</InternalRef>; Quick, Cooper, Nelson, Quick, &amp; Gavin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000390">2003</CitationRef>).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00031">

              <Para TextBreak="No">Primary prevention targets the front-line demands of the work environment to ensure that work demands are manageable for the employee. At this level, the goal is to address the cause of the problem before it becomes an issue. At this level of intervention, public health training, promotions, and campaigns are deployed in organizations for the entire population, regardless of those at risk or not (Tetrick &amp; Quick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003120">2003</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The secondary level of prevention targets those that are suspected of being at risk of heightened stress. This level of intervention focuses more on managing the individual’s responses to the demands placed on them (Quick &amp; Quick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000391">1997</CitationRef>; Quick, Simmons, &amp; Nelson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000394">2000</CitationRef>). At this level, the demands are held constant, but the intervention comes about in helping individuals’ cope with and manages the stress they may feel. Typically, this level includes stress reduction techniques that help employees manage their potentially adverse reactions prior to the escalation of the stress response. Likewise, this level of prevention can also be conducted with either groups or individuals.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The final, tertiary level of prevention targets individuals who have shown signs of degenerative health due to stress (Quick et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000390">2003</CitationRef>). This level of intervention is primarily therapeutic through either a psychosocial or medicinal approach. Notably, the primary and secondary levels of prevention fit well within occupational health psychology as they are best approached from a multidisciplinary framework; however, the tertiary level of prevention is often delegated to clinical, counseling, or rehabilitative psychology (Tetrick &amp; Quick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003120">2003</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Occupational health psychology has made great strides in the past 100 years. Employees are no longer perceived as emotionless, mechanistic workers whose sole purpose is to increase organizational productivity. The field now acknowledges that productivity is most effectively maximized by enabling happy and healthy workers. The focus is now on increasing both worker and organizational health in today’s changing work environments. Many researchers and organizational health psychology organizations across the World have identified important risk and resilience factors for predicting employees’ physical, mental, and social well-being. Most of these factors can be linked to the experience of stress in the work place. Theories of work-related stress have emerged that help to conceptualize the process and suggest targets for interventions aimed at reducing stress and its adverse health effects. The field of occupational health psychology has made amazing contributions to occupational health, but it is still growing. It will be exciting to see what new developments occur in the next 100 years as the nature of work continues to change with continued advancements in technology and globalization.</Para>

              <Heading>Future Directions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Research in occupational health psychology has led to improvements in most employees’ work conditions. However, there is limited dissemination of many effective occupational health interventions, including stress management. Some countries like Sweden and those in the European Union have or are developing legislation to promote employee participation in decisions related to their jobs and performance. In the USA, NIOSH makes similar recommendations, but there are no laws in place. Public health policy changes aimed at creating legislation can be further supported with continued research by occupational health psychologists. Additionally, even when employees have access to interventions, they may not follow the appropriate procedures, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of the interventions or eschewing the intervention efforts altogether. For example, many employees in the USA work in environments with hazardous noise exposure, yet some employees do not wear the personal protective equipment that is provided to prevent hearing loss (Tak, Davis, &amp; Calvert, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0003115">2009</CitationRef>). Clearly, research efforts need to focus on teaching organizations about the effectiveness of existing occupational health programs and creating feasible interventions that can be easily disseminated, possibly through the creation of wellness centers and programs. After organizations adopt appropriate interventions, organizational health psychologists need to devise ways to educate employees and increase their use of such interventions.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Additionally, new priority areas in occupational health are regularly identified by national organizations. In the USA, the National Occupational Research Agenda was developed in 1996 to identify high priority research needs and to help provide a research framework for occupational health (Rosenstock, Olenec, &amp; Wagner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000399">1998</CitationRef>). These research priorities vary by the type of workforce sector, acknowledging the complexity and uniqueness of each type of job and the person–environment fit. Organizational health psychology teams are perfect for addressing these high priority needs. They bring interdisciplinary perspectives from a rich history of research that inspires innovative research designs to develop creative solutions.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Given the nature of the ever-changing work environment, new concerns and needs will continue to arise in occupational health, as well as those current needs that researchers are only beginning to understand. Some of these emerging needs are discussed in later chapters of this handbook and include work-place bullying (<ExternalRef>
