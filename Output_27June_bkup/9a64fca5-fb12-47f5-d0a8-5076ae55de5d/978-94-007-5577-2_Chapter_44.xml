              <Para>The US National Air Quality Forecasting Capability (NAQFC) is aiming at providing quantitative forecast for particulate matters (PM) smaller than 2.5 μm diameter in a few years. The highly variable spatial and temporal distribution of PM together with its numerous combination of chemical composition, mixing states, coatings of organics, and characteristics of origination pose challenges to predict its mass, speciation, and distribution over space and time. An equally considerable challenge is the potential strengthening of the US EPA ozone standards. This will make background concentration of ozone a more relevant topic. Furthermore, there is evidence that long range transport is causing the background concentrations to increase in recent decades. Capturing real-time concentrations of the various constituents in the inflowing air-mass to the Conterminous US (CONUS) domain is important. It was reported that PM emitted during large fires can stay in the atmosphere for multiple days. Therefore PM25 forecasting should include the best real-time emission information on intra- and- extra-domain wild fires. By the same token the wild fire information helps ozone forecasting. In this study we address the real-time emission capturing of intra- and exo-domain wild fires. Wild fires is a major originator and precursor emitter of PM and ozone. A large North America parent domain is setup to facilitate the generation of dynamic boundary condition for a nested CONUS domain. A Blue-skies framework-based Hazard Mapping System (HMS) is used to ingest near real-time wild fire information within the parent as well as the CONUS domains. Result of this nested run will be compared to that without nesting to delineate its impact. Both ground-based and airborne measurement will be used to quantify the fidelity of the forecast for July 2011, where there were numerous fires in North America both within and without the CONUS.</Para>

              <Heading>Methodology and July 2011 Case</Heading>
              <Para>To incorporate real-time wild fire sources into an Air Quality (AQ) forecasting modeling prototype for NAQFC, a β-version of it [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00446">6</CitationRef>] is used to facilitate the study. NAQFC is an off-line system consists of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Non-hydrostatic Meso-scale Model with Arakawa B-grid staggering (NMMB) coupled with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00445">5</CitationRef>]. The former provides meteorological data feed to the latter, a chemical transport model accounting for projected emission, transformation, transport, and removal of atmospheric chemical constituents owing to physical and chemical processes. To validate the methods used in this β version, the July 2011 period is chosen for sensitive studies. The (DISCOVER-AQ) campaign with space, air-borne and ground based coordinated measurements was conducted in the period over the Baltimore and Washington area [<CitationRef CitationID="CR0044101">2</CitationRef>]. Selected data from the campaign is utilized to quantify the attributions of the wild-fire emissions.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00443">
                <Heading>Operational NAQFC</Heading>
                <Para>In concert with accurate description of the meteorology and processes stated by the governing equation of NMMB [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00443">4</CitationRef>] and CMAQ [<CitationRef CitationID="CR0044102">1</CitationRef>], NAQFC uses the following procedures to project emission: (1) Point sources: The US EPA 2005 National Emission Inventory (NEI) is used as the base data for Electric Generation Unit (EGU) and non-EGU point emission rates and initial thermal characteristics. The EGU emission rates for NOx and SO2 were calculated by multiplying the measured 2009 point source fluxes from Continuous Emission Monitoring (CEM) with the ratio of US Department of Energy Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) for 2011 and 2009. Across the Northern and Southern borders, the province-level 2000 Canadian, and the 1999 Mexican national inventories were used, respectively; (2) Area and off-road vehicular sources: The same national inventories as used in by point source were used. The data were processed through the Sparse Matrix (SMOKE) system to obtain spatial and temporal specifications. Climatology wild fire, agricultural prescribed burns have been removed; (3) Biogenic sources: An online version of (BEIS) version 3.10 was employed to generate biogenic reactive (VOC) modulated by meteorological parameters such as 2 m temperature and moisture; and (4) Mobile sources: The aforementioned national inventories were again the base data. The (OTAQ) 2005 on-road emission inventory is used to generate on-road mobile emissions over the U.S. The data were processed through (MOBILE) version 6 system to obtain spatial and temporal specifications.</Para>

                <Para>Ingestion of near real-time wild fire emissions was carried out in two steps: (A) Fires within the so-called NAQFC Conterminous US (CONUS) domain (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00441">44.1</InternalRef>) – dubbed as intra-domain fire emission, was derived through a real-time wild fire detection/quantification product by (NESDIS). It is based on HMS which integrates satellite-retrieval fire-counts and the Blue Skies framework of quantifying variable burn-rates utilizing vegetation fuel-type, loading and moisture inventories. This information was fed into a fire-specific modified SMOKE system to obtain plume-rise and speciation information as additional 3-dimensional pollutant injections. Modifications included speciation mapping based on mass-scaling using CO [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00442">3</CitationRef>] and plume rise treatments as additional point sources of buoyant plumes. And (B), for fires outside the CONUS but within the NMMB-North American Model (NAM) (HYSPLIT) domain (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00441">44.1</InternalRef>) – dubbed the exo-domain fire emissions to the NAQFC CONUS domain, was used to perform a simultaneous wild-fire specific HYSPLIT model run to Step (A). HYSPLIT – a Lagrangian dispersion model, predicts the dispersion of CO as a trace gas. Identical speciation mapping and plume rise treatments used in step (A) was used. However, the fire hot-spots identified as intra-domain emission sources are removed from the fire-specific HYSPLIT run so as not to double-count those fires already accounted for by the SMOKE system in step (A). Hourly concentration of CO forecasted in the NAM domain by HYSPLIT along the lateral boundaries of the NAQFC CONUS domain is extracted, species-mapped and merged with other chemical constituents of the otherwise static Boundary Condition (BC) to be fed into the β-NAQFC forecast as dynamic BC’s. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00441">

              <Para>This study concentrates on the Baltimore and Washington (BW) area to take advantage the many collocated ground and air-borne data obtained by the DISCOVER-AQ campaign. During the campaign month of July 2011, the HMS system detected fires near the BW areas on July 2, 5, 10, 20, and 27. All these days there were flight measurement and (AIRNow) data. The study further selected the 20th data as the prime set for model sensitivity study as it has the longest hours of flight data.

              <Para>Real time intra- and exo-domain wild fire emissions are included in a β version of the US National Air Quality Forecasting Capability (NAQFC). Three sensitivity runs were performed with this β version: (1) base-run with no wild fire, (2) with intra domain fire, and (3) with both intra- and exo-domain wild fires. The period of July 2011 was chosen since an intensive measurement campaign was carried out in the Baltimore and Washington area that month. Selected land, aircraft and satellite-based measurement have been employed to verify run results of the sensitivity runs. There was slight exacerbation of over bias for O<Subscript>3</Subscript> for cases (2) and (3), but considerable reduction of under-bias of PM25 for the two cases especially for case (3). There were sizable uncertainties involved in the mass flux quantification of the pertinent emission species. These results are preliminary.</Para>
