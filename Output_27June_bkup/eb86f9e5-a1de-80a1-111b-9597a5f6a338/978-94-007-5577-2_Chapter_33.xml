              <Para>Air quality managers have traditionally relied on deterministic and statistical approaches for forecasting concentrations. In some parts of the world, concentration forecasts are used to trigger urgent and sometimes drastic preventative measures in the hope that severe pollution episodes are alleviated or avoided altogether. These preventative measures, however, are often applied rather indiscriminately to all emission sources without accounting for specific influence of each individual source on the forecast outcome. This blanket approach fails to improve air quality in a cost-effective manner. Adjoint sensitivity analysis approach provides a unique framework for efficient forecast of the impact of individual sources on short-term air quality. We demonstrate how this method can be used for short-term emission behavior modification resulting in amelioration of pollution episodes.</Para>

              <Para>Over 400 urban areas host populations in excess of one million worldwide. With these large urban areas comes harmful air pollution that is estimated to result in 4.1 million deaths annually [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00331">1</CitationRef>]. While many governments have set in place policies to reduce hazardous air pollution, these policies generally aim to improve the air quality over the long term. This long-term strategic planning has proven to be effective in many regions of world. However, there is a great deal of day-to-day variability in pollution influences on a specific receptor. These potentially significant differences in spatial distribution of contributions imply that any long-term policy, as effective as it can be on average, would have significantly varying success rate on different days. Few jurisdictions, however, have employed policies to address short-term emergency episodes in near future, and the few that do, have typically employed heavy-handed blanket approaches. For instance, Onursal and Gautam [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00332">2</CitationRef>] describe one such policy in Mexico City where a 2 day ban on up to 40 % of vehicles in Mexico City prohibited driving on days where air pollution exceeded certain levels. This policy proved to be so unpopular that it was almost never enacted.</Para>
              <Para>Prediction of concentrations has been attempted for many years through the use of statistical or deterministic models. Concentration forecasts provide prior knowledge about pollution episodes but cannot guide short-term management efforts in an effective manner. For over a decade air quality models have been extended to include the capability to calculate sensitivities alongside concentrations. One particularly promising area has been the development of backward or adjoint sensitivity tools. Adjoint sensitivity analysis allows for calculation of contributions from individual sources to a scalar metric such as concentration at a location.</Para>
              <Para>In this work, we introduce an efficient approach for Adaptive Air Quality Management (AAQM). The proposed framework is based on identification of major contributing sources to a future pollution episode by forecasting adjoint (backward) sensitivities. In so doing, air quality decision makers may adapt to the unique conditions of an oncoming adverse air quality episode and manage emission sources in near optimal way to alleviate the negative impacts.</Para>

              <Para>Adjoint sensitivity analysis requires the definition of an adjoint cost function, i.e., the scalar the sensitivity of which is being calculated. We consider ozone concentration at a specific receptor (Baltimore) and the Canadian Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00333">3</CitationRef>] in Toronto as the adjoint cost functions. Sensitivities in this work are calculated using the adjoint of the gas-phase processes in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00334">4</CitationRef>]. Adjoint sensitivities are calculated using a coarse 36 km domain over the continental US for sample days with poor air quality in the summer of 2007. For the first case, the ozone concentration in Baltimore is used as the cost function. As an example of an alternative concentration-based metric, the AQHI in Toronto is taken as the cost function. We use a simplified first-order approximation of the AQHI (based on a Taylor series expansion of the original form): <Equation ID="Equ00331">

              </Para>
              <Para>We apply three emission behavior modification scenarios for major point source emitters and mobile sources affecting the adjoint cost function. As the air quality authority (e.g., a municipality) is unlikely to be able to shut down a large percentage of sectors, we assume that emission behavior modifications are 5, 10, and 15 % for point sources, and 8, 15, and 25 % for mobile sources, under the three considered scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, we consider two separate cases for daily and hourly contribution estimation from individual sources. For the daily case, emission behavior modification at the levels mentioned above is applied to sources in the top 10 % contributing cells. In the case of hourly contribution calculations, only the top 5 % grid-hour contributing sources undergo prescribed emission reductions in each scenario.</Para>

              <Para>We aim to examine whether targeted emission modifications at these levels can trigger sizeable change in predicted concentrations. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig00331">33.1</InternalRef>a shows the results for the least aggressive scenario for the Baltimore case where improvement as a result of emission modification is plotted against the initial 8-h maximum concentrations for a number of days in summer of 2007. Any value above the x-axis in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00331">33.1</InternalRef> indicates an improvement and the straight lines present the required improvement for reaching the current maximum 8-h standard (75 ppb) or the previously recommended lower level (65 ppb). While sizeable improvement is made, the shift is not sufficient to attain standards. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig00331">33.1</InternalRef>b depicts the results for the same exercise but for AQHI management in Toronto and under the most aggressive emission behavior modification scenario. Improvements achieved in AQHI are more significant as the emission modification in this scenario is more aggressive. Furthermore, AQHI includes NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> for which local controls are more effective. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00331">

              <Para>The simulations shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00331">33.1</InternalRef> are performed over a coarse grid and modest emission modification scenarios. More aggressive emission modification scenarios result in more sizeable improvements in predicted episodes. Also, higher resolution simulations would provide the opportunity to better delineate contributions and perform targeted emission modifications.</Para>
              <Para>The success of an AAQM system will depend on effective recruitment of emitters for participation in the program, which may require consideration of various forms of incentives as well as public education. One particularly important challenge lies in the evaluation of the performance of the AAQM system. Since forecast sensitivities cannot be observed, a thorough evaluation of the AAQM’s success is often impossible except for cases that involve long-term trend analysis. In other words, once an emission intervention is implemented, one would never know for certain how the air quality would have been without the intervention. This limitation further emphasizes the need for more thorough investigation of this approach.</Para>

              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A:</Emphasis> Inclusion of NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> in the Canadian health index is due to an observed association between NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> and health outcomes (i.e., mortality) in Canadian time series studies. Health Canada maintains that this association is not explained by other species, and therefore, that inclusion of NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> is not only justified but also necessary. They agree, however, that the observed association does not imply causality and that NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> may be a proxy for some other pollutants. This lack of causality implies that reductions in NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions may not result in reduction in the associated health outcomes. Therefore, there are good arguments for and against inclusion of NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> in policy-relevant air quality metrics.</SimplePara>
