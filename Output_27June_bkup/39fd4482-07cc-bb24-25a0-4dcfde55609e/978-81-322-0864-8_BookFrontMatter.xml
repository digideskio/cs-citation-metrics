              The present textbook entitled
              <Emphasis Type="Italic">Biological Monitoring of Water and Waste Water</Emphasis>
              is an appreciable attempt made by Dr. Anju Agrawal, Associate Professor, and Dr. Krishna Gopal, Senior Principal Scientist. In fact, books written by Indian authors on Biological Monitoring and Waste Water are scanty. The books written by foreign writers are either not easily understood by Indian students or not accessible in market. Therefore, in the present national context such an attempt by two professionals are commendable.
            </Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Biological monitoring of water quality could be useful for assessing the overall health of water bodies followed by safe supply of drinking water. The chemical nature of toxicants is highly dynamic in the environment with time and space, whereas biological systems can integrate all environmental viables over a large period of time in terms of effect, which can be easily measured and quantified. In view of the above, there is pressing need to determine the biological quality of natural resources as well as drinking water based on standard protocols and guidelines provided by regulatory agencies.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">
              This book fulfils the pressing need today in monitoring the biological responses of the species and communities, which are sheltering under the stress of abiotic and biotic alterations taking place inside the ecosystem. Apart from that, parameters selected within the chapters also cater to the needs of policy makers and authorities assessing for granting environmental clearances. In my opinion, the effort made by Dr. Agrawal and Dr. Gopal is praiseworthy. This book shall find a niche in the libraries and information centres of Indian universities and research institutes as well. I am sure the readers will like reading this book.

            <Para TextBreak="No">Biological monitoring of water quality could be useful for assessing the overall health of water bodies and safe supply of drinking water. The chemical nature of toxicant is highly dynamic in environment with time and space, whereas biological system can integrate all environmental variables over a large period of time in terms of effect which can be easily measured and quantified. In view of the above, there is pressing need to determine the water quality of natural resources as well as drinking water based on the standard protocols and guidelines from regulatory agencies.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">It is clear that the synthetic chemicals are essential for our society to maintain the health and well-being of the people. However, there has been a range of detrimental effects on human health and natural environment. In general, we need to improve our management of waste chemicals discharged into the air, water and soil environments. New techniques are needed to predict adverse effects before they occur and for the treatment of wastes. In addition, a range of social, political and economic factors will be needed to be taken into account in order to achieve success.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The improper disposal of wastes causes contamination of both soil and water, which could lead to adverse effects on human health. Migration of chemicals through ground and surface water increases contaminants in drinking water sources. While giving the categories of hazardous wastes, there regulatory quantities and hazard potential in different types such as industrial, domestic, agricultural, nuclear, hospital, biochemical and pharmaceutical wastes.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Every known substance has the potential to be toxic, while a potent toxin could be useful to human health. Several biotoxins can be used as medicines and also as pharmacological tools because of their specificities. Biotoxins are produced by wide range of organisms for their own defence and offence. They can severely affect or kill other living organisms. They can enter the body through ingestion of food and water or by air through aerosols. Marine biotoxins are important since they are most potent and many of them get biomagnified and become part of food chain.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Heavy metals and other chemicals commonly found above the prescribed permissible limits and microbial agents have been found in drinking water. Disinfection is the most important step in the treatment of water for public supply for destruction of pathogens. It involves the use of a reactive chemical agent such as chlorine, which is not only bactericidal but in excess amounts is also capable of reacting with other water constituents to form new compounds with harmful long-term effects of human health. There is a need for the development of a natural disinfectant with no possible long-term harmful effects. Conclusively, it is clear that most of the xenobiotics and toxins can be determined using sophisticated instruments. However, mechanical devices and proper particles are only tools to record the biological monitoring of a natural ecosystem.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Over and above, these chapters have been selected keeping in view of the syllabus of the Indian Universities and guidelines of institutions. There is pressing need today to monitor the biological responses of the species and communities which are sheltering under the stress of abiotic and biotic alterations undergoing inside the ecosystem. Parameters selected within the chapters are also catering the needs of policymakers and authorities assessing for granting environmental clearance. We authors will be happy to know the suggestions from the readers and other stake holders. The authors are sure that this book will be very useful to students and scientific community as a whole.
