              <Para>The Town Energy Balance (TEB) single-layer scheme is implemented into a numerical weather prediction model running operationally at ∼4 km resolution. The primary question addressed is the potential use of TEB, at this relatively coarse resolution, in an operational configuration to improve sensible weather performance over Belgium. Simulations with and without TEB are first evaluated against 2 m observations and wind above the urban canopy for 2 months (January and July 2010). The 2 m temperature and 2 m relative humidity improve compared to measurements in urban areas. The comparison of wind speed and wind direction above the urban canopy indicate that the structure of the flow in urban areas is better reproduced with TEB. Results from a 36-h case study during a high heat day (8 July 2010) indicate that even at this coarse resolution, TEB is able to reproduce correctly the intensity of the observed UHI of Brussels.</Para>

              <Para>At the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (RMIB), our framework ALARO-0 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR01121">1</CitationRef>] is a version of the Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle-Aire Limitée Adaptation Dynamique Développement International (ARPEGE-ALADIN) operational limited area model with a revised and modular structure of the physical parameterizations. This new version currently allows for the production of consistent and realistic results at resolutions ranging from a few tens of kilometers down to less than 4 km. A version of ∼4 km resolution is operationally used at the RMIB since 2009. However, running ALARO at this high resolution results in more grid points that will represent urban areas for 100 % (see Fig. 1 in Hamdi et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR01122">2</CitationRef>]). In the last few years, several efforts have been made in order to improve the representation of urban surface characteristics with varying levels of sophistication from relatively simplistic bulk approaches to the most sophisticated multi-layer schemes. However, the vast majority of work done with these urban parameterizations has been research oriented with very high resolution runs (1 km or less) for specific urban case studies. Therefore, this study was motivated by the desire to evaluate the performance of the Town Energy Balance (TEB, [<CitationRef CitationID="CR01123">3</CitationRef>]) single-layer module within the ALARO 4 km resolution in an operational configuration. For this effort, simulations with and without TEB are evaluated over Belgium which is one of the most densely populated countries within Europe with some 330 inhabitants per km<Superscript>2</Superscript>. Note that the additional resources needed to run ALARO with TEB for our operational domain using the computing resources available at our institute is rather low, the time needed to complete a 36 h forecast is on the order of 0.6 % and the memory increase is about 1.6 %.</Para>

              <Para>For 2 months (January 2010 and July 2010), a series of simulations is performed, with (ALR-TEB) and without TEB (ALR-OPR), with one simulation of 36 h each day, starting at 0000 UTC (from the operational ALADIN French forecast model analysis).</Para>

                <Para>This figure presents the scores obtained for the Uccle station which is situated some 6 km South of the center of Brussels in a suburban area (50.80 N, 04.35 E). During nighttime (which is longer in January than in July), 2 m temperatures are generally cold for both simulations, with and without TEB, compared to observations. However, the average mean bias for Uccle is significantly reduced when using TEB, with an average of −1.39 K for ALR-OPR versus −0.76 K for ALR-TEB during winter and an average of −0.70 K for ALR-OPR versus −0.13 K for ALR-TEB during the summer. Because of radiation trapping effects in street canyon and impermeable surfaces that convert incoming radiation to sensible heat and store it more efficiently than the surrounding rural area, the surface layer in a city is generally warmer than that of its surroundings. This leads to the formation of the so-called urban, heat island (UHI). The effect in ALR-TEB can be attributed to these mechanisms which are not handled with the operational version of ALARO. During daytime, ALR-TEB has a tendency to produce higher maximum temperature especially during the summer. The temperature results correlate with the 2 m relative humidity results (not shown).</Para>

              <Heading>Model Simulation for a Hot Summer Day (8 July 2010)</Heading>
              <Para>The two model simulations are examined in greater detail for the 36-h time period from 0000 UTC 8 July 2010. On this day, an anticyclone covers Belgium and near-record high temperature was observed. The strength of the UHI of Brussels is estimated using the temperature observed at Uccle and at the rural climatological station Brussegem situated in the Northwest, 20 km distant from the centre of Brussels (see Fig. 17 in Hamdi et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR01122">2</CitationRef>]). During the day the UHI reaches its maximum of 1.33 °C at noon which is in agreement with the observed difference in the maximum temperature for this day between Uccle and Brussegem (1.3 °C). This indicates that even at this coarse resolution (∼4 km) ALR-TEB is able to reproduce correctly the intensity of the observed UHI of Brussels. In the afternoon, the cooling process begins with the decrease of solar radiation, including a decrease of the UHI to only 1 °C. However at 1800 UTC, a sudden and strong temperature increase of the heat island intensity is obvious. Within two hours the UHI intensity reaches about 4.5 °C which is in agreement with the observed difference in the minimum temperature for this day between Uccle and Brussegem (4.2 °C).</Para>
