              <Para TextBreak="No">Throughout this past century, numerous high-profile workplace disasters occurred, some of which are listed in Table 13.1. These do not include some of the large energy industry disasters that caused long-term environmental damages, such as: the sinking of the Amoco Cadiz oil tanker off the coast of France in 1978, which was the largest oil spill of its kind in history; the partial-meltdown of the Three Mile Island nuclear energy plant in 1979; the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in 1986; the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill of 1989 in Alaska; and the recent Fukushima I nuclear plant disaster in 2011. Thus, many workplace accidents take a great human toll, as well as an environmental toll. In terms of the human toll part of the equation, as noted by Smith and Carayon (2011), even though the rates of workplace injuries and deaths in the United States have been declining ever since the Bureau of Labor Statistics first began to collect such data in 1972, the sheer numbers remain quite high, and they highlight the fact that improvements in workplace safety and illness are still needed. For example, the 2010 Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed an incidence rate of 3.5 cases per 100 workers per year for nonfatal occupational injury and illness, as well as a total of 4,547 fatal workplace injuries. Moreover, in 2007, 5,488 US workers died from workplace injuries. In that same year, an estimated 49,000 deaths were attributed to work-related diseases. In addition, it was estimated that four million workers had nonfatal work-related injury or illnesses, and about half of those required a job transfer, restricted work, or time away from their jobs. In 2004, approximately 3.4 million workers received treatment at hospital emergency departments because of a work-related injury, and about 80,000 were hospitalized (CDC/NIOSH, 2004a).</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Numerous empirical studies have also documented that worker occupational injuries and illness reported in government sources are grossly undercounted. Many workers, employers, and physicians fail to recognize occupational illnesses as being related to work activities. During 1988–1994, Michigan’s 30,000 physicians were required by law to report occupational injuries. Only 0.7% did so. Most had never seen the occupational disease form. Most of the 115 US medical schools provide little or no training in occupational illness. The 68% that do so report a total of only 6 hours of instruction devoted to the topic over the 4-year program. It should also be noted that companies often conceal worker injury and illnesses to prevent increases in Workers’ Compensation insurance premiums, as well as to avoid Occupational Safety and Health Act (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001357">OSHA</CitationRef>) investigations. A Bureau of Labor 1987 study of 200 randomly selected manufacturing companies, with 10 or more employees, found that total worker illnesses and injuries were underreported by 10%, and lost workdays related to these events by 25%. The large majority of work-related injuries and illnesses by low-wage temporary or contingent workers are grossly undercounted for multiple reasons, including the fact that these workers needed of a daily wage to survive, fear of being fired and unable to find another job. The absence of a comprehensive occupational health data collection system in the United States has resulted in a patchwork array of systems not designed for injury surveillance (Azaroff, Levenstein, &amp; Wegman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00131">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">This Chapter examines causes of workplace nonfatal and fatal injuries, as well as concomitant efforts toward their prevention. Moreover, the increase in “outsourcing” of work by many companies has created a new class of temporary or contingent workers, who now have unique issues and much higher rates of occupational injuries, relative to full-time long-term traditional workers.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">At the outset, it should be noted that, because of the aforementioned statistics on workplace injuries and deaths, the US Congress in 1891 passed the first federal statue for regulating mine safety, including ventilation requirements to remove <Emphasis Type="Italic">methane</Emphasis> and prevent explosions, and prohibiting operators from employing workers less than 12 years of age. In 1910, after a decade in which coal mine fatalities exceeded 2,000 annually, Congress established the Bureau of Mines to conduct mine production and safety research, but with no authority to conduct mine safety inspections until 1941. The first code of federal regulations for mining was authorized by congress in 1947. Congress enacted The Federal Coal Mine Safety Act in 1952, and updated versions of the Act in 1966, 1969, and 1977. Major coal mine disasters were the impetus for each round of congressional legislative action that resulted in increased access for mine safety inspectors, fines and penalties for mine operators’ noncompliance, and withdrawal orders that inspectors could use to close down unsafe mines. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00132">13.2</InternalRef> lists the disasters and death tolls that prompted present day mine safety regulations and their enforcement (Kowalski-Trakofler, Alexander, Brnich, McWilliams, &amp; Reissman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001343">2009</CitationRef>; Kowalski-Trakofler, Alexander, Brnich, &amp; Williams, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001344">2009</CitationRef>).<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00132">

              <Para TextBreak="No">Four points need to be understood about the 11,606 mine deaths listed in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00132">13.2</InternalRef>. First, many of the miner deaths in the early 1900s were immigrants or second-generation descendants of immigrants. Second, these deaths are only those that resulted in five or more miners dying as the result of a single event, like a mine fire or explosion (events that are classified as disasters). Third, most miners during this historical period, as well as at the present time, do not die in disaster events. Rather, they die individually as the results of a wide array of injury events that are historically referred to as mining accidents. Fourth, the total number of coal mine disaster deaths reported in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00132">13.2</InternalRef> is a small fraction of total coal miner deaths during this period. This same principle applies to other workers. Construction workers and fire fighters occasionally die in groups of five or more individuals. However, these isolated disaster events account for only a small fraction of all these deaths. For example, in the United States, an average of five individual construction workers die each day in different isolated events as the result of a wide range of workplace hazards. Farmers and ranchers have occupational death rates of 32.4 per 100,000 workers per year, a rate that is 8.8 times higher than the US all industry average of 3.7 deaths per 100.000 workers per year (Bureau of Labor Census Fatal Occupational Injuries, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00136">2008</CitationRef>). However, farmers and ranchers nearly always die individually rather than in disaster events. Slowly accumulating deaths are less newsworthy, less noticed, and also less likely to promote congressional action for their prevention.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The US Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970, with the goal of developing and enforcing workplace safety standards, as well as offering compliance assistance. This legislation also resulted from a history of workplace disasters and unfair work practices that spanned two centuries. In the interest of brevity, only two landmark cases that had major impacts on occupational safety and health are described. Both involve multiple deaths of immigrant workers. The first was the New York City <Emphasis Type="Italic">Triangle Shirtwaist Factory</Emphasis> disaster event, in which hundreds of workers died in a single fire. The second involves the much greater number of wool mill textile workers who died in Lawrence, Massachusetts, where individuals died on a nearly daily basis over a period of many years.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00132">
                <Heading>The Triangle Shirtwaist Fire</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Triangle Fire</Emphasis> book by Leon Stein (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001368">2001</CitationRef>) provides a detailed account of this 1911 workplace disaster. Among many other sources, the Wikipedia account (with its 53 reference citations) is one of the most concise descriptions. One of several Triangle Shirtwaist factories in New York City was located in the Asch building adjacent to New York University at Washington Park Square. Approximately 500 young immigrant women, then referred to the “Shirtwaist girls,” worked on the top three floors of the 10 story building. Each floor, referred to as a loft, was an open room, 100 ft long and wide. The floors and long work tables were of wood construction. The girls cut and sewed fabric to produce the popular female bodice called a shirtwaist. Large stocks of fabric were stored on the three upper floors, as were large bins of scrap fabric. Even though New York City fire codes required three stairwells for buildings this size, only two circular enclosed stairwells were present. Each had narrow steps 2 ft, 9 in. long, with the narrow ends of each step attached to a single steel pole that ran from the tenth to the bottom floor.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Although building and fire codes called for doors that opened outward, the two doors to each floor opened inward. The doors were kept locked during work hours to prevent the girls from sneaking out with fabric or completed shirtwaists. Both doors at each floor were very narrow, allowing only one person to pass through at a time. At the end of the day, the girls lined up at one door. A company foreman first unlocked the door at the front of the building, and then allowed the girls to exit one-at-a time as he inspected their open purses for stolen items. The door at the rear of the building remained locked, and the two freight elevators that were operated by men located on the ground floor were unavailable. The only way out was via the one unlocked door on each floor that was attended by a foreman or via the one external fire escape at the rear of the building (Stein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001368">2001</CitationRef>). Immediately outside each door was the first narrow step on the circular stairway. There was no landing. That is why the doors had to open inward; a code violation that had been cited by a city inspector but that had been overridden by elected Borough officials who also overrode the building code violation that required three stairways. Descending the narrow stairwells required individuals to form a single line. The one fire escape in poor condition had stairs that led to the roof, as well as to the bottom of the sixth floor where, thereafter, it was damaged and unstable (Stein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001368">2001</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">On Saturday, March 25 at approximately 4:40 PM (5 min before quitting time), people on the street below heard an explosion and observed a puff of smoke from an eighth floor window. It was later determined that the fire started in a large scrap bin on the eighth floor, likely from a discarded cigarette even though smoking was prohibited. The sound of the explosion and the puff of smoke was probably the result of a “flash-over,” a condition when smoke and materials ignite instantly and fully engage the a room in fire. Almost immediately, people on the street below and in adjacent office buildings observed what they at first thought were bundles of fabric being thrown from the windows of the eighth floor by workers in an attempt to save fabric. Moments later the “bundles” were recognized as the bodies of girls, some of them with their hair and clothing in flames as they fell. Within minutes, the fire engulfed all three upper floors. There were no building fire alarms. A warning call from a book keeper on the eighth floor was received on the ninth floor at the same time that floor became engulfed in fire. The same bookkeeper received no response when she called the ninth floor. Within the next few minutes, many of the 500 workers escaped via one of three ways.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">During the first few minutes, many workers exited via the Green Street spiral stairway until it became engulfed in smoke and flame. Many more left by the freight elevators when two alert male elevator operators on the ground floor made three round trips to the top floors. After the third trip, the elevators became inoperable because the heat from the fire had warped their guide rails. At that point, dozens of workers and the two company owners exited via the exterior fire escape and climbed to the roof; all survived. Others workers crowded onto the exterior fire escape and climbed downward. The portion of the fire escape below the sixth floor collapsed under the weight of the crowd of girls, dropping them to their deaths 100 ft below. At that point, a large number of girls remaining on the exterior fire escape broke the windows to the sixth floor and entered that room that was free from fire and smoke. The girls attempted to leave via the Green Street circular stairway, but the door was locked. The foreman with the key to that door had already left for the outside. Many of these girls were saved by a police officer. He sensed the problem from the girls’ distressed calls from the sixth floor windows. He struggled up the stairs to the sixth floor against the line of descending girls. When he arrived at the sixth floor, he heard the girls screaming and banging on the door. After multiple lunges he broke open the door allowing many of these girls to escape. Shortly thereafter, even that only remaining escape route became impassible. At that point, the only way to escape the fire from the upper four floors was to climb onto the window ledges and jump seven to ten stories to the ground, a choice made by 62 workers only a few who were men. Others had unintentionally fallen and died when the lower portion of the external fire escape collapsed.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The last girl jumped at 4:57 PM. By that time, the bodies on the street covered the hoses that fire fighters had laid and were using to drench the upper floors. The one hand-cranked aerial fire truck ladder rescued no one because it reached only to the sixth floor. Likewise, the firefighter life nets were ineffective because the force of the falling bodies drove the nets to the pavement and injured the firefighters whose hands were looped to the nets. The fire was under control in 18 min. One hundred forty six workers died, 129 women and 17 men (Stein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001368">2001</CitationRef>; Wikipedia, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001375">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The two owners of the company (Max Blanck and Isaacs Harris) were among those who climbed to the roof and survived. Later, they were indicted on first and second degree manslaughter charges, but both were acquitted by a jury. In a later civil trial in 1913, the plaintiffs won $75 for each deceased worker. The owners’ insurance paid them $60,000 in excess of their losses (Stein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001368">2001</CitationRef>; Wikipedia, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001375">2012</CitationRef>). About a year later, Blanck was cited and fined $20 when building inspectors found that, during the work day, he had locked the doors on another factory he owned (Stein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001368">2001</CitationRef>). Subsequently, on November 25, 1910, 4 months before the Triangle fire, 25 workers died in a fire in a 4-story building in Newark, New Jersey. Six burned to death in the structure, and 19 jumped to their deaths. They too were locked into the building. The Triangle Company also had six previous fires at its factories in New York during the 1902 to the 1909 period. Two were in the Asch building, and the others at other locations. None resulted in injuries (Stein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001368">2001</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>The Lawrence Woolen Textile Mill Strike</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In 1789, industrial spinning machines were introduced in many New England factories Girls and young women immigrants were hired to work as spinsters (<Emphasis Type="Italic">a woman whose livelihood is spinning yarn</Emphasis>). Immigrants generally aroused suspicion and were disliked by established US citizens (Zinn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001378">2005</CitationRef>). Later, the term spinster became a slur used to denigrate <Emphasis Type="Italic">a woman who remained unmarried beyond the usual age</Emphasis> (Encarta Dictionary English North America, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001326">2012</CitationRef>). Power looms were introduced into Waltham, Massachusetts in 1814. The new machines could be operated by unskilled workers. The looms spread rapidly throughout New England, and employed tens of thousands of workers, 28,000 in the Lawrence, MA woolen mills alone. Lawrence had 86,000 residents from 51 nations who spoke 25 different languages. All lived and worked within a seven square mile area. Most of the immigrant mill workers were unskilled laborers. They ranged in age from 12 to 50 years. The majority were less than 30 years old, and many much younger. They and their families lived in crowded, low-quality company tenements, typically with two families or more living in the same two rooms that were cold in the winter and stiflingly hot in the summer. Their typical daily diet was bread and molasses. Fresh, clean tap water was in limited supply. Poor sanitation existed within the tenements, the streets, and the factories. Many workers and their children were malnourished (Wartson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001373">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The factories where these people worked were huge three or four story brick buildings, up to four city blocks long and 100 yards deep. When the workers entered the factories, the entrance and exit gates were chained and locked. Women and children worked on the lower floors or lofts where they sorted and cleaned cotton or wool and then spun and wound the material on spindles. The weaving rooms were on the upper floors, where rows of huge metal power looms were spaced along the length of the factory. Large metal arms on each loom hurled a steel shuttle and its thread back and forth two times a second through wooden frames that held the vertical strands. Loom operators often had to watch as many as 12 machines at once, a task that required high levels of sustained vigilance throughout the work day. The huge noise levels made conversation impossible. The average weekly wage was $8.76 for a 6-day, 9-hour work-day week (Wartson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001373">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Averaged across all workers, death typically occurred at age 39. Fifty percent of the children who lived in the tenements died before age 6 (Wartson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001373">2005</CitationRef>). A study by Dr. Elizabeth Shapleigh<Footnote ID="Fn00131">

She was one of the few women physicians at the time and one of the very first to practice occupational medicine. She died of typhus in the early 1930s in China where she worked as a missionary physician and teacher.</Para>
                  </Footnote> found that <Emphasis Type="Italic">a considerable numbers of workers boys and girls died within the first 2 or 3 years after beginning work</Emphasis> … <Emphasis Type="Italic">36 out of every 100 of all the men and women who work in the mill die before they are 25 years of age</Emphasis> (Zinn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001378">2005</CitationRef>, p. 335; quoted from Shapleigh, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001366">1912</CitationRef>). Both child workers and adults died from pneumonia, tuberculosis, and brown lung pneumoconiosis from the constant inhalation of the fiber-filled factory air. Others died from anthrax, which was commonly referred to as wool sorter’s disease. Anthrax spores in sheep wool typically entered workers’ bodies through cutaneous lesions. In addition, traumatic occupational injuries from being entangled in machinery or crushed by falling materials often resulted in severe injury or death. During one 5-year period, 1,000 workers at the Pacific Mill sustained serious injuries at the average of one injured worker every 2 days (Wartson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001373">2005</CitationRef>, p. 9). During the many years the textile mills operated, thousands of workers were fatally injured. In any 1 year, many more died than the fatality counts from the more dramatic and visible Triangle fire and major mine explosions and fire disasters.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The primary impact of the huge numbers of fatal illness and injuries to Lawrence textile mill workers began with what is called the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Bread and Roses</Emphasis> strike in which women workers were the key activists. The strike began when a new Massachusetts labor law reduced the work week from 56 to 54 h. The American Woolen Mill owned the four largest textile mills in Lawrence. Its president, William Wood, decided that, if work hours were to be cut, then so would workers’ pay by 32 cents per week. That does not sound like much but at a weekly wage of $8.76 for 6 days work, daily take home pay was $1.46. The 32¢ cut reduced daily pay to $1.14, a sum of money needed to purchase several loaves of bread (Wartson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001373">2005</CitationRef>, pp. 12–13; Zinn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001378">2005</CitationRef>, pp. 336–337). Organized largely by women, the strike continued for 2 months and was the largest in US history at that time. The mill workers walked out of the factories, some damaging equipment as they left. A week after the strike started, eight companies of armed militia encamped near the mills a week after the strike started. With the help of International Workers of the World (IWW) leaders and activists throughout surrounding States, the women placed their children, from age 4 to 14, on trains from Lawrence to New York City and Philadelphia. In both cities, the children were met and cared for by immigrant relatives and friends who led the children in protest parades down main streets. Sympathizers from multiple New England States became involved and sent food and soup kitchens to the Lawrence strikers (Wartson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001373">2005</CitationRef>; Zinn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001378">2005</CitationRef>). The strike ended shortly after textile worker women took additional children to the Lawrence railway station to be transported to other cities. As the women and children stood in line to enter the station, they were clubbed by police. Many were injured, some seriously. The public outcry and newspaper accounts of the story resulted in State and Federal legislators pressuring the American Woolen Company to relent and negotiate with the strikers. The strike ended on March 14, 1912. Workers’ wages were slightly increased, and time and a quarter pay granted for overtime time (Zinn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001378">2005</CitationRef>, p. 337).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Bread and Roses</Emphasis> name for the strike is based on a song written by James Oppeheim It was printed and widely circulated (quoted in Wartson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001373">2005</CitationRef>. p. 119). Two verses of the song follow.

                <Heading>The Present</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Finally, at the outset, it should also be pointed out that occupational safety and health issues and enforcement remain a continuously evolving process, as the nature of work in the United States has, over the past decades, changed from predominantly manufacturing to more service-based workplaces. This creates different safety and health issues. Moreover, the best methods to increase the “safety climate” of workplace environments are still greatly needed, especially in light of the fact that injuries and illnesses account for a 4–5% loss of the gross domestic product (Zohar, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001379">2011</CitationRef>). These “safety climate” issues range from problematic ergonomic/task activities, workplace hazards (such as chemical exposure, noise, dangerous equipment, etc.), to employer–employee cooperation in addressing and controlling such risk factors. Many of these workplace safety issues have been extensively addressed in previous publications over the years (e.g., Cohen &amp; Colligan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001311">1998</CitationRef>; DeJoy, Schaffer, Wilson, Vandenberg, &amp; Butts, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001324">2004</CitationRef>; Neal &amp; Griffin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001355">2006</CitationRef>; Zohar, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001379">2011</CitationRef>). A recent summary of the status of current efforts to reduce occupational injuries and illnesses states that it “… requires a multifaceted approach that can define hazards, evaluate risks, establish means to control risks, and incorporate management, supervision, and employees actively in the process” (Smith &amp; Carayon, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001367">2011</CitationRef>, p. 91). Many of these issues are briefly addressed in this Chapter. However, unlike previous publications, the present Chapter focuses on the changing trends in the present workplace, and new associated issues—particularly those related to contingent part-time and temporary workers. Such workers are becoming more prevalent in recent years because of the “downsizing” of the workforce by many companies, as well as the “outsourcing” of jobs to laborers who frequently are paid at or below minimum wage for difficult and dangerous work.</Para>

                <Heading>Haddon’s Injury Prevention Countermeasures</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">William Haddon Jr. is recognized as the person who applied the epidemiology of infectious disease science to the epidemiology of injury prevention. He conceptualized the ten injury prevention countermeasures (described in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00133">13.3</InternalRef>) that are widely used in the design of safe workplaces (Christoffel &amp; Gallagher, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001310">1999</CitationRef>). He also developed the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Haddon’s Injury Phase X Factor Matrix</Emphasis>, proposing that safety programs are effective to the extent that they intervene at the pre-event injury stage of the Matrix, and to the extent that they gather information about the human, injury agent, physical and social relationship factors that contribute to “close calls” and injury events (Haddon, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001333">1999</CitationRef>). Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00134">13.4</InternalRef> applies the Haddon Matrix to describe a fatal roadway crash between a heating and air conditioning contractor and a farm tractor operator. The National Safety Council reports that 40% of all workplace fatalities, and 30% of all disabling injuries, are the result of motor vehicle crashes, the majority of which occur when workers are traveling to and from their workplaces (National Safety Council, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001354">2009</CitationRef>).<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00133">

                <Para TextBreak="No">The roadway collision scenario described below occurred on a summer Friday evening. Both the subcontractor and the farmer were working overtime, and were rushing to begin their weekends. Sam was on route to service an inoperable cooling system for a grocery store located in a rural farming county 50 miles from the city where he was employed by a HVAC service company. He drove at 65 mph (95.5 ft/s), exceeding the posted limit of 45 mph (66.0 ft/s). As he rounded a curve in the road, he saw a slow-moving loaded hay wagon 400 ft. ahead of him (see Figs. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00131">13.1</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Fig00132">13.2</InternalRef>). He failed to notice cues of a likely left turn by the tractor, hay baler, and large hay wagon into a farm yard, even though a large barn and signs of haying were clearly visible on the left just ahead of the hay wagon. To avoid being stuck behind the farm equipment Sam accelerated to 70 mph (102.7 ft/s) to pass. Because of the loaded hay wagon and the tractor’s loud diesel engine, Jake, the tractor operator, could not see or hear the Sam’s truck approaching from the rear. Just as Jake turned his tractor left into the farmyard, Sam’s truck crashed into the tractor at full speed. Both he and the tractor operator died at the scene. Less than four seconds elapsed from the time Sam first saw the tractor until the crash. Had he braked immediately when he first saw the slow moving hay wagon he might possibly have avoided the crash. Even then, his speed reaction time and his truck’s stopping distance may have resulted in a crash, but at a lower velocity. Once he started to pass and pulled out 100 ft behind the tractor at 70 mph, there was insufficient time for him to do anything but hit the tractor and hay baler at full speed. This just described case is a collage constructed from many similar cases. It is available online from the <Emphasis Type="Italic">National Agricultural Safety Database</Emphasis> (Cole, Lehtola, Thomas, &amp; Hadley, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001320">2005</CitationRef>). Based on 4 years (1989–1992) of Ohio public road crash data, vehicle crashes with farm equipment are most frequent during peak traffic commute times. Left-turn collisions between farm equipment and other motor vehicles like the one described above are among the most frequent (29.8%), and the most deadly (Glascock, Bean, Wood, Carpenter, &amp; Holmes, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001330">1995</CitationRef>).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00131">

                <Para TextBreak="No">Collecting data only for serious injury events provides little information about frequent day-to-day departures from safe work practices, and the environmental and organizational factors that promote these unsafe actions. The conceptual tools of the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Haddon Engineering Counter-Measures</Emphasis> and the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Injury Phase X Factors Matrix</Emphasis>, when applied, promote regular monitoring of compliance with safe work practices. They also draw attention to workplace physical and social environment contingencies that cause workers who understand the hazards of their jobs, and the injuries that can result, to nevertheless engage in unsafe actions. Once identified, barriers to complying with safe work practices often can be removed by changes in work station design (ergonomics and engineering) and work organization (policy) procedures (Wiehagen, Lineberry, &amp; Rethi, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001374">1996</CitationRef>; Vaught, Brnich, Mallett, Cole, Wiehagen, &amp; Conti et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001371">2000</CitationRef>). Behavioral and conceptual analyses of common contingencies that cause experienced and skilled workers to engage in unsafe work practices are described in a number of papers, including the following: <Emphasis Type="Italic">Factors that Contribute to Miners Committing Unsafe Acts: A Behavioral Analysis</Emphasis> (Cole, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001314">1995</CitationRef>), <Emphasis Type="Italic">Toward a Typology of Dynamic and Hazardous Work Environments</Emphasis> (Scharf et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001364">2001</CitationRef>), <Emphasis Type="Italic">Cognitive-Behavioral Approaches to Farm Community Safety Education: A Conceptual Analysis</Emphasis> (Cole, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001316">2002</CitationRef>), and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Behavioral and Organizational Dimensions of Underground Mine Fires</Emphasis> (Vaught et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001371">2000</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Impact of Haddon’s Work on Safety Training</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Prior to the work of Haddon and his colleagues, formal safety instruction was naively assumed to be accomplished by presenting workers with safety rules and posters. Because of Haddon’s work, safety began to be understood and practiced as an ongoing process of modifying work environments to prevent injuries, developing new technologies and engineering controls to protect workers, in combination with changes in organizational structure and policy. Educational and behavioral interventions began to be understood <Emphasis Type="Italic">not</Emphasis> as the primary approach to injury prevention but as important means by which to promote manager and worker buy-in, as well as active participation and compliance with injury prevention technologies and work practices (Christoffel &amp; Gallagher, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001310">1999</CitationRef>, pp. 32–33). Another result of Haddon and his colleagues’ injury epidemiology work was the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Hierarchy of Controls Model</Emphasis> (The National Committee for Injury Prevention and Control, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001353">1989</CitationRef>). This paradigm orders the injury prevention effectiveness of three approaches. The first and most effective level of control is engineering controls that modify work stations, processes, or machinery in order to prevent workers from coming into contact with moving machinery, harmful atmospheres, chemicals, vapors, mists, dusts, or other injury agents and energy sources. Examples include constructing a work area or entire factory so that harmful dusts or vapors are completely captured or expelled to outside air, with no residual contamination remaining in the work area or factory. A second example is ground fault interrupter (GFI) electrical safety devices. If any part of a worker’s body comes into contact with a “hot” or live electrical wire or machine, resulting from an improperly grounded circuit, within milliseconds, the GFI shuts off the electrical current and the worker is unharmed. Without the GFI the worker will either sustain an electrical burn or be electrocuted.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The second level of control diminishes, but does not completely remove, workers’ exposure to a hazard. Examples include fresh outside intake air ventilation systems in underground coal mines. The fresh intake air sweeps through the mine entries and removes most of the coal dust generated from machines that cut and transport the coal out of the mine. It also removes and dilutes the methane gas that is released from the coal to concentrations below the explosive level. Yet, both respiratory coal dust and methane remain in the workplace, and both are higher at the face where the coal is being cut. As a result, workers still inhale small amounts of coal dust that, over time, can result in cumulative damage to the lungs called black lung or coal worker pneumoconiosis. Released <Emphasis Type="Italic">methane</Emphasis> also may collect in poorly ventilated sections of the mine, and may result in a deadly explosion. Another example is worker dependence on the thick and strong insulation on electrical power cables in underground mines. The cables are mounted on reels at the rear of large mining machines. As the machines advance, the cables drag on the mine floor. The cable insulation prevents worker contact with high voltage electrical energy. Over time, the large 440 V DC electrical cables that power large mining equipment can become damaged by being run over. The cable electrical insulation can become stretched, cut, cracked and frayed. When this happens, the GFI system shuts the power down because the damage allows small amounts of electrical energy to fault (escape) to the wet mine floor and/or directly through the metal body of an energized or “hot” mining machine to which the power cable is attached. At that point, the mining machines on that circuit stop. Finding and repairing such ground faults in power cables up to 900 ft long is time consuming and difficult. As a result, miners often disable the GFI apparatus in order to continue mining coal and maintain production schedules. Eight percent of coal miner deaths results from electrocutions and nonfunctional GFI systems (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001362">Reynolds, undated</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The third level of control involves workers’ use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the absence of level one and level two protective systems. Some coal mines and many surface mine sites have high levels of respirable coal and/or silica rock dust. Construction workers often cut rocks and bricks with electrical powered saws that produce thick clouds of dust. Often, the only available method of protection from long-term pneumoconiosis lung disease is the worker’s use of a NIOSH approved respirator. The loud noise generated by the cutting also requires hearing protection to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. Other exposures to toxic and caustic liquids require workers’ to wear fluid and chemical barrier gloves, aprons, eyewear, and sometimes full garments and self-contained breathing apparatus. PPE approaches are required when engineering controls are absent or impractical. Yet, they remain the least effective for protecting workers’ health for multiple reasons, including worker discomfort, failure to properly fit, wear, clean and maintain equipment. The author once conducted an evaluation study of the NIOSH occupational respiratory training program. As part of that program, 21 used quarter-face twin-cartridge respirators were collected from factory work areas. The majority had damaged or missing straps and distorted or damaged face masks. Some had small holes punched in the face mask near the mouth area. This allowed workers to insert a soda straw or a cigarette in order to drink or smoke while wearing their respirators.</Para>

                <Heading>The Heinrich Injury Pyramid</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">For many years, the primary measure of occupational safety was the number of fatalities that occurred at a company. Few fatal events were seen as evidence of a safe workplace. Workplace fatalities are an unreliable and problematic metric by which to measure, report, and improve workplace safety and health because they tend to fluctuate widely and sometimes wildly from year to year. Even today fatality rates sometimes are the <Emphasis Type="Italic">only</Emphasis> metric used to report workplace safety status. This was, in part, because fatalities are more notable and are reported both within a company and also by public media.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">As the Heinrich (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001335">1959</CitationRef>) injury pyramid and its adaption by Bird and Germain and others became known and understood it focused attention on reporting and collecting data for “close calls,” minor injury events and injuries and illnesses, serious and fatal injuries. This comprehensive collection of data proved to be much more informative and effective for identifying workplace hazards and then implementing preventive interventions. It is important to note that the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Injury Pyramid</Emphasis> in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00133">13.3</InternalRef> does not include all noncompliance and “close call” events. A 2003 study by ConocoPhillips Marine reported that, for every fatality, there were at least 300,000 at-risk behaviors that were not in compliance with company safety programs, training, and work practices. Common examples included “short cuts,” such as bypassing safety systems on machinery or eliminating a step in a safety procedure, because following a safety protocol was perceived as slowing production (Freibott, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001328">2012</CitationRef>). The pre-event contingencies that produce close calls are often identical to those that result in serious injury and death. Collecting and tabulating data for close call events leads to the proactive identification and removal or control of injury risk factors. For example, ongoing monitoring of regular workers, contractors and contingent workers’ compliance with lock-out/tag-out safety protocols prevents both close calls and injury events.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00133">

              <Heading>Traditional Forms of Capital and Social Relations</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">There are basically three forms of <Emphasis Type="Italic">capital</Emphasis> (i.e., accumulated worth) that influence social relations among individuals across a wide range of social communities including workplace communities (Bourdieu, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00134">1986</CitationRef>; Putnam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001361">2000</CitationRef>). The first is <Emphasis Type="Italic">economic capital</Emphasis>, sometimes referred to as <Emphasis Type="Italic">physical capital</Emphasis>. It involves owning or having control over money and other tangible assets. Economic capital can be, and often is, inherited or transferred to others. The second form is <Emphasis Type="Italic">social capital</Emphasis>. It refers to durable informal and formal social networks of individuals who trust, respect, and help each other. Members of social networks differ in terms of talents, wealth, and status, but are valued for their varied roles and contributions. Individuals within communities (including workplace communities) with high social capital are happier, healthier, and safer than groups with low social capital (Putnam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001361">2000</CitationRef>). <Emphasis Type="Italic">Social capital</Emphasis>, in turn, has two forms—bonding and bridging. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Bonding social capital</Emphasis> occurs within groups that are tightly connected for a variety of ethnic, cultural, or economic reasons. It is common within guilds, trades, and professional organizations, with certification and licensing requirements that both protect markets and ensure that members meet professional standards. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Bonding social capital</Emphasis> can lead to group self-interest, exclusion, and dysfunctional social relations within larger communities, including workplace communities. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Bridging social capital</Emphasis> is sometimes referred to as <Emphasis Type="Italic">linking social capital</Emphasis>. It is present or absent in varying degrees in any community including workplace communities. In workplaces, <Emphasis Type="Italic">bridging social capital</Emphasis> links together individuals with varied levels of skills, social and economic status, power, and responsibility. It promotes bonds of mutual respect, trust, reciprocity, and collaboration across the worker, supervisor, and manager hierarchy. Workplaces with such structure are happier, safer, and more productive (Putnam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001361">2000</CitationRef>). Social capital is sometimes thought of as social climate. Finally, the third form is <Emphasis Type="Italic">cultural capital</Emphasis>, sometimes referred to as <Emphasis Type="Italic">human capital</Emphasis>. It arises from individuals’ accumulated experiences, knowledge, skills, expectations, and wisdom (Cole &amp; Donovan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001318">2008</CitationRef>; Putnam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001361">2000</CitationRef>). Unlike <Emphasis Type="Italic">economic capital</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">cultural capital</Emphasis> cannot be inherited, but can be fostered and nurtured by coworker, supervisor, and manager mentors.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The relationship among the three forms of capital can be summarized as follows. Economic assets (<Emphasis Type="Italic">physical capital</Emphasis>) and individual experience and education (<Emphasis Type="Italic">human capital</Emphasis>), when embedded in social networks with norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness, result in individual and collective well-being, known as <Emphasis Type="Italic">social capital</Emphasis> (Putnam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001361">2000</CitationRef>). This, in turn, can result in safe workplaces. Indeed, a multiyear Department of Interior-funded study in the early 1980s suggested that workplaces with these aforementioned social capital characteristics experienced few occupational injuries. A team of psychologists, sociologists, business administrators, rehabilitation counselors, as well as civil, mining, and human factors engineers, identified and reviewed studies reported in professional journals and government documents that identified factories and manufacturing plants with exceptionally low occupational injury rates over an extended period of years (Cole et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001317">1986</CitationRef>). These companies addressed hazard identification, risk perception, risk communication, risk reduction, and injury prevention as an ongoing process integrated into daily work practice. Safety was <Emphasis Type="Italic">not</Emphasis> assigned exclusively to a company safety officer or safety department, but rather to each worker, first-line supervisor and managers as well. Daily workplace safety inspections were conducted pre- and post-shift. If at any time, a safety hazard or unsafe work activity was observed, it was immediately addressed. For example, a liquid spill in a walkway observed by a worker, supervisor, or manager was immediately cleaned up and reported, as were incidents involving unsafe work practices such as failure to wear a hard hat or eye protection, backing a forklift without looking to the rear, or climbing on a chair to replace a light bulb instead of using a step ladder. The seven common characteristics of these safe workplaces are listed in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00135">13.5</InternalRef> (Cole et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001317">1986</CitationRef>).<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00135">

                    <SimplePara>Although it is informative to know the characteristics of safe work places, it is not an easy matter to change those which are not safe. Some of the characteristics are not subject to change by the company itself, the industry, or by regulatory agencies (e.g., characteristics of the workforce, financial solvency of the company, changes in technology. Changes to improve both safety and production may require long-term comprehensive approaches (Cohen &amp; Swift, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001380">1999</CitationRef>)</SimplePara>

              <Para TextBreak="No">The very low occupational injury rates among the companies identified in the Cole et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001317">1986</CitationRef>) study can be understood within the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Haddon Injury Prevention Counter-Measures</Emphasis>, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Injury Phase X Factor Matrix</Emphasis>, and the of the 1959 <Emphasis Type="Italic">Heinrich Injury Pyramid</Emphasis>, and its <CitationRef CitationID="CR00133">1996</CitationRef> adaptation by Bird and Germain, as earlier depicted in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00134">13.4</InternalRef>. At the individual company level, fatal occupational injuries are rare events that, when investigated, can lead to safer work environments and practices. However, fatality investigations alone provide limited utility for robust surveillance and epidemiological analyses. “Close call” events (near misses) occur much more frequently than do even minor injuries. One of the reasons that safety programs like those described in the previous section are successful is that they monitor ongoing compliance and noncompliance with safe work practices. “Close calls” are understood to have the same array of contingencies that result in minor, serious and fatal injuries. Safety programs that involve workers, supervisors and managers in ongoing monitoring and abating or mitigating workplace hazards prevent “close calls,” as well as minor, serious and fatal injuries. Safety programs that focus primarily on collection and review of injury events promote <Emphasis Type="Italic">hindsight</Emphasis> at the expense of <Emphasis Type="Italic">foresight</Emphasis>. Foresight is necessary to anticipate, recognize, control, and prevent emergent hazards that occur in all workplaces (Fischoff, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001327">1975</CitationRef>; Cole, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001315">1997</CitationRef>; Cole, Vaught, Wiehagen, Haley, &amp; Brnich, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001323">1998</CitationRef>). Companies using prevention methods, like those described earlier in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00133">13.3</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Tab00134">13.4</InternalRef>, ­proactively avoid injuries and their associated costs by ongoing monitoring of workplace hazards and compliance with safe work practices.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">The above section documented the importance of <Emphasis Type="Italic">social capital</Emphasis> in the workplace. Indeed, work is a social activity, with the same types of social needs and interactions common to other social groups. Prior to the 1980s and early 1990s, many manufacturing companies and a wide variety of other businesses hired workers on a long term-basis. What often resulted was a social community with reciprocal relationships of trust, mutual respect, and cooperation among workers and managers that benefited the company, the workers and the larger society. Workplaces with these characteristics and long-term worker employment typically are safe and productive (Cohen &amp; Prusak, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001312">2001</CitationRef>,Gochfeld &amp; Mohr, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001331">2007</CitationRef>, Putnam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001361">2000</CitationRef>). Indeed, prior to the 1980s, a widely practiced and central assumption of employee-management relations was an unwritten but tacit understanding by both parties that workers hired who performed well would become career employees. In many cases, this expectation occurred. Full-time employment of workers in steel mills, automobile and manufacturing plants, as well as in many service industries, was commonplace from the 1940s up to the 1980s (Putnam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001361">2000</CitationRef>)</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">With rapid changes in technology, production and globalization, tacit long-term employment contracts became increasingly rare during the downsizing, restructuring, re-engineering and outsourcing that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. During 1993–1994, nearly 50% of all US firms downsized their employees by an average of 10%. This trend continues for both blue and white color workers who are increasingly employed in temporary or part-time positions across nearly all private and public sectors (Putnam, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001361">2000</CitationRef>; Hipple, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001336">2001</CitationRef>). The Department of Labor refers to members of this population as <Emphasis Type="Italic">alternative</Emphasis> or <Emphasis Type="Italic">contingent workers</Emphasis>, that is, individuals who report that their jobs are temporary without an implicit or explicit contract or expectation for continued employment (Department of Labor, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001325">2005</CitationRef>). Contingent workers range across socioeconomic and educational levels, from unskilled and unschooled to highly educated and skilled. They work as day laborers, freelancers, on-call workers, independent contractors, and leased hires from contract labor firms. They are employed in agriculture, construction, manufacturing, transportation, hazardous waste work, health care, public service, law enforcement, the military, and nearly all other sectors. Across many sectors contingent workers tend to be young, inexperienced and at increased risk for both nonfatal and fatal injury (Department of Labor, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001325">2005</CitationRef>; Guerrina, Burns, &amp; Conlon, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001332">2011</CitationRef>; Gochfeld &amp; Mohr, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001331">2007</CitationRef>; Hipple, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001336">2001</CitationRef>; Oh &amp; Shin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001358">2003</CitationRef>). Contingent workers often are without workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance. A recent study identified 1,023 patients who visited an emergency department at a university medical center during 2005 because of a work-related injury that was confirmed by the medical staff. Twenty percent (209/1,023) were not covered by workers’ compensation insurance. Of the 209 without workers’ compensation insurance, 92% also lacked health insurance (Nicholson, Bunn, &amp; Costich, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001356">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Reasons for Outsourcing and Subcontracting</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Outsourcing work to subcontractors is widely practiced to lower costs, to employ workers with special skills, and to diversify risk (Gochfeld &amp; Mohr, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001331">2007</CitationRef>). Individuals or contracting companies that win contracts often do so by operating at the lowest possible cost. This economic constraint often means there is little time for safety training, as well as too little time and money to properly maintain and upgrade equipment. Examples include general contracting companies that operate equipment with damaged or missing machine guards, and whose workers are without personal protective equipment. For example, rock drill rigs and crews are familiar sights at highway, building construction, and surface mine sites. In the author’s experience, rarely does one observe drill rig contract workers wearing respiratory protection, and frequently no hearing protection even when exposed to very high concentrations of rock dust and high decibel noise levels. Small business general contractors and small farm operators and their contract laborers also often work with older equipment that, while functional, is compromised by a range of safety problems that place workers at increased injury risk. For example, mobile powered equipment with missing shields on PTO drivelines, inoperable backup alarm warning systems, broken or faulty lighting and marking, absence of fully charged and functional fire extinguishers, as well as bent, broken, or missing access steps and hand-holds for mounting and dismounting equipment, are widely prevalent (Cole et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001322">2009</CitationRef>). These conditions and unfamiliarity with hazards peculiar to a series of different work sites during short-term job placements increase contract risk for injury (Gochfeld &amp; Mohr, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001331">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Contract Workers and Injury Risk</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Park and Butler (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001359">2001</CitationRef>) identified contract workers’ injury risk by comparing workers’ compensation costs for full-time workers with two types of contingent workers—“regular part-time workers” and “leased workers.” Both the full-time and regular part-time workers were paid by the companies where they performed work, and both received worker’s compensation insurance. The leased workers were paid by a contractor and received no wages or worker’s compensation coverage from the host companies where they worked. Regular full-time workers were more likely to be male, older, and better paid than regular part-time workers. Yet, they did not differ in terms of their workers’ compensation claim frequency, injury severity, or claim denial rates, even though they differed demographically. However, the “leased” workers’ compensation injuries were <Emphasis Type="Italic">three times</Emphasis> greater than for regular workers, and <Emphasis Type="Italic">ten times</Emphasis> greater than for regular part-time workers, even when controlling for age, gender, industry, type and date of injury. The leased employees had a much higher number of claims, and also significantly higher injury severity claims. This strongly suggests that contracted or self-employed transient workers, who come onto a company property only occasionally for short periods, have limited contact with other workers and little opportunity for integration into the company work organization social structure and its safety practices. Errors in hazards communication between the company’s full-time workforce and the contract workers often result (Gochfeld &amp; Mohr, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001331">2007</CitationRef>; Park &amp; Butler, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001359">2001</CitationRef>). Because of the transient nature of their jobs, contingent workers often are excluded from the safety instruction, safety policies and safety supervision at the sites where they work (Kalleberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001340">2000</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Small independent contracting companies and their workers generally do not participate in host company safety training or in local or regional safety training sessions, even when such sessions are available at no cost. Taking time to attend a safety session is perceived as too costly. While away from their jobs sites, small contractors risk unsafe or improperly completed work by unsupervised workers, missed deadlines, earning a “bad reputation,” and losing customers (Kidd, Parshall, Wojcik, &amp; Struttmann, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001342">2004</CitationRef>). Small labor contractors also work in a constantly changing environment that includes not only weather changes, but also the availability and costs of materials and a changing workforce. For example, a small roofing contractor company owner with two long-term experienced workers can complete most jobs safely, efficiently, and well. However, when one worker leaves to start his own roofing company, and/or when a bigger job is contracted, the owner may have to hire unskilled labor from a general labor contract organization or unemployment office. Having two or three inexperienced roofers slows the rate at which work can be completed, risks compromising work quality and safety. It not only also increases the risk of injury to the transient inexperienced workers, but to the contractor and his skilled workers as well. Many contract workers are not covered by workers’ compensation insurance, and a majority lack health insurance (Kidd et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001342">2004</CitationRef>; Lineberry, Scharf, &amp; Wiehagen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001345">2003</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Economics and Injury Consequences of Subcontracting</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A case study examined the Department of Energy and its prime subcontractors’ practices of outsourcing work to subcontractors at hazardous chemical and nuclear waste sites, as well as similar practices in the US petrochemical industry (Gochfeld &amp; Mohr, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001331">2007</CitationRef>). In each case, the short-term benefits for hiring subcontractor contingent workers as opposed to “regular hires” were the same. Hiring temporary workers reduces payroll and worker benefit costs. It facilitates hiring workers with technical expertise or unskilled laborers on an “as needed” basis for short periods of time. It also transfers parent company and prime contractor responsibility for the safety training and supervision of contingent workers, as well as compliance with the OSHA Rules of Construction (29 CFR 1926.16), even though the rules state that companies and their subcontractors, each individually and jointly, assume responsibility for worker safety and health. OSHA increasingly relies on voluntary compliance rather than enforcement. Subcontractors often do not report their workers’ injuries. Thus, total the number of contingent workers and their annual hours of exposure are unknown. As a result, injury epidemiological studies by OSHA or by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) program are compromised because denominator data are missing. Deaths are more likely to be reported than nonfatal injuries or illnesses, but not even all deaths are reported.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">One study with incomplete data found that 59% of workers who died in trench collapse on Department of Energy (DOE) job sites were subcontractor employees (Gochfeld &amp; Mohr, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001331">2007</CitationRef>). Alfonso Alverez’s death in a trench in 2002 is a typical case. While working for a Texas construction company the 17-yearo old was laying a water line in an un-shored trench. A trench cave-in buried the lad to his waist. During the 30 min required to free him he Alfonso remained alive but died later that day from asphyxia and other injuries. Asphyxia deaths of this type result when heavy earth pushes the internal organs in the abdomen upward against the diaphragm. The individual then is unable to inhale and fill his or her lungs with air. OSHA cited the company for nine health and safety violations, three of which were willful (Hopkins, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001337">2003</CitationRef>). Trenching and excavating are recognized as one of the most hazardous construction operations. OSHA revised Subpart P, Excavations, 29 CFR 1926.650, 29 CFR 1926.651, and 29 CFR 1926.652 require that all trenches through soil and unstable material must be shored or widely angled at the top to prevent cave ins and worker entrapment.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In hazardous waste work and in the petrochemical industry, contingent workers hired by subcontractors tend to be younger and less experienced than regular workers. In addition, some companies that employ subcontracted temporary workers advise managers to avoid assuming responsibility for safety training and supervision of the workers in order to avoid liability issues (Gochfeld &amp; Mohr, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001331">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Underground coal mining companies also outsource complex, difficult and dangerous jobs to subcontractors. For example, after a large mining company’s workers have completed “room and pillar” mining, they sometimes contract with small mining companies whose workers extract the coal pillars. The pillars are rectangular blocks of coal with dimensions of 80  ×  100 ft. The pillars are left in place between parallel sets of entries (longitudinal tunnels) and cross cuts (perpendicular tunnels) from which the coal is cut. The pillars are left in place during mining to prevent the mine roof from collapsing. The small contractor companies hired to remove the pillars proceed in a carefully planned sequence. When performed correctly, the mine roof collapses in a controlled manner as the contract miners and their equipment cut the coal from the pillars and retreat toward the outside. Although inherently dangerous, removing the pillars is highly profitable because it yields a high coal tonnage with a minimum of equipment, time and effort. By outsourcing removal of pillars, the larger mining company shifts the risk of injury and the associated costs and liability from its regular workers to the contractors. During his years of coal mine safety research, the author met with such a small retreat mining contracting company. The entire workforce consisted of two brothers and their six sons who worked with old and used equipment.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Small roofing companies, building framers, and general construction companies also often work as contractors for other host companies. These workers seldom have time to attend safety meetings or to participate in other types of safety training, except for the training they receive on the job from the owner-operator and their coworkers. As part of a NIOSH-funded project, Dr. Pamela Kidd at the University of Kentucky, Dr. Ted Scharf at the NIOSH Taft Laboratory, the author, and others worked with the Kentucky Employees Mutual Insurance Company (KEMI) on a project to lower injury rates among construction companies with ≤10 employees. The incentive was KEMI’s lowering workers’ compensation premiums for construction companies whose owners and workers participated in the program. Six tabletop interactive narrative simulation exercises that depicted construction-related fall and back injury cases were developed. The simulations were designed to teach and simultaneously assess workers’ decision making with respect to selecting safe work practices versus quicker but high-risk actions (Cole, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001313">1994</CitationRef>). Random samples of owner-operators, supervisors, and workers completed the simulations and judged them to be relevant and useful for identifying and preventing errors that lead to injuries (Wojcik, Kidd, Parshall, &amp; Struttmann, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001377">2003</CitationRef>). However, it proved difficult to deliver the interventions because most small contractors and their workers were so busy working at their trade that they had little time for any form of formal safety training. In addition, many believed that they already knew how to work safely. Group administrations of the simulations at local meetings proved ineffective because of poor attendance. Completing the simulations individually at home was more popular, but the overall participation rate was only 26.7% (Kidd et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001342">2004</CitationRef>). In addition, completing the simulations at home deprived the workers of the valuable and vigorous dialog and interaction that occur when small groups of workers collaborate in completing the tabletop simulation exercises. While at work, individuals frequently talk about, and evaluate approaches to problems that arise. To the extent possible, workplace technical and safety training should do the same (Cole, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001313">1994</CitationRef>; <CitationRef CitationID="CR001315">1997</CitationRef>; Cole et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001323">1998</CitationRef>). In addition, farmers who regularly hire part-time and seasonal workers, face similar problems in finding workers who can competently operate farm machinery. Like small contractors, many farmers are too busy to attend local safety training sessions (Cole, Kidd, Isaacs, Parshall, &amp; Scharf, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001319">1997</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Immigrant Workers at Highest Risk of Injury</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Immigrants comprise 12.5% of the US Population and 15.6% of the labor force. Many are employed as contingent workers with no health or retirement benefits. They tend to work in low-wage, low-skill and what is referred to as 3 D jobs (dirty, dangerous, and difficult). (Schenker, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001365">2010</CitationRef>). Hispanics are among the most rapidly growing members of the US workforce. During the 2003–2006 period, 67% of the Hispanic workers who died in workplace injury events were foreign born. Approximately 70% of these deaths were persons born in Mexico (MMWR, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00136">2008</CitationRef>). During 2000 Hispanics comprised 15% of US construction workers, but 23.5% of the fatalities (Schenker, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001365">2010</CitationRef>). From 1992 to 2001 during the US economic boom period, workplace fatality rates for Hispanic workers rose 15.1% while, during that same period, the rate for all other workers fell by 15.4% (Bureau of Labor, Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, 2008). Deaths of Hispanic workers were distributed as follows: construction 34%; administrative and waste services 11%; agriculture forestry and fishing 10%; and transportation warehousing 10% (MMWR, 2006).</Para>

              <Heading>Injury Risk Is Greater in Dynamic Work Environments</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Many of the models for identifying, communicating, and managing injury risks were developed for manufacturing plants and similar workplaces. In such places, much of the equipment and many of the workers are in relatively fixed locations, and are engaged in relatively ordered and routine sets of tasks. Other workplaces are more dynamic and less static (Scharf et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001364">2001</CitationRef>). Examples include underground mines where the workers daily carve out and enlarge their work space on a daily basis, and constantly advance their equipment, supply lines, and their product output and transport system. This is accomplished while working in dark, restricted spaces in close proximity to noisy and very large equipment. As the mine advances, even the best geological maps and technology cannot predict all the potential hazards that may emerge. These include, among others, cutting into old works and rapid inundations of “black damp” (oxygen deficient atmospheres) or water, and encountering sections with small geologic faults and/or nonconformities that can result in roof falls. Working in an underground mine is much more dynamic and unpredictable than working on the assembly line of a typical manufacturing plant.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Other highly dynamic work environments include logging, commercial fishing, and many types of agricultural production. The large majority of US electrical power company linemen are contractors. Electrical linemen contractors conduct emergency repair work during and following major ice and wind storms. During major outages they typically travel long distances from other States to areas with damage. They conduct repair work while working at heights with combinations of “live” and “dead” power lines that can become energized by local farmers’ and businesses’ emergency electrical generators feeding back into the system. As linemen work, they also are at risk from strong wind, falling trees and debris from damaged structures. Additional risks are associated with working in unfamiliar territory, in combination with local emergency response crews whose individuals and collective work practices may differ from theirs. For example, on January 29, 2009, a 35-year old guest utility worker from a small Minnesota contracting company died when he and a local lineman fell 40 ft from a utility pole while repairing a power line damaged in a major Kentucky ice storm. Visibility was limited because of darkness and sleet. A utility truck that slid into a ditch was being towed out of the ditch by a second truck. In the darkness and bad weather, no one noticed that the truck being towed had become entangled in a steel support cable attached to the utility pole. As the towed truck advanced the support cable snapped the utility pole in half. Both linemen fell. A 300 pound transformer fell on the worker who died. The local lineman sustained non-life-threatening injuries (The Crittenden Press Online, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001369">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Subcontracted iron workers and construction crews also work in highly dynamic, emerging structures and unstable environments that include changes in wind and weather conditions, working at heights on temporary structures, and in close proximity to heavy loads of materials being moved and lifted by large machinery. In addition, construction sites usually include many contract laborers who are needed for short periods of time. Construction of large multistory buildings in restricted spaces adjacent to busy city streets and adjacent buildings confine a wide range of workers, equipment, and materials in close proximity. Removal of soil and rock, delivery, unloading, storage, movement, and hoisting of equipment and construction materials is an ongoing process that exposes large numbers and varieties of contract workers to potential injury. Contract and part-time workers at such sites, which span a wide range of trades and experience, are the rule rather than the exception. Traffic and construction noise tend to drown out backup alarms that occur so frequently from multiple machines that workers on foot have difficulty discriminating a source. Workers also can habituate to such frequent warning signals. It is unlikely that a single hazard identification, risk perception, and risk communication model will fit all combinations of the various populations of contract workers, and the wide array of static and dynamic environments in which they work (Scharf et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001364">2001</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Robert Peters and his colleagues at the NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory studied the contingencies that cause experienced underground coal miners to intentionally move under unsupported mine roof and risk severe injury or death from a roof fall, even when they are aware of the potential fatal injury (Peters &amp; Randolph, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001360">1991</CitationRef>). The contingencies that motivate this behavior are primarily economic. Going under an unsupported roof, while dangerous, is a safety shortcut. A miner working at the face (where coal is cut) can move quickly to a parallel entry (tunnel) by dashing 80 ft through a cross cut (tunnel) where the roof is not yet supported. The safe alternative route is for the miner to circle three sides of an 80  ×  100 foot coal pillar in passage ways where the mine roof has been bolted to the upper rock strata. Coal seams in Eastern Kentucky mines average around 52 in. in height. Taking the safe route requires the miner to stoop walk 280 ft, while perhaps carrying 30–40 pounds of equipment. The safe route results in high physical energy costs for the miner, and lost production time for the mine section crew. Both conspire to encourage managers to “look the other way” and provide miners with tacit approval to engage in this dangerous and <CitationRef CitationID="CR001347">MSHA</CitationRef>-prohibited practice. Because of these workplace contingencies, 90% of miners have engaged in this behavior on a few occasions, but fewer than 5% do so on a regular basis (Peters &amp; Randolph, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001360">1991</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Heading>Promoting Safety Practices by Examining the Cost</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">For multiple years, teams of researchers at the University of Kentucky have used occupational injury simulation exercises and case materials, in combination with economic analyses of occupational injuries related to farming. These intervention materials demonstrate the huge cost of low probability but serious work-related injuries, and the low cost of safety equipment and safety practices that prevent costly injury events (Cole et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001319">1997</CitationRef>; Isaacs, Cole, &amp; Gross, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001339">1997</CitationRef>; Myers, Cole, &amp; Mazur, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001350">2005</CitationRef>; Myers, Cole, Mazur, &amp; Isaacs, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001351">2006</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001352">2008</CitationRef>). Decision analysis and cost tools developed by Melvin Myers are used to calculate the probabilities of the injuries, their direct and indirect costs, and the cost effectiveness of their prevention through readily available protective interventions. The tools demonstrate graphically the huge costs of low probability events, such as operator disability or death from overturning a tractor without a roll bar, and the effect of the injury costs on revenue. If a farm or other business with a profit margin of 10% experiences even a relatively minor injury that results in $10,000 of direct costs, the operation must produce an additional $100,000 of revenue to offset the direct cost associated with the injury event. In addition, indirect costs associated with the injury event, such as lost work time, also negatively impact cash flow and revenue (Myers et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001352">2008</CitationRef>). It is not possible for most small farm operators and many larger operations to increase either their production or markets to overcome the revenue lost related to even relatively minor injury events. Serious occupational injuries, especially those that result in full or partial disability, can result in direct costs of hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Criminal and civil law suits can impose additional staggering losses. When potential injury events and their costs are examined in this way, the revenue protection value of investing in safety equipment and safe work practices becomes more apparent. Larger and well-managed companies generally are aware of these facts. Smaller farm operations and small business contractors, though, are often less aware and less capable of surviving such injury events. Unfortunately, changing farmers’ ingrained attitudes against taking actions to improve safety often requires a severe injury event or death, and its associated huge personal and economic costs. A key aspect of using stories based on real farming injury cases, in combination with economic analysis cost tools, is that attitudes and behavior changes that support safe work practices can emerge before a catastrophic injury event occurs (Cole, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001316">2002</CitationRef>). Perhaps similar methods can be developed and used with small business contractors whose workers are not well integrated into larger companies’ work organization and safety practices.</Para>

                <Heading>Narrative Guides and Directs Behavior, Including Safety Behavior</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A large body of research suggests that a primary method by which humans understand what they should value and believe, and how they should act in their personal, social, and work roles, is based on internalized stories or narratives (Bandura, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00132">1989</CitationRef>; Bruner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00135">1990</CitationRef>; Cole, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001315">1997</CitationRef>; Sarbin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001363">1986</CitationRef>). Sometimes these narratives are referred to as <Emphasis Type="Italic">culture tales</Emphasis> (Cole, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001315">1997</CitationRef>; Howard, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001338">1991</CitationRef>). The <Emphasis Type="Italic">culture tales</Emphasis> of workers and managers in mines, factories, agricultural, and other businesses are pervasive and powerful influences on workers’ attitudes, what they believe are effective safety practices, and what they are willing to do or not do with respect to working safely. People who are otherwise intelligent, self-efficacious, and safety-conscious may believe that seat belts do not protect them, but instead place them at increased risk of being trapped in a burning vehicle during a crash. Consequently, they will not wear seat belts. Workers exposed to silica dust as they saw concrete or operate rock drilling rigs, and suffer no apparent ill effects from unprotected dust exposures, often will not wear respirators because they believe that doing so does not protect them from lung disease. Witte’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001376">1992</CitationRef>) extended <Emphasis Type="Italic">Parallel Process Model</Emphasis> of human behavior refers to this type of reasoning as <Emphasis Type="Italic">response efficacy</Emphasis>. If workers believe that a prescribed safety behavior is effective for preventing injury or illness, they are likely to comply. If they believe a safety procedure is ineffective for preventing injury or illness, they will not comply. Such beliefs often are based on internalized stories or <Emphasis Type="Italic">culture tales</Emphasis> that are not easily changed, even by scientifically sound evidence. This is especially true when the ill effects of a harmful behavior do not appear until well into the future, and at that point become punishing. At that point in time, the immediate reinforcement for the harmful behavior “short cut” pales in comparison as the severe illness or injury consequences emerge. Common health examples include smokers who derive immediate and powerful reinforcement from smoking and, in most cases, for which the profoundly and painful adverse punishers do not become apparent until years later. Chronic overeating, obesity, and drug and alcohol dependency are difficult to overcome for similar reasons. The same principles apply to many workers’ reluctance or refusal to wear respiratory, hearing, eye protection, and seat belts.</Para>

                <Heading>How Attitudes are Learned</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Knowledge of how to work productively and safely within a factory or mine is shared safety information (often called <Emphasis Type="Italic">declarative knowledge</Emphasis>). It can be taught by providing workers with oral, visual or printed language explanations. Safe work practice procedures (often called <Emphasis Type="Italic">procedural knowledge</Emphasis>) can be taught by demonstrating the proper completion of a series of actions, and having the worker practice and perfect the performance. Both of these methods are referred to as <Emphasis Type="Italic">direct instruction</Emphasis>. However, the teaching of beliefs and attitudes related to the injury prevention value of wearing a respirator, wearing hearing protection, and always wearing a seat belt when operating motor vehicles is a different matter. In these and similar cases, direct instruction is typically ineffective or counterproductive (Bandura, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00132">1989</CitationRef>; Gagne, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001329">1984</CitationRef>; Cole, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001316">2002</CitationRef>). The noncompliant individual may not be influenced by the instruction, or may resent being told what he or she should believe and value. Two indirect methods of instruction that are effective for teaching safety attitudes and beliefs are the behaviors of human models with whom workers identify, and the <Emphasis Type="Italic">culture tales</Emphasis> (stories) that permeate the work environment. These stories describe whom workers should trust and what they should believe and do to work safely and effectively (Cole, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001315">1997</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001316">2002</CitationRef>; Cole et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001323">1998</CitationRef>; Vaught, Mallett, Brnich, Reinke, &amp; Kowalski-Trakofler et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001372">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusions and Future Directions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">One of the most insightful papers regarding workers’ self-protective behaviors and the theoretical models that attempt to explain such behavior was published 16 years ago (DeJoy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001381">1996</CitationRef>). That paper classified previous workplace safety studies into three broad categories. The first are studies of employee personal and demographic characteristics as they relate to workers’ safety performance. The second are behavioral intervention studies that use operant conditioning learning theory and contingent reinforcement to shape specific desired safety behaviors and to extinguish unsafe behaviors. The third are studies that focus on the correlates of safe work practices by identifying and studying common characteristics of factories and other workplaces that have very low injury rates over multiple year periods. DeJoy also summarized three major theoretical models that attempted to predict health behaviors. The first are cost-benefit models that describe individual worker choices based on value-expectancy theory (e.g., <Emphasis Type="Italic">Why should I put up with the discomfort a respirator and being unable to talk or drink? I know that only a small percentage of coal miners die from black lung disease!</Emphasis>). The second are environmental-contextual models that focus not only on individual worker personal characteristics as predictors of behavior, but also on workers’ decisions that arise from interactions with each other, mangers and changing physical environment variables (e.g.<Emphasis Type="Italic">, The overhead conveyor chain is jammed for the third time tonight. The foreman is screaming at me to fix it immediately or we will not meet our production schedule. I don’t have time to get the ladder and the plywood tank cover. I’ll climb up on the dip tank frame, reach up and clear the jam.</Emphasis>
                <Footnote ID="Fn00132">
                  <Para TextBreak="No">This scenario describes a permanently disabling injury event that resulted when the author’s younger brother fell into a large tank filled with a 140 °F solution of water and phosphoric acid that was used to degrease metal components for large commercial electrical meters. He spent 6 months in the Massachusetts General Hospital burn unit and an additional 4 years in physical therapy and rehabilitation. He never was able to return to work. The event was investigated by OSHA.</Para>
                </Footnote>). The third are stages-of-change models developed by Prochaska and DiClemente and their colleagues (1982) in relation to eliminating addictive behaviors such as smoking. The process of behavior change was conceptualized in five sequential stages: Pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. The stages-of-change approach was also applied to many occupational injury prevention programs including studies conducted by the author and his colleagues. DeJoy also noted that all of the models when applied tended to focus on the person, and excluded the influence of the larger system variables. Most studies also were conducted in factories or other workplaces with static as opposed to dynamic work environments, and with long-term as opposed to short-term contingent workers.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A major contribution is DeJoy’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001381">1996</CitationRef>) matrix of self-protective behavior constructs and stages of worker self- protective behavior (p. 69). He suggested that workers often can recognize a hazard and respond with behavior that mitigates the threat. However, a worker’s self-efficacy does not necessarily lead to a safe decision. In the interest of maintaining production, a supervisor may issue an order to a worker to engage in and unsafe action. On other occasions, a contingency may require an immediate action. In such circumstances, the worker may not be able to follow a prescribed safety policy for dealing with a problem. DeJoy’s final factor is the safety climate in which the worker is embedded. Safety climate also can be described by the presence or absence of social capital. When managers do not value and respect workers’ decisions, and when workers are reluctant to disagree with supervisor for fear of being punished, little social capital is present and the supervisors make the decision. This is illustrated in what happened in the Triangle fire and the Lawrence textile mills. DeJoy also notes that even well trained and highly motivated workers often will not respond appropriately to workplace injury threats if their actions are not valued, recognized and reinforced by managers. He states that safe workplaces depend on collective control, a set of group norms or beliefs shared by workers, managers, and supervisors. He also notes that these group norms are similar to Zohar’s safety climate construct (DeJoy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001381">1996</CitationRef>, p. 67). On page 67 DeJoy et al. have this to say about safety climate.

                  <Para TextBreak="No">…safety climate serves as a frame of reference for guiding relevant behavior in the workplace and that employees develop reasonable expectations regarding behavior-outcome contingencies in their environment…. It follows that collective control or safety climate should be an important consideration in fostering long-term and broad based adherence to safe work practices.</Para>

              </Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A 2009 meta-analysis study examined workplace safety with respect to the roles of person and situation factors (Christin, Bradley, Wallace, &amp; Burke, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00139">2009</CitationRef>). The work was based in part on an earlier study by Clarke (2006) that found safety climate predicts worker safety performance behavior, but is only weakly related to workplace injury events. Christin and his colleagues conducted a literature review of journal articles dealing with prediction of worker safety performance and injuries. They identified 90 studies and 1,744 effect sizes. Of those, 477 were used in a predictor-criterion path analysis model. Safety climate was significantly related to worker safety motivation which, in turn, was significantly related to worker safety knowledge that, in turn, was significantly related to safety performance and this entire path to lower injury rates.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Contingent workers are typically not included in the larger workplace shared safety community norms and practice of the companies for which they work. This is especially true for workers involved in dirty, dangerous, and difficult work that frequently involves temporary, unskilled, under educated, and often non-English speaking workers. The OSHA General Duty Clause and contract worker laws require employers to be responsible for contract workers’ safety training and supervision across the hierarch from employer, to prime contractor, to subcontractor, and sub-subcontractors. The reality is that these workers frequently are excluded from safety training, safety supervision, access to safety equipment, and worker’s compensation insurance. The plights of the miners, shirtwaist factory and textile workers in the early 1900s were ignored for many years. Those “invisible” workers were the ones at greatest risk for occupational illness and injury.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Unfortunately, this past history is being repeated in this twenty-first century. A new and also largely invisible population suffers the same plights and an excessive burden of occupational illness and injury. Not all such at-risk workers are within the United States. Many more are found in the sweatshops and dangerous workplaces in other countries, to which much tedious and dangerous work is outsourced. Yet, there is hope and the potential for lowering the very high injury rates among contingent workers. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00132">13.2</InternalRef> reveals a huge drop in workplace disasters in coal mines and loss of life over the period from 1900 to 2006. The reduction in fatalities may be attributed to three factors. First, early coal mine immigrants became integrated into American society and, along with that, became more informed and empowered. Second, technology not only made coal mining easier and more profitable, but also safer. Third, as the dangerous conditions under which miners worked became widely known, coal mine health and safety laws were passed and enforced. All three played a major role in the reduction of workplace injuries. Similar patterns occurred not only in textile mills, but at foundries, railways, smelters, construction sites and scores of other workplaces. The images in Figs. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00134">13.4</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Fig00135">13.5</InternalRef> reveal much about working conditions in the early 1900s. Nevertheless, at the present time, much remains to be done and many partners need to be involved, including poets, film makers, reporters, artists, unions, professional organizations, business, newspapers, researchers, teachers, health-service providers, attorneys, local officials, trade organizations, state and federal legislators, and regulatory agencies, among others (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00135">13.5</InternalRef>).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00134">
