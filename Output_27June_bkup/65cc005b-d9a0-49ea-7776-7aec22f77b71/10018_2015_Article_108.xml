g the decentralized economy model with a parallel use of two types of energy, we find that the decentralized economy cannot attain the social optimum due to externality in the market economy. Using optimal tax to attain the social optimum in the decentralized economy entails imposing it on the nonrenewable energy sector. Using damage functions for simulation in our model, we find that the worse the environmental damage is, the larger the cost.</Para>

              <Para>A trade-off exists between addressing climate change and economic growth. Fossil fuel fueled economic growth during the industrial revolution, and it will remain a key energy source in the future (IEA <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2013</CitationRef>). However, rising greenhouse gas concentrations are likely the reason behind the increase in temperatures over the last 50 years (IPCC <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2013</CitationRef>), and almost all greenhouse gas emissions are CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> from fossil fuel combustion. Such an antinomic relationship produces anxiety in policy makers about how to ensure economic growth while combatting climate change. Therefore, it is essential that policy makers develop measures to attain economic growth while mitigating climate change.</Para>
              <Para>Several nations have attempted to implement a policy mix of decreasing fossil fuel consumption while increasing renewable energy. The European Union enforced one example of this policy mix in the legislation for its climate energy package. Promoting renewable energy can spur economic growth and provide mitigation, for example, offering financial support. Climate policies can increase economic output both directly and indirectly (Hallegatte et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2012</CitationRef>). Considering the environment to be productive capital, an increase in environmental input through environmental policy leads to economic output. Previously, researchers have noted that correcting market failures resulting from policy indirectly increase economic output.<Footnote ID="Fn1">
                  <Para>Hallegatte et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2012</CitationRef>) highlighted the four channels through which environmental policies can theoretically increase economic output: input effect, efficiency effect, stimulus effect, and innovation effect. The policy mix is closely related to these channels, and we pay special attention to the input effect. That is, we analyze the relationship between economic growth and the shift of energy usage to renewable energy from fossil fuel use.</Para>
                </Footnote>
                     </Para>
              <Para>By promoting renewable energy as a mitigation policy, furtherance is an effective mitigation policy, at least in the short run. This short-run success occurs because renewable energy technology is already available and is economically efficient compared to other zero emissions energy or technologies (see IPCC <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2011</CitationRef>). In addition, enforcing incentive-based policies contributes to the promotion of renewable energy as well as to the abatement of CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> emissions. This policy includes a tax on fossil fuel and the auction of emissions allowances. This is a typical mitigation policy that involves a policy mix. This type of policy raises the revenue needed to support the usage of renewable energy.</Para>
              <Para>Previous studies have addressed economic growth in the context of environmental and resource economics. These studies are broadly classified into two categories: one category investigates an exhaustible energy resource stock where the stock decreases as fossil fuel is consumed (e.g., Hotelling <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">1931</CitationRef>; Barrett <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">1992</CitationRef>), and the other category captures the dynamics of a pollution stock where the stocks increase as pollutants are used (e.g., Gradus and Smulders <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">1993</CitationRef>; Stokey <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">1998</CitationRef>). In particular, Tahvonen and Kuuluvainen (<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">1993</CitationRef>) analyzed economic growth using stock pollution and renewable resources, the latter of which are described as a smooth substitution for emissions.</Para>
              <Para>Previous studies have largely failed to analyze climate policy by considering the relationship between economic growth and the implementation of a policy mix. This is because most studies have focused on one type of resource input even though it is crucial to describe the simultaneous use of nonrenewable and renewable energy. Our challenge in this paper is to examine how economic growth is attained under the simultaneous use of two energy inputs.</Para>
              <Para>The main purpose of our paper is to consider an optimal growth model with a stock of nonrenewable energy using a decentralized and competitive framework. In particular, we analyze the substitutable inputs of nonrenewable and renewable energy following Tahvonen and Salo (<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2001</CitationRef>). This model contrasts with other economic growth-resource depletion models in which only one type of energy contributes to production over time, even after considering a backstop technology (see Dasgupta and Heal <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">1974</CitationRef>). Our model intends to reflect recent trends in which nonrenewable energy consumption decreases with increasing renewable energy in a phased manner.</Para>
              <Para>Several papers study dynamic economic models focusing on policy instruments, which are closely related to our interest. de Miguel and Manzano (<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2006</CitationRef>) modeled a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of a small open economy to import oil and analyzed an oil tax without an exhaustible energy resource stock. The authors found that the distortions of oil prices caused by taxes do not lead to an optimal allocation. Belgodere (<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2009</CitationRef>) considered the optimal climate policy in the presence of oil rents. He showed that a per-unit tax is the policy instrument that obtains the optimal allocation for the provisory decentralized economy model. Fischer and Springborn (<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2011</CitationRef>) analyzed the short-term impact of taxes, emissions caps, and intensity targets on economic growth.</Para>
              <Para>There are only a few studies that assess a policy mix in the context of economic growth. Golosov et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2009</CitationRef>) analyzed the neoclassical growth model, and Golosov et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2014</CitationRef>) consequently applied a DSGE model. These works analyzed an externality of the climate change problem using fossil energy as an input to the production function. However, there is only a fossil fuel input for producing the final goods. Acemoglu et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2012</CitationRef>) analyzed an endogenous and directed technical change in a growth model with environmental constraints, focusing on environmental policy and research subsidies.</Para>
              <Para>Chakravorty et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2006</CitationRef>) showed that both the low-cost nonrenewable resource and the high-cost renewable resource were used jointly under the binding of the stock of emissions. They showed that supplementing the energy supply through clean renewable resources meets the environmental standard when energy demand declines in the long run. Moreover, energy demand returns to dirty fossil fuels in the future when the ceiling becomes non-binding.</Para>
              <Para>van der Ploeg and Withagen (<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2012</CitationRef>) analyzed optimal climate policy in the presence of exhaustible oil, abundant coal, and CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> concentration in the atmosphere. They considered three regimes: only oil use, only coal use, and combining the use of oil and coal. They showed the regime switch of fossil fuel use; the oil-only phase is followed by an oil/coal phase in the social optimum until oil reserves are fully exhausted, at which point the economy switches to coal.</Para>
              <Para>Our paper is more closely related to van der Ploeg and Withagen (<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2010</CitationRef>). They followed Golosov et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2014</CitationRef>) and developed a Green Ramsey model with different regimes of energy use. Their framework for incubating different regimes is consistent with Tahvonen and Salo (<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2001</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para>We consider the decentralized economy adhering fundamentally to Tahvonen and Salo (<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2001</CitationRef>), but our paper differs from them in that externalities and policy are included in our model. Externalities come from a monopoly of renewable energy production and environmental damage. Many previous studies have analyzed the relationship between environmental policy and an incentive of R&amp;D to reduce environmental pollution. Fischer et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2003</CitationRef>) studied the effects of economic incentives to reduce emissions considering technological innovation. Moreover, a polluting firm that invests in environmental R&amp;D affects its strategic position as well as slashes its emissions reduction costs (Montero <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2002a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">b</CitationRef>). This suggests that there is an interaction between environmental policy and environmental R&amp;D. In our model, renewable energy is the only technology that reduces environmental pollution by indirectly shifting from nonrenewable energy. Additionally, the energy monopoly is introduced as a character of the structure of actual market.</Para>
              <Para>The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section <InternalRef RefID="Sec2">2</InternalRef> introduces our analytical framework. Section <InternalRef RefID="Sec9">3</InternalRef> considers the optimal tax, which can be derived by comparing the decentralized economy problem with the social planter problem.

This conclusion is derived from the Hotelling rule with the extraction cost depending on the stock of nonrenewable energy. The stock at steady state remains finite in this case. The reason for this is that a certain amount of the stock is required to dig an oilfield. Thus, <InlineEquation ID="IEq84">

                <Para>There are externalities in the decentralized economy in the previous section, and we consider how to address them. The social planner can attain the optimal allocation. However, the market economy creates inefficiency, which is due to externalities.</Para>
                <Para>We introduce the government, which makes the market economy efficient, and assume that the government realizes the optimum social outcome using a policy measure. Such a policy entails removing supply shortages of renewable energy by monopolists and adding to the social cost of the environmental damage. We consider the tax and subsidy as the policy and assume that the government may finance a source of the subsidy with tax revenues.</Para>
                <Para>As in Xepapadeas (<CitationRef CitationID="CR27">2005</CitationRef>), we assume that tax to create the optimal conditions associated with a market economy is in line with that of the social planner. In the two cases, such a different optimal condition is related to the Hotelling rule. The rule of the market economy is derived from the behaviors of final goods producers and nonrenewable energy producers. From the optimal conditions of the final goods sector (see Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec4">2.2.1</InternalRef>), it is apparent that the tax on the nonrenewable energy use of the final goods producer cannot achieve an alignment of the optimal conditions of the social planner and the market economy.</Para>
                <Para>We focus on the tax levied on the nonrenewable energy sector, and introduce a profit tax <InlineEquation ID="IEq107">

Compared to Eqs. (<InternalRef RefID="Equ2">2</InternalRef>) and (<InternalRef RefID="Equ4">4</InternalRef>), the profit tax term of Eq. (<InternalRef RefID="Equ4">4</InternalRef>) corresponds to the marginal damage term of Eq. (<InternalRef RefID="Equ2">2</InternalRef>). Implementing the social planner solution using the profit tax in the market economy, the time variation of profit tax is equal to the ratio of the marginal environmental damage to the net royalty from the sale of nonrenewable energy, which means <InlineEquation ID="IEq111">

Such a condition is obtained from the optimal condition of renewable sector and Eq. (<InternalRef RefID="Equ8">8</InternalRef>). The renewable sector in the market economy is assumed to be a monopolist supply, which raises less production compared to perfect competition. The renewable resource price exceeds a marginal cost of the renewable resource by the rate of a reciprocal of the price elasticity of demand in the monopoly market. In this case, the subsidy is introduced to support the excess and is denoted by <InlineEquation ID="IEq112">

When the optimal tax on the profits of the nonrenewable energy sector is imposed and the budget of the government is balanced, a solution of the decentralized economy is consistent with one of the social planner problems. In this context, we investigate a comparison between tax and no tax.</Para>

                <Para>We obtain damage loss functions from the nonrenewable energy stock and damage loss up to 2050. Future damage is derived from the results of the Stern review, where 5 % of global GDP is lost each year without climate action. Hence we set two cases: damage loss at 5 % of annual global GDP and damage loss at 1 % of annual whole GDP. We estimate the function using calculated GDP loss. The functions are as follows:<Equation ID="Equ5">

                  <Para>We illustrate the simulation results using the calculated damage loss functions in the Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec14">4.2</InternalRef>. We set three cases in our simulation: market economy, 1 % loss, and 5 % loss. Although there is no consideration in the market economy case of the environmental impact of consuming nonrenewable energy, the 1 % loss case and 5 % loss case introduce the profit tax on the nonrenewable energy sector. We assume that the government is concerned with future environmental damage loss. When the government’s perspective on damage loss is serious, the damage loss function provides higher damage losses. In our model, the higher the damage loss function is, the more rigorous the tax. The term of our simulation is 40 periods (from 2010 up to 2050).</Para>
                  <Para>We develop the decentralized economy model of the Tahvonen and Salo (<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2001</CitationRef>) in order to consider the externalities and policy. The difference between their model and our model is whether to consider the markets, which are product market, exhaustible energy market, and renewable market. This difference enables us to show the extent of the impact of an improvement in the externality on economy. Our simulation results show that the impact in the 1 % case remains very small but 5 % case has the relatively large impact on economy (see the left panel in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">6</InternalRef>). The tax may cause considerable delays of the recovery in consumption under the 5 % case.</Para>
                  <Para>The left panel in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef> represents nonrenewable energy use and the right panel represents renewable resource use. The market economy case shows the highest nonrenewable energy use because no tax is imposed. Nonrenewable energy uses in all three cases decrease over time, but there are no wide gaps among them. Similarly, renewable resource uses in three cases are not found to have a wide gap. Renewable resource use in the 5 % loss case is the highest in the three cases. This is because the profit tax on the nonrenewable energy sector increases the cost of renewable resources and the relative price of renewable resources decreases at the initial period. However, in the aftermath, renewable resource use in the market economy is only slightly higher than in the others cases. Nonrenewable energy use in the market economy case is larger than in the others cases and the speed of depletion is the fastest among the three cases. The most rapid resource scarcity leads to a greater increase in the marginal cost of nonrenewable energy, and an increase in energy prices at equilibrium allows renewable resource use to be extended.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig4">

The 5 % loss case and 1 % loss case take into account that the tax policy is geared toward conserving nonrenewable energy and that the stock of the two cases is higher than the stock in market economy case.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig5">

Production in the market economy case is the highest over time among the three cases. Productions decrease from the initial period to approximately the fifth period and increases after that. A decrease of the productions is derived from a late development capital stock and renewable resource use as substitution of nonrenewable energy use. Consumption in the market economy case is the highest among the three cases. In the model, the rent of the nonrenewable energy sector is received by the household. Therefore, the optimal tax leads to a decrease in consumption.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig6">

                  <Para>The introduction of the tax on the nonrenewable energy sector leads to the reduction of nonrenewable energy use and an acceleration of renewable energy use, but the acceleration is not enough to keep the pre-tax level of production (see the left panel in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">6</InternalRef>), because the marginal cost of renewable energy is high as renewable energy use increases (see Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec4">2.1.1</InternalRef>). It can be observed that the high cost of renewable energy prohibits the progress of the renewable energy use in the actual energy markets.</Para>
                  <Para>The capital stock which is another substitutable producer good for nonrenewable energy increases despite the relatively high discount rate in our simulation. One possible explanation for why the increases of capital stock has a consumer sentiment to hope saving relative to current consuming throughout the decrease of nonrenewable energy use according to the Hotelling rule [see the Eq. (<InternalRef RefID="Equ2">2</InternalRef>)]. The stock of capital and acknowledge related to renewable energy tends to increase in the world, and a reduction of nonrenewable energy use is an effective way to accumulate the stock further.</Para>
                  <Para>Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab4">4</InternalRef> summarizes the damage loss in the market economy case. The stock of nonrenewable energy leads to 21T-CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> at the 40th period. When the damage loss in the future follows Eq. (<InternalRef RefID="Equ5">5</InternalRef>), the loss is estimated at approximately $1,797 billion.

                  <Para>Renewable energy and capital stock are substitutable producer goods in our model, and the substitution accelerates by means of the tax on nonrenewable energy sector. Our simulation shows the new paths of the steady states which are created by the tax. This substitution depicts the penetration of the renewable energy technology in the real economy. The cost function of renewable energy under the assumption can be regarded as the cost curve to arrange the price of the renewable energy technologies in descending order (see Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec4">2.1.1</InternalRef>). The penetration of renewable energy needs not only the decrease in its own cost but also the adequate price level of nonrenewable energy in order to remain that renewable energy can be contestable in the energy markets. If an excessive price reduction of nonrenewable energy disturbs the penetration of renewable energy in the energy market, the tax to keep the adequate nonrenewable energy price is supportive from a standpoint of the effective penetration.</Para>
                  <Para>In addition, it is important to attain the economic growth under the environmental regulations. Our simulation results show the growth after the introduction of the tax (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">6</InternalRef>), but it is found that consumption recovers to the pre-tax level in slow motion. If the recovery of economy is very low-speed and the slowness conducive to the large damage of the economy, it is also necessary that the government implement the subsidy policy to recover consumption fast as well as the environmental regulation, because the social welfare enhancing comes from the greener environment with lower economic damage.</Para>

              <Para>A current major policy combines a climate policy and a renewable energy policy. We study this policy by applying the optimal growth model to an environmental externality and a monopoly of renewable energy production. We show that levying a tax on the nonrenewable energy resources sector and awarding a subsidy for renewable energy use achieves the social optimum.</Para>
              <Para>Our findings are as follows. A decentralized economy cannot attain the social optimum. Comparing the optimal conditions of the decentralized economy to the social planner’s problem, we find that imposing an optimal tax on a nonrenewable energy producer coincides with both conditions. A lump-sum transfer of the tax to a renewable energy use causes renewable energy to increase more than in the case without the tax. However, our simulation shows an inversion of magnitudes between the cases with and without taxes on renewable energy. This is because higher energy prices resulting from the scarcity of nonrenewable energy promote the use of renewable energy.</Para>
              <Para>Other simulation results show the social losses under the damage functions. In our model, a social expense depends on the magnitude of social damage to the environment. A social loss in the 1 % loss case costs $1.8 trillion, and a social loss in the 5 % loss case costs $5.6 trillion. We show that consumption and production are the lowest in the 5 % loss case. This case has the highest amount of social damage.</Para>
              <Para>In particular, we consider the monopoly of renewable energy production. This is one of the externalities in our model. The monopoly causes less supply of renewable energy, and constitutes barriers to the mitigation of climate change and to economic growth. We do not sufficiently examine the renewable energy market, but it is possible for the high-tech and major-scale renewable energy source industry to have a large fixed cost.</Para>
              <Para>Our paper demonstrates a policy assessment using two types of energy. Several directions appear fruitful for future research. First, developing our model and an endogenous economic growth model would be useful because the economy is growing under a nonrenewable energy constraint. Second, pollution from the combustion of nonrenewable energy can be taken into account. The externality of pollution is different over nonrenewable energy. Thus, the results of this paper may provide different implications. Finally, we implicitly assume a closed economy. It is important to consider a global economy with a tax and a climate fund.</Para>
