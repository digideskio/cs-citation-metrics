              <Para TextBreak="No">Substance use has been observed throughout history and remains an urgent public health concern in many countries. In the United States alone, the cost of alcohol and other drug use is estimated to be greater than $240 billion per year (Martin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001043">2001</CitationRef>). According to Janikowski, Cardoso, and Lee (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001031">2005</CitationRef>), substance use is defined as experimental or casual consumption in which the individual exercises little control, whereas substance abuse is the maladaptive pattern of substance use, including excessive use, compulsions to use, and continued use despite negative consequences. Excessive and prolonged use of substances may result in addiction. Substance dependence is the compulsive use of a substance accompanied by increasing amounts needed to achieve the desired effect, despite negative ­consequences. Substance abuse and dependence are major national health crises with wide-ranging consequences (Benshoff &amp; Janikowski, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00103">2000</CitationRef>; Janikowski et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001031">2005</CitationRef>). Substance abuse and addiction dominate the individual’s life, creating problems across the spectrum of physical, psychological, and social functioning (Janikowski et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001031">2005</CitationRef>). The prevalence rates for illicit drug use, marijuana use, and nonmedical use of a psychotherapeutic drug in the United States are reported to be 8.7, 6.6, and 2.8% respectively (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], <CitationRef CitationID="CR001056">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Both in terms of the general population and people with co-occurring disabilities, substance use significantly impacts life functioning, including employment. Contrary to popular belief, most people who use alcohol or illicit drugs are employed. Illicit drug use (i.e., nonmedical use of cannabis, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription medication) differs based on employment status. Of the estimated 19.3 million current illicit drug users, including adults aged 18 or older, 12.9 million (66.6%) are employed either full or part time. Alcohol use also differs based on employment status, such that adults employed full-time (63.9%) are more likely to use alcohol than unemployed adults (58.3%). Furthermore, among 57.4 million adult binge drinkers, 74.4% are employed either full or part time, and among the 16.6 million heavy drinkers in the USA, 74.9% are employed (SAMHSA, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001056">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">While it is certainly conceivable that substance use affects workplace performance, the ­bidirectional relationship between the workplace factors and substance use points to the workplace as an environmental risk factor for substance use. Substance use impairs alertness and reflexes, interferes with accuracy and efficiency, raising the likelihood of serious accidents (Canadian Center for Occupational Health and Safety, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001010">2008</CitationRef>). Substance use may also increase absenteeism, affect job performance, and reduce overall productivity. Substance abuse and addiction pose significant treatment challenges for rehabilitation, public health, and occupational health professionals. Theories have been proposed to explain the occurrence and maintenance of addiction in the workplace in spite of its overwhelming negative outcomes. One theory that attempts to explain the phenomenon of substance use is the ­self-medication hypothesis of substance use (Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001035">1999</CitationRef>; Khantzian, Mack, &amp; Schatzberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001037">1974</CitationRef>), and it may be useful for ­understanding substance use in the workplace.</Para>

              <Heading>Self-medication Hypothesis of Alcohol or Illicit Drug Use</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Self-medication is a term used to describe the self-soothing use of substances to treat untreated or undiagnosed mental distress, mental illnesses, and/or psychosocial trauma. Self-medication theory was initially based on research specific to heroin use (Khantzian et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001037">1974</CitationRef>), and was later used to examine properties of cocaine, alcohol, and other substances (Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001033">1985</CitationRef>). Despite its early roots in psychodynamic theory, the self-medication hypothesis was further explored through the “lens” of behavior theory, with emphases on positive reinforcement and operant conditioning. In recent years, the original self-medication hypothesis has been updated to reflect a more integrated model of self-medication.</Para>

                <Heading>Psychodynamic Model</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Originating from research conducted by Khantzian et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001037">1974</CitationRef>), the self-medication hypothesis asserts that substance abuse serves a compensatory function by modulating and soothing the self from unmanageable or distressful psychological states. From a psychodynamic perspective, Khantzian (1977) theorized that drug users compensate for deficient ego function through drug use, in which the drug or “ego solvent” acts on parts of the unconscious self that are blocked by defense mechanisms (Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001034">1997</CitationRef>). It is hypothesized that drug users experience greater psychiatric distress than ­nonusers, and substance dependence evolves from the gradual incorporation of the drug effects into the defensive activities of the ego. An individual’s choice of drug is based on the interaction of the psychopharmacological properties of the substance and the affective state from which the individual is seeking relief. Therefore, the drug’s effects replace the maladaptive or nonexistent ego mechanisms of defense, and the choice of drugs is random (Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001033">1985</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Behaviorist Model</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Despite its psychodynamic roots, the self-medication hypothesis was also interpreted using a behavioral paradigm proposed by Duncan (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001016">1975</CitationRef>). Using the behavioral perspective, Duncan described the nature of positive reinforcement (e.g., presence of pleasant sensation), negative reinforcement (e.g., reduction in negative affective states), and avoidance of withdrawal symptoms as the underlying factors of problematic drug use. Duncan’s interpretation of the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Self-medication Hypothesis</Emphasis> was a departure from ­previous behavioral theory in which drug dependence occurred through operant conditioning, and requires both positive and negative forms of reinforcement. Conversely, Duncan posited that only negative reinforcement was required for drug dependence in that drug dependence is an avoidance behavior providing temporary respite from a problem. Therefore, the use of a substance is an operant behavior generated through positive reinforcement (Duncan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001015">1974</CitationRef>). The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Self-medication Hypothesis</Emphasis> demonstrated its adaptability to multiple levels of influence in Duncan’s public health model of drug ­dependence, in which the agent (drug of choice) infects the host (drug user) through a vector (e.g., peers), while the environment supports the disease through stressors and lack of support (Duncan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001016">1975</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">In recent years, Khantzian revised the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Self-medication Hypothesis</Emphasis> (the Updated Theory) to consider the affective, behavioral, and cognitive components of self-medication (Khantzian &amp; Albanese, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001036">2008</CitationRef>). Although concepts of dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal derived from biological models have greatly contributed to our understanding of addiction, biological models are unable to account for factors that lead to relapse after years of sobriety (Khantzian &amp; Albanese, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001036">2008</CitationRef>). In updating the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Self-medication Hypothesis</Emphasis>, Khantzian and Albanese (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001036">2008</CitationRef>) clarify that the self-medication hypothesis is intended only to complement current models of addiction, and it does not represent a substitute for biopsychosocial models of addiction (Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001034">1997</CitationRef>). Again, the original <Emphasis Type="Italic">Self-medication Hypothesis</Emphasis> posits that an individual uses drugs or alcohol in order regulate emotional processes and achieve ­stability (Suh, Ruffins, Robins, Albanese, &amp; Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001057">2008</CitationRef>), whereas Khantzian’s Updated Theory identifies the individual’s <Emphasis Type="Italic">inability to cope with strong emotions</Emphasis> as the primary motivator for substance use (Hall &amp; Queener, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001027">2007</CitationRef>). This updated <Emphasis Type="Italic">Self-medication Hypothesis</Emphasis> has two essential ­components related to the cause and specificity of addiction.

                      <Para TextBreak="No">The first component posits that addiction is caused by the impact of the drug of choice on alleviating psychological distress. Distress occurs because people are unable to regulate their emotions, sense of self-worth, relationships, or behavior (Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001033">1985</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001035">1999</CitationRef>; Khantzian &amp; Albanese, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001036">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>

In other words, the selected drug of choice is not random, because the individual bases his or her selection on the impact of a certain drug on his or her affective state (Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001033">1985</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001035">1999</CitationRef>). Therefore, the individual’s drug of choice represents an external mechanism for modifying his or her emotions (Hall &amp; Queener, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001027">2007</CitationRef>; Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001033">1985</CitationRef>; Suh et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001057">2008</CitationRef>). For example, alcohol and sedative drugs may relieve feelings of depression and anxiety (Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001034">1997</CitationRef>), opiates are hypothesized to be used as a self-medication for aggression and rage (Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001035">1999</CitationRef>), and psychostimulants are used by individuals who experience depression in order to reduce anhedonia and increase self-esteem (Khantzian &amp; Albanese, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001036">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Empirical Evidence</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In order to test the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Self-medication Hypothesis</Emphasis>, mental health symptoms that pre-date the onset of substance-use disorders are considered evidence of self-medication. However, empirical evidence supporting the self-medication hypothesis in the clinical and epidemiological literature is less than unequivocal. Kessler et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001032">1996</CitationRef>) reported that 51% of the participants in the National Comorbidity Study who met criteria for a substance disorder at some time in their life also met criteria for a mental disorder at some point, and in the large majority of cases, individuals reported that the mental disorder preceded the substance disorder. Using a retrospective study design, Suh et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001057">2008</CitationRef>) used six <Emphasis Type="Italic">Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2</Emphasis> (<Emphasis Type="Italic">MMPI-2</Emphasis>) special scales (Repression, Overcontrolled Hostility, Psychomotor Acceleration, Depression, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and Cynicism scales) as independent variables to predict drug use in a large sample of drug users and non-drug users (<Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis>  =  402). Logistic regression predicted three models defined by “drug of choice.” Repression and, inversely, Depression scales significantly predicted the alcohol group. Psychomotor Acceleration was the only significant predictor of the cocaine group. Cynicism significantly predicted the heroin group. The results partially confirmed Khantzian’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001034">1997</CitationRef>) clinical observations and demonstrated the relationship between psychological traits and drug of choice. The clinical implications of the findings highlight the relevance of psychodynamic perspectives in understanding drug addiction. The authors note that, in advancing the constructs of the self-medication hypothesis, it will be important to develop assessment tools providing a valid measure of the affective experience specified by the self-­medication theory (Suh et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001057">2008</CitationRef>). Bolton, Cox, Clara, and Sareen (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00106">2006</CitationRef>) conducted a study of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Self-medication Hypothesis</Emphasis> using a nationally representative sample, and also reported that self-medication is a common occurrence amongst persons diagnosed with anxiety disorders.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Potvin, Sepehry, and Stip (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001051">2006</CitationRef>) conducted a meta-analysis based on 11 studies (<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>  =  11; <Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis>  =  1,135) to test the self-medication hypothesis in patients with a dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and a substance-abuse disorder, predicated on the assumption that individuals with schizophrenia use psychoactive substances to seek relief from negative symptoms. These investigators found a moderate effect size (Hedges’ <Emphasis Type="Italic">g</Emphasis>  =  −0.47, <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis>  &lt;  0.001), indicating that patients dually diagnosed with schizophrenia and a substance-use disorder experience fewer negative symptoms. The results suggest either substance abuse relieves the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, or patients with fewer negative symptoms would be more prone to substance-use disorders. However, a number of research design problems plagued the various retrospective studies. Specifically, these studies tended to use highly selected samples of patients with advanced substance-use disorders who may have had problems accurately recalling the temporal sequence of the onset of mental health symptoms and substance-use disorders.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">More recently, Fergusson, Boden, and Horwood (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001019">2009</CitationRef>) conducted a prospective study using a longitudinal birth cohort with three repeated measurements, at ages 18, 21, and 25 years, in order to examine causal links between alcohol abuse or dependence and major depression, using structural equation modeling as the method of analysis. These researchers controlled for confounding factors, and the results suggested three possibilities: (a) alcohol abuse caused depression; (b) depression caused alcohol abuse; or (c) alcohol abuse and depression share a reciprocal, causal relationship. However, the structural model with causal pathways leading from alcohol abuse to depression provided a better fit to the data than either alternative models (i.e., the depression led to alcohol abuse model or the reciprocal model). Therefore, Fergusson et al. concluded that while alcohol abuse played a causal role in increasing risks of depression, depression did not necessarily cause alcohol abuse. Similarly, Hall and Queener (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001027">2007</CitationRef>) assessed anxiety, depression, hostility, and alexithymia levels in 70 methadone maintenance treatment patients to test Khantzian’s Updated Theory, and they were unable to establish a causal link between negative affective states and substance use. They concluded that evidence does not support the hypothesized causal relationship between negative and ambiguous affective states and substance use.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Finally, Boden and Fergusson (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00105">2011</CitationRef>) conducted a meta-analytic study to examine the associations between alcohol use disorders and major depression, and to also evaluate the evidence for the existence of a causal relationship between the disorders. Specifically, the study examined the potential causal relationships that may be present in the association between alcohol use disorders and major depression: (a) alcohol use disorders causes major depression; (b) major depression causes alcohol use disorders (i.e., the “self-medication” hypothesis); and (c) a reciprocal causal relationship exists between alcohol use disorders and major depression, such that each disorder increases the risk of the other disorder simultaneously. The authors found that the presence of either disorder doubled the risks of the second disorder, with pooled adjusted odds ratios ranging from 2.00 to 2.09. Importantly, the data supported a causal linkage between alcohol use disorders and major depression, such that increasing involvement with alcohol increases risk of depression and not vice versa. Because a number of studies have shown that treatment of alcohol use disorders results in a reduction of major depression symptoms, Boden and Fergusson recommend that treatment of major depression should include assessment and treatment of alcohol use disorders. Conversely, for individuals who reported using alcohol to self-medicate symptoms of depression, a combination of treatments for alcohol use ­disorders and major depression may be warranted.</Para>

              <Heading>The Work-Stress Paradigm of Self-medication</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">As mentioned earlier, substance use can affect the workplace. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Self-medication Hypothesis</Emphasis> ­suggests that people use alcohol or illicit drugs to cope with untreated or undiagnosed mental distress and drug use behavior may continue into the workplace, thus affecting work performance. However, with globalization, business organizations are placing a strong emphasis on maximizing productivity and efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing product quality to remain competitive in a global market, leading to increasingly stressful work environments (Noonan &amp; Wagner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001049">2010</CitationRef>). In the context of work, stress can be defined as physical and psychosocial response that occurs when the requirements and/or conditions of the workplace are not aligned with the worker’s capabilities, resources, or needs (National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001047">1999</CitationRef>). From the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Self-medication Hypothesis</Emphasis> perspective, a stressful workplace may cause psychosocial distress which, in turn, leads to alcohol or illicit drug use, particularly for individuals with problems regulating negative emotions.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Frone (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001022">1999</CitationRef>) reviewed four basic work-stress paradigm models to examine the relationship between work stress and alcohol use, although these models may be adapted and applied to other substances as well. The models include the (a) simple cause–effect model, (b) meditation model, (c) moderation model, and (d) moderated mediation model. In the simple cause and effect model, there is a simple direct relationship between work stress and substance use, with mixed empirical findings. This model is limited because of the simple premise that work stressors may cause substance use without the influence of intervening variables.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In the mediation model, variables are proposed to link work stressors and substance use, including job dissatisfaction, negative affect, and coping strategies. This model is useful because it attempts to explain the underlying mechanism by which work stressors relate to substance use. According to Frone (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001022">1999</CitationRef>), empirical support for this model of employee alcohol use indicated the relationship between certain work stressors and alcohol use, and that they are also mediated by anxiety level (Vasse, Nijhuis, &amp; Kok, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001060">1998</CitationRef>), negative affect (Martin, Roman, &amp; Blum, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001045">1996</CitationRef>), and job dissatisfaction (Greenberg &amp; Grunberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001024">1995</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In the moderation model, work stressors interact with other variables that inhibit or facilitate ­substance use among employees. In other words, the relationship between alcohol use and work stressors differs as a function of the moderating variable(s). Frone (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001022">1999</CitationRef>) cites empirical evidence for the following moderators leading to increased alcohol use: (a) high psychological importance of work to self-definition (Frone, Russell, &amp; Cooer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001023">1997</CitationRef>), (b) alcohol use as a coping strategy to relax and forget about problems (Grunberg, Moore, Anderson-Connolly, &amp; Greenberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001025">1999</CitationRef>), and (c) traditional gender-role attitudes for women and egalitarian gender-roles for men (Parker &amp; Harford, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001050">1992</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In the moderated meditation model, there is an explanation of how and when work stressors impact substance use. This model is based on the assumption that work stressors are positively related to job dissatisfaction, which is positively related to alcohol use in persons who are vulnerable to relapse (Cooper, Russell, &amp; Frone, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001014">1990</CitationRef>; Grunberg, Moore, &amp; Greenberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001026">1998</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Frone (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001022">1999</CitationRef>) proposed a conceptual model entitled the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Work-Stress Paradigm</Emphasis>, which theorized that risky health behavior, such as substance use, occurs because of aversive work conditions, heavy work load, job insecurity, alienation, interpersonal conflict with fellow employees and/or supervisors, and unfair processes regarding pay, benefits, and promotion. Importantly, work alienation, which has ­typically been studied as a paradigm apart from work stress (Trice &amp; Sonnenstuhl, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001059">1990</CitationRef>), relates to work characteristics that lead to job dissatisfaction, including minimally skilled jobs and employees having little to no control in workplace decision making. Work-related stressors also occur when work-related demands interfere with other aspects of life, specifically work–family conflict (Frone, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001022">1999</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In addition to the inability to manage work-related stress with appropriate regulation of negative emotions, lacking a repertoire of positive coping responses may also lead to alcohol or illicit drug use in the workplace. Bandura’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00102">1969</CitationRef>) coping deficits model of alcohol use proposed that persons consumed alcohol to reduce stress because alternative coping skills were not available (Colder, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001012">2001</CitationRef>). Considering the limitations of applying coping models in examining work stress and substance use among employees, Grunberg et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001026">1998</CitationRef>) present a modified model linking specific job stressors (changes in benefits, conditions, skills, and/or safety; work demands, job insecurity, criticism, support, and feeling stuck) to alcohol use (heavy drinking and negative consequences), while job satisfaction and coping reasons for drinking mediate the relationship. They found that coping reasons for drinking were significantly associated with heavy alcohol use (<Emphasis Type="Italic">r</Emphasis>  =  0.29) and negative consequences to drinking (<Emphasis Type="Italic">r</Emphasis>  =  0.50).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Another model related to adverse coping mechanisms in the workforce is the spillover or generalization model (Cooper, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001013">1983</CitationRef>; Martin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001042">1990</CitationRef>; Martin, Blum, &amp; Roman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001044">1992</CitationRef>), which contends that “individuals do not or cannot compartmentalize their lives; that negative characteristics of jobs not only create stressful emotional, mental, and physical states within the worker, but also that such stressful conditions will extend beyond the workday into the individual’s non-work life” and “negative or stressful job characteristics might result in both negative work and non-work outcomes” (Grunberg et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001026">1998</CitationRef>, p. 487). Rather than utilizing positive coping strategies (e.g., exercise, hobbies, etc.), substance use becomes the primary coping mechanism for stress. According to the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Self-medication Hypothesis</Emphasis>, people use alcohol or illicit drugs to self-soothe from unmanageable or distressful psychological states. However, these problems in self-regulation interact with personal characteristics, genetic vulnerability, and the environment to facilitate addiction.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Due to the workplace being the primary social atmosphere in which most employed people spend a large majority of time, understanding substance use within the context of the workplace is distinct and based on the boundaries the environment imposes via workplace rules and/or cultural norms (Ames &amp; Grube, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00101">1997</CitationRef>). Within the cultural paradigm, these rules and/or cultural norms may either facilitate or inhibit substance use (Ames &amp; Grube, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00101">1997</CitationRef>). With regard to alcohol consumption, workplace-drinking groups have served as a group response to certain job conditions such as repetitive tasks, overtime, and shift work (Ames &amp; Grube, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00101">1997</CitationRef>). Furthermore, alcohol use may reflect union solidarity or serve as a celebratory function, such as payday, holiday weekends, or the ending of the workday and/or week (Ames &amp; Grube, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00101">1997</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Within the availability paradigm, social and physical factors of alcoholic substances may explain the difference in alcohol use among employees, as previous research identified availability as an overall correlate of alcohol consumption (Ames &amp; Grube, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00101">1997</CitationRef>). However, few studies examine the role of social and physical availability on work-related alcohol use. Of the few studies focusing on availability, ethnographic studies reveal social and physical availability as a major influence in developing and maintaining patterns and networks in work-related alcohol consumption. The general availability theory suggests the social and physical availability of alcohol increases its use and problems ­associated with usage (Ames &amp; Grube, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00101">1997</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Physical availability is “the extent to which there is access to alcohol in a given environment and to the barriers or costs associated with obtaining it” (Ames &amp; Grube, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00101">1997</CitationRef>, p. 383). Thus, in the work context, physical availability of alcohol can be defined as “the ease or difficulty with which an individual can obtain alcohol for work-related consumption” including “obtaining alcohol on or near the work premises and at work-related events, polices and rules against brining alcohol into a work setting or obtaining it at work, and the degree to which such policies can be enforced” (p. 384). Objective physical availability is defined as “the actual legal, or organizational and geographical factors that affect the costs of acquiring alcohol” (p. 383), and it relates to “the extent to which such elements actually exist in the workplace” (p. 383). Subjective physical availability is defined as “the belief about the ease or difficulty of obtaining alcohol” (p. 383). In the work context, subjective physical availability relates to “perceptions or beliefs about how difficult it is to obtain and consume alcohol in work-related contexts” (p. 384).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Social availability is defined as “the degree of normative support for drinking within one’s social environments” (Ames &amp; Grube, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00101">1997</CitationRef>, p. 383). In the work context, social availability refers to the “normative support for work-related drinking within one’s work environment” including two dimensions: (a) frequency of use among friends and coworkers, and (b) (dis)approval by coworkers and superiors. Objective social availability is defined as the actual drinking and approval of drinking by family, friends, and others, while subjective social availability is defined as perceptions of drinking norms in a given environment (Ames &amp; Grube). In the work context, objective social availability relates to “the actual presence of drinking and approval in the work environment” (p. 384); and subjective social availability relates to the “individual’s perceptions of work-related drinking patterns of his or her coworkers and work friends, and perceptions of the extent to which friends, coworkers and supervisors approve or disapprove of his or her drinking” (p. 384). Therefore, within Frone’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001022">1999</CitationRef>) work-stress paradigm of self-medication in the workplace, the work culture may interact with work stress to affect illicit drug use in the workplace. The physical and social availability variables are therefore important moderator variables between stress and illicit drug use in the workplace.

                <Para TextBreak="No">Wiesner, Windle, and Freeman (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001063">2005</CitationRef>) conducted a cross-sectional study evaluating the relationship between work stress, alcohol and drug use, and depression in a sample of 583 young adult workers. Their findings de-emphasized direct relationships between work stress and drug/alcohol use, and instead emphasized the moderating relationships of job demands and gender. Young adult workers in low skilled variety jobs were 1.85 times more likely to experience depressive symptoms, and were also 2.07 times more likely to be heavy alcohol users (Wiesner et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001063">2005</CitationRef>). The explanation that the inability of young unskilled workers to regulate negative emotions resulting from the stress of monotonous job tasks, thereby leading to substance use, provides support for the work-stress paradigm of self-medication. In terms of moderating effects, there was a significant association between low skill variety jobs and heavy alcohol use by gender such that men were at a 2.81 greater risk to be heavy alcohol users. When considering high workload, men were 6.1 times less likely to be heavy drug users. As a protective factor, persons with a high workload and low intrinsic work motivation were at a 0.61 lower risk for being heavy drug users.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Using interview data from 984 employees of a manufacturing plant, Ames and Grube (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00101">1997</CitationRef>) tested a model that accounted for demographic variables and alcohol use outside of work, in which work-related alcohol consumption increased as a direct increase of (a) subjective physical availability of alcohol at work, (b) perceived approval of alcohol use by others, and (c) perceived alcohol use by others at work. Of the 984 employees, 23% reported drinking at work at least once, and 43% of those reported having two or more drinks. The model was able to predict drinking at work (<Emphasis Type="Italic">R</Emphasis>
                  <Superscript>2</Superscript>  =  0.42) and perceived work-related drinking by others (<Emphasis Type="Italic">R</Emphasis>
                  <Superscript>2</Superscript>  =  0.29). The model accounted for variance caused by several factors, such as (a) drinking before work (21%), (b) subjective physical availability (20%), (c) perceived approval of work-related drinking by others (36%), (d) belief about best friend’s work-related drinking (15%), and the (e) combined demographics of age (younger), religiosity (less), and gender (male), such that younger, less religious men were 20% more likely to use alcohol in the workplace. Testing of the model revealed that the strongest predictor of work-related alcohol use was subjective social availability at work (<Emphasis Type="Italic">R</Emphasis>
                  <Superscript>2</Superscript>  =  0.20), specifically, beliefs about alcohol use among coworkers and other friends at work (<Emphasis Type="Italic">R</Emphasis>

                <Para TextBreak="No">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Self-medication Hypothesis</Emphasis> offers several reasons for alcohol and illicit drug use in the workplace. People with difficulty regulating negative emotions use alcohol or illicit drugs to treat untreated or undiagnosed mental distress, and substance-use behavior may infiltrate the workplace. Similarly, individuals with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, use alcohol or illicit drugs to relieve psychiatric symptoms. Therefore, timely screening and treatment of mental health problems in the workplace may prevent the development of substance-use disorders, particularly among workers vulnerable to mental health problems because of poor ability to regulate negative emotions or a deficiency in positive coping resources and responses (Harris &amp; Edlund, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001028">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Stress Reduction</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Changes in the modern workplace and increasing globalization have led to greater job insecurity, causing the workplace to become an increasingly stressful place. Stress in the workplace can cause significant psychosocial distress, which may lead to alcohol or illicit drug use. Depression is responsible for the largest portions of short- and long-term disability claims (Noonan &amp; Wagner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001049">2010</CitationRef>). Employees receiving treatment for depression are twice as likely to use short-term disability, relative to coworkers who have never been treated for mental health issues. In addition, disability-related costs were $1,038 for workers receiving treatment for depression, but averaged a mere $325 per year for employees not diagnosed and being treated for depression (Birnbaum et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00104">2010</CitationRef>). Therefore, occupational stress management and accommodation for workers experiencing related mental health issues may be necessary in the prevention and management of alcohol and illicit drug use problems in the workplace.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Workplace stress is determined by multiple, interactive factors. Noonan and Wagner (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001049">2010</CitationRef>) identified many major determinants of workplace stress—job control, job strain, job complexity, lack of variety in work, lack of use for employee skills, amount of control/decision latitude, physical work environment, workload and pace, role ambiguity, social support, hours of work, and shift-work. In addition, employees tend to experience high levels of strain when the organization goals are ambiguous and resources are inadequate and inappropriate to meet organization goals (Noonan &amp; Wagner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001049">2010</CitationRef>). Psychosocial adjustment in the workplace may be affected by interactive factors, such as the employees’ tendency to react negatively to stress and the presence of job-specific and organizational level stressors.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">According to Lazarus and Folkman’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001038">1984</CitationRef>) model of stress, appraisal, and coping, coping serves a mediating function between situational appraisals, the person-environmental relationship, and emotional response (Folkman &amp; Lazarus, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001020">1988</CitationRef>). Appraisal represents a two-stage process that consists of primary and secondary appraisals (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001038">1984</CitationRef>). Primary appraisals involve assessing the meaning of an event and determining what is at stake for the individual (Franks &amp; Roesch, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001021">2006</CitationRef>); secondary appraisal involves determining the stressfulness of a situation in terms of the harm/loss, threat, or challenge the situation will produce. The coping process involves a primary appraisal (i.e., whether the event is harmful/loss, a threat, or a challenge), a secondary appraisal (i.e., generating potential responses), and the coping response. Two common dimensions to these models include emotion-focused coping, in which the coping is directed to a person, and problem-focused coping, in which coping is more situation-focused (Endler &amp; Parker, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001018">1990</CitationRef>). Problem-solving coping has been reported to be particularly effective in reducing stress associated with role ambiguity, workload, and lack of resources (Noonan &amp; Wagner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001049">2010</CitationRef>), whereas emotional-coping was found to be a moderator between stress and alcohol use (Veenstra et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001061">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Noonan and Wagner (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001049">2010</CitationRef>) recommended that stress management initiatives should be contextual, considering the needs and sources of stress-related problems at both the individual and organizational level. For example, if it is the work environment that contributes to significant psychosocial strain, then implementing changes to redesign tasks, altering the organizational structure, improving communication, or improving worker autonomy can reduce stress and improve organizational health and the well-being of employees. Health promotion and wellness efforts are directed at reducing the specific sources of stress within the context of the physical, social, and organizational environment (Noblet, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001048">2003</CitationRef>). At the individual level, the goals of stress management interventions can be to improve employee resilience, improve coping abilities, and empower the employee to take more personal control in managing workplace stress by providing employees with training in time management, coping, assertiveness, cognitive restructuring, relaxation, meditation, and physical fitness. Enhancing social support in the workplace is also an important stress-reduction strategy. Companies can help employees reduce occupational stress by helping them develop conflict resolution skills, identify supportive resources available, engage in team building activities, participate in formal and/or informal workplace support groups, and find a mentor can foster social support within the work setting. Stress reduction interventions may be particularly important for employees with characteristics of negative affectivity who are prone to experience psychological distress in a stressful work environment. Many of these approaches have been discussed in other chapters of this handbook.</Para>

                <Heading>Psychosocial Treatment</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">If negative affective states lead to alcohol and illicit drug use in the workplace, early screening and treating employees with mental health issues (such as depression and anxiety) may reduce substance-abuse problems in the workplace. There is strong evidence to support that the combined use of antidepressant medication and counseling/psychotherapy is superior in reducing depressive symptoms than either treatment alone (Scott, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001055">2001</CitationRef>; The Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study Team, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001058">2004</CitationRef>). In a recent study, Zobel et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001064">2011</CitationRef>) examined the long-term benefits of combined pharmacological and psychotherapeutic depression treatment in 124 in-patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. They randomly assigned the patients to a 5-week interpersonal psychotherapy plus pharmacotherapy (IPT) group, or a medication plus clinical management (CM) group. Results indicated that patients in both treatment groups significantly reduced depressive symptoms between baseline and 5-year follow-up, with a sharper reduction early in the follow-up phase. The rate and acceleration of change in depression was greater for patients in the combination therapy group. Also, 28% of the IPT patients showed a sustained remission compared with 11% of the CM patients (<Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis>  &lt;  0.05). They concluded that, in the long-term, a combination of psycho- and pharmacotherapy was superior in terms of sustained remission rates, relative to standard psychiatric treatment. Early trauma was also found to be a moderator of the relationship between treatment and outcomes, and it should be assessed routinely in depressed patients.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The relationship between employee use of antidepressants and absenteeism has also been examined in employees diagnosed with clinical depression. Birnbaum and his associates (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00104">2010</CitationRef>) studied the effect of antidepressant treatment between compliant and noncompliant comparison groups. While medical costs were similar between compliant and noncompliant patients, drug costs were higher for compliant patients due to the cost of antidepressants. However, costs associated with employee absenteeism were lower for those compliant with antidepressant use ($3,857 vs. $4,907, <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis>  &lt;  0.05), and absenteeism costs were also lower among depressed patients ($3,976 vs. $5,899, <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis>  =  0.047). Conversely, presenteeism costs were greater for depressed patients whom were compliant with antidepressant use ($19,170 vs. $15,829, <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis>  &lt;  0.05). In summary, findings indicate an interaction between compliance and diagnosis of depression, such that increased compliance with antidepressants is significantly associated with reduced absenteeism costs in employees diagnosed with clinical depression.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Given the relationship between employee mental health and workplace productivity, Lerner et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001040">2012</CitationRef>) evaluated the efficacy of a work-focused intervention aimed at treating employees with depression. The intervention was comprised of three components, including (a) work coaching and modification interventions to accommodate specific job performance difficulties related to ­depression, (b) coordination of care between the employee and his or her primary care physician (PCP) or other prescribing professional to promote adherence to pharmacotherapy and the use of evidence-based depression treatment, and (c) cognitive-behavioral therapy strategies to facilitate behavioral change and modification of cognitive distortions that may interfere with functioning and job performance. Compared to the control group who did not receive the work-focused intervention, participants in the intervention group demonstrated significant improvement in all outcome measures, including subscale scores on the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Work Limitations Questionnaire</Emphasis> (time management, performance of physical tasks, performance of mental-interpersonal tasks, and performance of output tasks), productivity loss scores, a measure of work absence, and productivity loss due to absence. The unadjusted mean at-work productivity cost savings for the treatment group was $1,182.70 annually per participant, as compared to $96.10 annually for usual care. In terms of absences, the unadjusted mean savings was $2,395.90 annually per participant in the treatment group, whereas members of the control group averaged an annual cost increase of $3043.30. The total unadjusted mean productivity cost savings for the treatment group was $3,578.60 annually per participant, as compared to an annual cost increase of $2,947.20 per participant in usual care.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In summary, the above research concludes that factors of early screening and treatment, treatment adherence, interventions that combine psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, job accommodation, and workplace support are most important to the effective treatment of mental health problems in the workplace.</Para>

                <Heading>Substance-Abuse Treatment</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Self-medication Hypothesis</Emphasis> is intended to complement current models of addiction, and it does not represent a substitute for more comprehensive biopsychosocial models of addiction (Khantzian &amp; Albanese, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001036">2008</CitationRef>). Therefore, treatment of substance abuse in the workplace must employ a multidimensional approach. Factors specific to the workplace environment, such as physical availability of substances and social acceptance of substance use, can contribute to alcohol or illicit drug use. For many work organizations, an important strategy for minimizing alcohol problems among employees is the establishment and enforcement of policies addressing alcohol use in the workplace. Workplace policies have the potential to alter the workplace culture or other social environments that support substance use in the workplace. At the individual level, several treatment modalities are widely employed to achieve rehabilitation, and new treatment programs are frequently being developed and modified to best meet client needs (Cardoso, Wolfe, &amp; West, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001011">2009</CitationRef>). For instance, behavioral couple therapy is one approach to substance abuse that emphasizes the interaction between the person abusing substances and his or her partner as a key component of sobriety and abstinence (Longabaugh et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001041">2005</CitationRef>). Another treatment modality is alcohol behavioral couple therapy (ABCT), in which both parties, the alcohol-dependent patient and his or her partner, participate in therapy. ABCT derives its underlying theoretical framework from cognitive-behavioral theory, social–interpersonal systems, and social exchange models of intimate relationships. Therapy focuses on developing mutual awareness of high-risk situations, such as fighting with a significant other, that can lead to alcohol use.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Motivational interviewing (MI) addresses alcohol and substance use through directive client-­centered counseling that is aimed at eliciting behavioral change by supporting clients in exploring the substance abuse, resolving ambivalence that a problem exists, and empowering the individual in accepting responsibility for change and avoiding confrontations that lead to negative outcomes (Bombardier, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00107">2000</CitationRef>; Mendel &amp; Hipkins, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001046">2002</CitationRef>; Prochaska &amp; Diclementi, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001053">1986</CitationRef>). There is evidence that patients receiving MI demonstrate greater participation in treatment and are more likely to reduce their substance use when compared to patients who do not receive MI (Hettema, Steele, &amp; Miller, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001029">2005</CitationRef>). Motivational interviewing has also been examined as an intervention in group therapy settings (Santa Ana, Wulfert, &amp; Nietert, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001054">2007</CitationRef>), and researchers have examined the outcomes of group MI (GMI) in work with patients who had coexisting diagnoses of substance abuse and psychiatric disability. Individuals with dual diagnoses tend to exhibit high rates of noncompliance and frequently fail to follow through with aftercare treatment following discharge from inpatient settings. Individuals with dual diagnoses of substance abuse and psychiatric disability are two times as likely to use illicit drugs when compared to persons without a dual diagnosis (Lemaire, Mallik, &amp; Rever, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001039">2004</CitationRef>). When applied to individuals with coexisting substance abuse and psychiatric disability, research suggests that GMI results in greater treatment participation and reduced substance use when compared to patients who did not receive GMI.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Contingency management (CM) is an alternate treatment modality, and it has received considerable attention in recent years. Derived from behavioral theory, CM is a type of operant conditioning that uses reinforcement to reduce or eliminate drug use (Higgins et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001030">1994</CitationRef>), according to the assumption that behavior is controlled or shaped by the consequences of the behavior. Because substance use is heavily influenced by the context in which it occurs, alternative non-drug reinforcement tends to decrease substance use if the rewards are available and used in a manner not compatible with drug use. There are various types of CM, including voucher-based reinforcement therapy (VBRT), in which patients receive vouchers rewarding biological samples (e.g., urine, breath) negative for substances (indicating that the client has remained abstinent of substances). Once earned, vouchers may be exchanged for goods and services compatible with a drug-free lifestyle, and the value of vouchers may increase with continued abstinence and repeated negative findings in biological samples. Conversely, vouchers are withheld if the biological sample is not submitted, or if the sample yields a positive result, confirming the presence of substances in the bloodstream, indicative of recent substance use (Prendergast, Podus, Finney, Greenwell, &amp; Roll, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001052">2006</CitationRef>). An alternate CM program employs variable-magnitude of reinforcement procedures. Similar to the voucher system, this system requires the patient to draw a random number corresponding to a reward. Patients who test positive for substances are not afforded the opportunity to draw a number, whereas patients who test negative for drug use are permitted to select a random number and obtain the corresponding reward. Rewards range in cash value; and the value of a draw increases as long as the person remains abstinent from all substances. In some cases, regular drug testing may represent a condition for treatment (Prendergast et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001052">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In their synthesis of the CM literature, Prendergast et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001052">2006</CitationRef>) conducted a meta-analysis of three CM approaches: (a) voucher-based programs, (b) draws, and (c) take-home doses of methadone or cash. Aggregate findings support the effectiveness of various CM techniques when used during standard treatment programs for dependence on alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. The effect of CM decreases following removal of reinforcement, but the reduction in effect takes place over an extended period of time, allowing the person to continue treatment for longer periods of time while abstinent and motivated to function without drugs.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Another option for employees is self-help groups. Although self-help is not considered a professional treatment per se, self-help groups are ubiquitous and are frequently identified as an adjunctive component to substance-abuse treatment. Self-help groups often reflect the disease model of addiction and are coupled with the 12-steps of recovery, developed by the founding members of Alcoholics’ Anonymous (AA). The success of AA has fostered the development of other self-help groups based on the 12-step program, including Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and Cocaine Anonymous (CA). The first step in the sequential process of recovery requires that the individual recognize that he or she is powerless over substances. Individuals complete the twelfth and final step upon recognition of a “spiritual awakening.” According to the principles of AA, abstinence from substances is maintained long-term through sharing one’s story of addiction and spreading this message to other alcoholics.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Another treatment option involves inpatient treatment programs that typically follow a disease model of addiction and emphasizes 12-steps to recovery (Budziack, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00109">1993</CitationRef>). Inpatient treatment may take place in a medical or community setting. Inpatient programs in the medical setting are housed in a hospital or medical center, and they provide continuous nursing care and direct physician supervision of treatment. Alternatively, inpatient or freestanding programs offer inpatient treatment in a community-based setting with lower levels of direct medical care. Community-based inpatient programs are more appropriate for clients without co-occurring medical conditions, and they can be treated less expensively in the community as opposed to the medical setting. One advantage of inpatient care is interruption of the pattern of use and removal of environmental triggers that tend to increase use. A challenge inherent to inpatient programs lies in generalizing treatment gains to the post-discharge environment, because patients often return to an environment with powerful triggers for drug use.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Similar to inpatient treatment, therapeutic communities require the patient’s full-time residence on-site. Based on social learning theory, therapeutic communities emphasize prevention, skills training, self-help, client responsibility, in addition to two principles unique to therapeutic community philosophy: credible role models and community building (Wexler, Magura, Beardsley, &amp; Josepher, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001062">1994</CitationRef>). Building on social skills and natural supports, cognitive-behavioral training is employed during self-help groups, and behavioral skills training is aimed at overcoming social anxieties, interpreting nonverbal cues, and anger management (Egelko &amp; Galanter, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001017">1993</CitationRef>). The integrated, multimodal approach employed among therapeutic communities empowers members in the formation of one’s self-help concept. Therapeutic communities have been shown to foster a sense of safety and structure in addition to a supportive environment. Research findings suggest that therapeutic communities foster confrontation during reality therapy, which may ultimately benefit reasoning and abstract thought (Bratter, Bratter, Radda, &amp; Steiner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00108">1993</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Although intensive outpatient treatment programs do not require residence, sessions typically entail 4 h of treatment activities per day, 4 days per week for 4 weeks, and are also known as 4  ×  4  ×  4 programs. Outpatient treatment tends to be more problem-focused and employs abbreviated versions of the treatment schedules used in inpatient programs. Importantly, intensive outpatient programs are less expensive than inpatient programs and are often reported to be less intrusive and less stigmatizing.</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusions and Future Directions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Both in terms of the general population and people with co-occurring disabilities, substance abuse and addiction create problems across the spectrum of physical, psychological, and social functioning, including employment (Janikowski et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001031">2005</CitationRef>), and the majority of individuals using substances are employed (SAMHSA, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001056">2011</CitationRef>). In the workplace setting, substance use impairs alertness and reflexes, interferes with accuracy and efficiency, and increases the likelihood of serious accidents (Canadian Center for Occupational Health and Safety, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001010">2008</CitationRef>). Moreover, substance use increases absenteeism, reduces productivity, and negatively affects job performance. Employing the integrative perspective, addiction allows an individual to manage his or her affective, behavioral, and cognitive states (Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001033">1985</CitationRef>; Suh et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001057">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The Self-medication Hypothesis suggests that people use alcohol or illicit drugs in an attempt to treat mental distress, generally distress that has gone untreated or undiagnosed, and drug use behavior may continue into the workplace, thus affecting work performance. In addition, workplace stress may lead to psychosocial distress, resulting in alcohol or illicit drug use, particularly for individuals with problems regulating negative emotion (Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001035">1999</CitationRef>, 1974). When the psychodynamic roots of the Self-medication Hypothesis were challenged by the onset of behaviorism and subsequent focus on reinforcement, Khantzian offered his Updated Theory in which addiction is caused by the impact of the drug of choice on alleviating psychological distress. Distress occurs because people are unable to regulate their emotions, sense of self-worth, relationships, or behavior (Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001033">1985</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001035">1999</CitationRef>; Khantzian &amp; Albanese, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001036">2008</CitationRef>). The second component asserts the selected drug of choice is not random, and selection is based on the impact of a certain drug on his or her affective state (Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001033">1985</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001035">1999</CitationRef>). Therefore, the individual’s drug of choice represents an external mechanism for modifying his or her emotions (Hall &amp; Queener, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001027">2007</CitationRef>; Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001033">1985</CitationRef>; Suh et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001057">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Empirical evidence supporting the self-medication hypothesis in the clinical and epidemiological literature is less than unequivocal. There is evidence to support the association between personality traits and drug-of-choice (Khantzian, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001034">1997</CitationRef>). Most importantly, in order to address substance abuse in the workplace, organizations must recognize the impact of environmental risk factors inherent in the work setting, such as a physical and social availability of substances.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Research on coping and the work-stress relationship find employee’s coping abilities and response to work stress are associated with substance use. Environmental and personal variables interact to affect psychosocial adjustment in the workplace. For example, the employees’ tendency to react negatively to stress, combined with the presence of job-specific and organizational level stressors may increase likelihood of substance use. In addition, individual coping style predicts stress-reduction, such that individuals who demonstrate problem-solving coping tend to be more effective in reducing stress associated with role ambiguity, workload, and lack of resources (Noonan &amp; Wagner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001049">2010</CitationRef>). Conversely, emotional-coping was found to moderate the relationship between stress and alcohol use (Veenstra et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001061">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Intervention methods vary widely, frequently hinging on a specific theoretical orientation of behavioral change. Programs of CM are based on behavioral principles of positive and negative reinforcement, whereas interactional theory guides couples therapy in examining patterns of use in the context of the relationship. Psychosocial treatment is distinct in its integrative, multimodal approach, particularly among the integrative, multimodal approaches of psychosocial treatment and therapeutic communities.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In recent years, the original self-medication hypothesis has been updated to reflect a more integrated model of self-medication, while remaining adaptable to the parameters of a variety of rehabilitation settings, including inpatient, intensive outpatient, and community-based programs. While, the outpatient treatment tends to be more problem-focused, employing abbreviated treatment schedules not unlike those of inpatient programs. Most importantly, treatment services must remain available and accessible to those with substance-use disorders, and given the lower expense when compared to inpatient programs, intensive outpatient programs have great potential for growth. Furthermore, integrative, multimodal approaches to treatment, such as intensive outpatient programs, are often reported to be less intrusive and less stigmatizing than inpatient programs.</Para>
