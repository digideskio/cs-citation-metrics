                <Para ID="Par2">Six to eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice received an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce retinal inflammation, and were treated with an AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR; 250 mg/kg body weight) or phosphate-buffered saline as vehicle 3 h before the LPS injection. The b-wave of the photopic electroretinogram, which represents cone system function, was decreased 24 h after LPS injection and this reduction was suppressed by AICAR treatment. At this time point, there was no remarkable morphological change in the cone photoreceptor cells. At 1.5 h after LPS injection, the retina mRNA levels of an inflammatory cytokine, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Tnf</Emphasis>-<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis>, were increased, and those of a regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Pgc1</Emphasis>-<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis>, were decreased. However, AICAR treatment suppressed these changes in mRNA expression. Immunohistochemistry showed that induction of glial fibrillary acidic protein expression was also suppressed by AICAR 24 h after LPS injection. Furthermore, the mouse cone photoreceptor-derived cell line 661W was treated with AICAR to increase the level of phosphorylated and activated AMPK. After 3 h of AICAR incubation, 661W cells showed decreased <Emphasis Type="Italic">Tnf</Emphasis>-<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis> mRNA levels and increased <Emphasis Type="Italic">Pgc1</Emphasis>-<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis> mRNA levels.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par11">Retinal inflammation is involved in the majority of retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, which seriously threaten vision. This is because inflammatory signaling in the retina can cause retinal neural disorders and visual disorders [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. However, the molecular mechanism underlying retinal inflammation and its consequent effects on vision is not fully understood, thus limiting the development of an effective therapeutic approach. Here, we focus on activated 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an essential signaling molecule for cellular energy and mitochondrial homeostasis, which decreases in the retina during inflammation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. We previously demonstrated that the level of phosphorylated and activated AMPK was reduced and an inflammatory transcription factor, NF-κB, was activated in the retina which indicates the retinal inflammation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>], and rod system function is impaired in the endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) mouse model induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. In this model, major blood vessels are dilated and monocytes adhere to them in the retina, which also indicates retinal inflammation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. However, whether cone system dysfunction is induced during inflammation has yet to be seen. In this study, we analyzed the photopic electroretinogram (ERG), which represents cone system function, during inflammation in the EIU mouse model, and evaluated the ability of AMPK to preserve cone system function.</Para>

                <Para ID="Par12">Six to eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan) were maintained in an air-conditioned room under a 12-h dark/light cycle, with free access to food and water. The mice were randomly divided into three groups; control non-EIU with vehicle treatment, EIU with vehicle treatment, and EIU with AICAR treatment groups. The mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of 6.0 mg/kg body weight (BW) LPS from <Emphasis Type="Italic">Escherichia coli</Emphasis> (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, USA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to generate an EIU model which develops retinitis as well as uveitis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. The mice were treated with the specific AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at 250 mg/kg BW or PBS as vehicle 3 h before the LPS injection. Reduction in the activated AMPK level during inflammation and its suppression by AICAR were confirmed previously [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and the protocol for this study was approved by the Keio University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (permission no. 08002) (Tokyo, Japan). For accuracy, all the experiments were repeated 2 or 3 times, but the number of the animals used in each experiment was minimized to follow the guideline. There were no important adverse events during the experiments.</Para>

                <Para ID="Par19">In these mice, we first evaluated the photopic ERG 24 h after LPS injection when rod photoreceptor responses in ERG had already been clearly reduced in this model [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]; Representative waveforms from an individual mouse in each group and means of each group are shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>a, b, respectively. The photopic ERG b-wave, which represents cone system function [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>], was decreased in the EIU model, and this reduction was suppressed by AICAR treatment (b-wave amplitudes in non-EIU with vehicle treatment, EIU with vehicle treatment, and EIU with AICAR treatment groups: 97.5 ± 41.2, 39.3 ± 34.7, and 71.6 ± 48.8 μV in response to 0.46 log cds m<Superscript>2</Superscript> light stimuli; 185.5 ± 75.6, 80.5 ± 51.1, and 165.5 ± 48.0 μV in response to 1.39 log cds m<Superscript>2</Superscript> stimuli; 243.0 ± 81.9, 112.1 ± 86.6, and 233.7 ± 110.9 μV in response to 2.89 log cds m<Superscript>2</Superscript> stimuli) (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>a, b). Under this condition, rod photoreceptor cells are saturated and cannot be detected with light adaptation. These findings indicate that cone system dysfunction occurred during inflammation via reduced AMPK activation. Although the outer segment (OS) length is shortened in the rods during inflammation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>], the OS length of the cones was maintained in the current study. This was measured in the cryosections obtained 24 h after LPS injection that showed a positive reaction with the cone marker peanut agglutinin (data not shown). Therefore, cone system dysfunction was observed in this inflammatory model, even without remarkable morphological changes.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

              <Heading>Discussion</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par23">We demonstrated that cone system function was decreased after LPS injection. This reduction was suppressed by AICAR treatment, although there was no remarkable morphological change in the cone photoreceptor cells. The retina mRNA levels of an inflammatory cytokine, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Tnf</Emphasis>-<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis>, were increased, and those of a regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Pgc1</Emphasis>-<Emphasis Type="Italic">α,</Emphasis> were decreased at the earlier time point after LPS injection. Immunohistochemistry showed that induction of GFAP expression was also suppressed by the time point when cone system dysfunction was recorded. However, AICAR treatment suppressed all these changes in the EIU mice. Furthermore, in the mouse cone photoreceptor-derived cell line 661W, induction of activated AMPK by AICAR decreased <Emphasis Type="Italic">Tnf</Emphasis>-<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis> mRNA levels and increased <Emphasis Type="Italic">Pgc1</Emphasis>-<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis> mRNA levels.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par24">Given that TNF-α-induced neurotoxicity can be mediated by rapid mitochondrial dysfunction [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>], the cone system dysfunction during inflammation may be related to this pathway; in fact, in this study, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Tnf</Emphasis>-<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis> was induced and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Pgc1</Emphasis>-<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis> was repressed during the inflammation that caused cone system dysfunction. Moreover, AMPK activation played a direct role in suppressing these effects, suggesting a critical role of activated AMPK. The mechanism suggested by these results is as follows: reduction in activated AMPK may induce an inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, during inflammation, which would disrupt mitochondrial homeostasis, at least in part, in the cone photoreceptor cells, thereby impairing cone system function during retinal inflammation. AMPK activation may be an intrinsic self-defense mechanism for cone photoreceptor cells to maintain a healthy condition, and any breakdown of this mechanism during inflammation would lead to dysfunction.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par25">Furthermore, the fact that GFAP expression induced during inflammation was also suppressed by AICAR implicates an indirect role for Müller glial cells in the neuroprotective effect on the cone photoreceptor neurons during inflammation. TNF-α can be expressed by both photoreceptors and Müller glial cells [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. Nonetheless, the present in vitro results suggest a direct effect of AMPK activation, at least in part, in the protection of cone photoreceptor neurons.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par26">Functional impairment in our model could have preceded any visible morphological damage, although minimum architectural changes cannot be excluded. The discrepancy between function and morphology is not uncommon in human subjects with uveitis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. Indeed, Holder et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>] reported that the cone functional damage preceded morphological changes in patients with inflammatory disorders, and, in some cases, improvement following treatment preceded visible clinical signs of recovery. This indicates that an inflammatory reaction can cause cone system dysfunction, which may cause central visual impairment in humans even with no marked architectural alteration. Thus, cone system dysfunction could be an early sign of inflammatory disease, as well as a sensitive parameter for measuring treatment efficacy, although the findings in the current study were obtained from mice and not human, thus further study is required to fully discuss the human findings.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par27">Cone system dysfunction may occur during inflammation, at least in part, through decreased levels of activated AMPK. An AMPK activator, AICAR, protected the function of the cone photoreceptor system during inflammation, repressing an inflammatory cytokine, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Tnf</Emphasis>-<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis>, and preserving a regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Pgc1</Emphasis>-<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis>.
