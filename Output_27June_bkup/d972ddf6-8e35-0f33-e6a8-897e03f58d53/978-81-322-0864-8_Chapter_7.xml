          <Para TextBreak="No">An endangered species is a population of organisms which is at risk of becoming extinct because it is either few in numbers, or threatened by changing environmental or predation parameters. The first criterion to conserve the biodiversity of the planet is to take into consideration the reasons why so many species are becoming endangered. ‘Habitat loss is the most widespread cause of species endangerment in the U.S., affecting 85% of imperiled species’. When an animal’s ecosystem is not maintained, they lose their home and are either forced to adapt to new surroundings or perish. Pollution is another factor that causes many species to become endangered. Also, over-exploitation, disease and climate change have led to the endangerment of several species. An endangered species is defined as a population of an organism that is at the danger of becoming extinct because of several reasons. Endangered species in India include large varieties of rare species of flora and fauna. Indian wildlife that comprises numerous species of birds, animals, mammals, etc. is well famous for being one of the richest in the world. The Indian wildlife also contains several endangered species that are living critically on the verge of extinction.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">In biology, a species is one of the basic units of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as a group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring. While in many cases this definition is adequate, the difficulty of defining species is known as the species problem. Differing measures are often used, such as similarity of DNA, morphology or ecological niche. Presence of specific locally adapted traits may further subdivide species into ‘infraspecific taxa’ such as subspecies. Species hypothesised to have the same ancestors are placed in one genus, based on similarities. The similarity of species is based on comparison of physical attributes, especially their DNA sequences, where available. All species are given a two-part name, a ‘binomial name’. The first part of a binomial name is the generic name, the genus of the species. The second part is either called the specific name (a term used only in zoology) or the specific epithet (the term used in botany, which can also be used in zoology). For example, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Boa constrictor</Emphasis> is one of four species of the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Boa</Emphasis> genus. The first part of the name is capitalised, and the second part has a lower case. The binomial name is written in italics.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">A usable definition of the word ‘species’ and reliable methods of identifying particular species are essential for stating and testing biological theories and for measuring biodiversity, though other taxonomic levels such as families may be considered in broad-scale studies (Sahney et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2010</CitationRef>). Extinct species known only from fossils are generally difficult to assign precise taxonomic rankings, which is why higher taxonomic levels such as families are often used for fossil-based studies (Sahney et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2010</CitationRef>; Sahney and Benton <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2008</CitationRef>). The total number of nonbacterial species in the world has been estimated at 8.7 million, with previous estimates ranging from 2 to 100 million.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It is surprisingly difficult to define the word ‘species’ in a way that applies to all naturally occurring organisms, and the debate among biologists about how to define ‘species’ and how to identify actual species is called the species problem. Over two dozen distinct definitions of ‘species’ are in use among biologists (Wilkins <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Most textbooks follow Ernst Mayr’s definition of a species as ‘groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups’ (de Queiroz <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Various parts of this definition serve to exclude some unusual or artificial matings:<UnorderedList Mark="Bullet">
              <ItemContent>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Those that occur only in captivity (when the animal’s normal mating partners may not be available) or as a result of deliberate human action</Para>

          </Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The typical textbook definition above works well for most multicelled organisms, but there are several types of situations in which it breaks down:<UnorderedList Mark="Bullet">
              <ItemContent>
                <Para TextBreak="No">By definition it applies only to organisms that reproduce sexually. So it does not work for asexually reproducing single-celled organisms and for the relatively few parthenogenetic multicelled organisms. The term ‘phylotype’ is often applied to such organisms.</Para>
              </ItemContent>
              <ItemContent>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Biologists frequently do not know whether two morphologically similar groups of organisms are ‘potentially’ capable of interbreeding.</Para>
              </ItemContent>
              <ItemContent>
                <Para TextBreak="No">There is considerable variation in the degree to which hybridisation may succeed under natural conditions or even in the degree to which some organisms use sexual reproduction between individuals to breed.</Para>
              </ItemContent>
              <ItemContent>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In ring species, members of adjacent populations interbreed successfully but members of some nonadjacent populations do not.</Para>
              </ItemContent>
              <ItemContent>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In a few cases it may be physically impossible for animals that are members of the same species to mate. However, these are cases, such as in breeds of dogs, in which human intervention has caused gross morphological changes and are therefore excluded by the biological species concept.</Para>
              </ItemContent>
            </UnorderedList>
          </Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Horizontal gene transfer makes it even more difficult to define the word ‘species’. There is strong evidence of horizontal gene transfer between very dissimilar groups of prokaryotes and at least occasionally between dissimilar groups of eukaryotes, and Williamson argues that there is evidence for it in some crustaceans and echinoderms. All definitions of the word ‘species’ assume that an organism gets all its genes from one or two parents that are very like that organism, but horizontal gene transfer makes that assumption false.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The question of how best to define ‘species’ is one that has occupied biologists for centuries, and the debate itself has become known as the species problem. Darwin wrote <Emphasis Type="Italic">On the Origin of Species</Emphasis>: No one definition has satisfied all naturalists, yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species. Generally the term includes the unknown element of a distinct act of creation.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">But later, in The Descent of Man, when addressing ‘The question whether mankind consists of one or several species’, Darwin revised his opinion to say, it is a hopeless endeavour to decide this point on sound grounds, until some definition of the term ‘species’ is generally accepted, and the definition must not include an element that cannot possibly be ascertained, such as an act of creation.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The modern theory of evolution depends on a fundamental redefinition of ‘species’. Prior to Darwin, naturalists viewed species as ideal or general types, which could be exemplified by an ideal specimen bearing all the traits general to the species. Darwin’s theories shifted attention from uniformity to variation and from the general to the particular. According to intellectual historian Louis Menand, ‘Once our attention is redirected to the individual, we need another way of making generalizations. We are no longer interested in the conformity of an individual to an ideal type; we are now interested in the relation of an individual to the other individuals with which it interacts. To generalize about groups of interacting individuals, we need to drop the language of types and essences, which is prescriptive (telling us what finches should be), and adopt the language of statistics and probability, which is predictive (telling us what the average finch, under specified conditions, is likely to do). Relations will be more important than categories; functions, which are variable, will be more important than purposes; transitions will be more important than boundaries; sequences will be more important than hierarchies’ (Menand <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2001</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">This shift results in a new approach to ‘species’; Darwin concluded that species are what they appear to be: ideas, which are provisionally useful for naming groups of interacting individuals. ‘I look at the term species’, he wrote, ‘as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other … It does not essentially differ from the word variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for convenience sake’ (Menand <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2001</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Practically, biologists define species as populations of organisms that have a high level of genetic similarity. This may reflect an adaptation to the same niche, and the transfer of genetic material from one individual to others, through a variety of possible means. The exact level of similarity used in such a definition is arbitrary, but this is the most common definition used for organisms that reproduce asexually (asexual reproduction), such as some plants and microorganisms.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">This lack of any clear species concept in microbiology has led to some authors arguing that the term ‘species’ is not useful when studying bacterial evolution. Instead they see genes as moving freely between even distantly related bacteria, with the entire bacterial domain being a single gene pool. Nevertheless, a kind of rule of thumb has been established, saying that species of <Emphasis Type="Italic">bacteria</Emphasis> or <Emphasis Type="Italic">archaea</Emphasis> with 16S rRNA gene sequences more similar than 97% to each other need to be checked by DNA–DNA hybridisation if they belong to the same species or not (Stackebrandt and Goebel <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">1994</CitationRef>). This concept has been updated recently, saying that the border of 97% was too low and can be raised to 98.7% (Stackebrandt and Ebers <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In the study of sexually reproducing organisms, where genetic material is shared through the process of reproduction, the ability of two organisms to interbreed and produce fertile offspring of both sexes is generally accepted as a simple indicator that the organisms share enough genes to be considered members of the same species. Thus, a ‘species’ is a group of interbreeding organisms.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">This definition can be extended to say that a species is a group of organisms that could potentially interbreed—fish could still be classed as the same species even if they live in different lakes, as long as they could still interbreed were ever they to come into contact with each other. On the other hand, there are many examples of series of three or more distinct populations, where individuals of the population in the middle can interbreed with the populations to either side but individuals of the populations on either side cannot interbreed. Thus, one could argue that these populations constitute a single species or two distinct species. This is not a paradox; it is evidence that species are defined by gene frequencies and thus have fuzzy boundaries.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Consequently, any single, universal definition of ‘species’ is necessarily arbitrary. Instead, biologists have proposed a range of definitions; which definition a biologists uses is a pragmatic choice, depending on the particularities of that biologist’s research.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In practice, these definitions often coincide, and the differences between them are more a matter of emphasis than of outright contradiction. Nevertheless, no species concept yet proposed is entirely objective or can be applied in all cases without resorting to judgment. Given the complexity of life, some have argued that such an objective definition is in all likelihood impossible, and biologists should settle for the most practical definition.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">For most vertebrates, this is the biological species concept (BSC) and to a lesser extent (or for different purposes) the phylogenetic species concept (PSC). Many BSC subspecies are considered species under the PSC; the difference between the BSC and the PSC can be summed up insofar as that the BSC defines a species as a consequence of manifest evolutionary history, while the PSC defines a species as a consequence of manifest evolutionary potential. Thus, a PSC species is ‘made’ as soon as an evolutionary lineage has started to separate, while a BSC species starts to exist only when the lineage separation is complete. Accordingly, there can be considerable conflict between alternative classifications based upon the PSC versus BSC, as they differ completely in their treatment of taxa that would be considered subspecies under the latter model (e.g. the numerous subspecies of honey bees).</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">A group of organisms in which individuals are members of the species if they sufficiently conform to certain fixed properties or ‘rights of passage’. The clusters of variations or phenotypes within specimens (i.e. longer or shorter tails) would differentiate the species. This method was used as a ‘classical’ method of determining species, such as with Linnaeus early in evolutionary theory. However, we now know that different phenotypes do not always constitute different species (e.g. a 4-winged <Emphasis Type="Italic">Drosophila</Emphasis> born to a 2-winged mother is not a different species). Species named in this manner are called morphospecies (Stackebrandt and Ebers <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>

At some point in the evolution of such a group, some members may diverge from the main population and evolve into a subspecies, a process that may eventually lead to the formation of a new species if isolation (geographical or ecological) is maintained. A species that gives rise to another species is a paraphyletic species, or paraspecies.</Para>

At some point in the progress of such a group, members may diverge from one another: When such a divergence becomes sufficiently clear, the two populations are regarded as separate species. This differs from evolutionary species in that the parent species goes extinct taxonomically when a new species evolves, the mother and daughter populations now forming two new species (Ereshefsky <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2002</CitationRef>). Subspecies as such are not recognised under this approach; either a population is a phylogenetic species or it is not taxonomically distinguishable.</Para>

This species concept is highly criticised because more recent genetic data reveal that genetically distinct populations may look very similar, and, contrarily, large morphological differences sometimes exist between very closely related populations. Nonetheless, most species known have been described solely from morphology.</Para>

            <Heading>Implications of Applying Species Status</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The naming of a particular species may be regarded as a hypothesis about the evolutionary relationships and distinguishability of that group of organisms. As further information comes to hand, the hypothesis may be confirmed or refuted. Sometimes, especially in the past when communication was more difficult, taxonomists working in isolation have given two distinct names to individual organisms later identified as the same species. When two named species are discovered to be of the same species, the older species name is usually retained and the newer species name dropped, a process called synonymisation or, colloquially, as lumping. Dividing a taxon into multiple, often new, taxons is called splitting. Taxonomists are often referred to as ‘lumpers’ or ‘splitters’ by their colleagues, depending on their personal approach to recognising differences or commonalities between organisms.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Traditionally, researchers relied on observations of anatomical differences, and on observations of whether different populations were able to interbreed successfully, to distinguish species; both anatomy and breeding behaviour are still important to assigning species status. As a result of the revolutionary (and still ongoing) advance in microbiological research techniques, including DNA analysis, in the last few decades, a great deal of additional knowledge about the differences and similarities between species has become available. Many populations formerly regarded as separate species are now considered a single taxon, and many formerly grouped populations have been split. Any taxonomic level (species, genus, family, etc.) can be synonymised or split, and at higher taxonomic levels, these revisions have been still more profound.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">From a taxonomical point of view, groups within a species can be defined as being of a taxon hierarchically lower than a species. In zoology only the subspecies is used, while in botany the variety, subvariety and form are used as well. In conservation biology, the concept of evolutionary significant units (ESU) is used, which may define either species or smaller distinct population segments. Identifying and naming species is the providence of alpha taxonomy.</Para>

Many nations have laws offering protection to conservation-reliant species, for example, forbidding hunting, restricting land development or creating preserves. Only a few of the many species is at risk of extinction actually make it to the lists and obtain legal protection like pandas.

Nigel Stork in the article ‘Re-assessing Extinction Rate’ explains, ‘the key cause of extinction being climate change, and in particular rising temperatures, rather than deforestation alone’. Stork believes climate change is the major issue as to why species are becoming endangered. Stork claims rising temperature on a local and global level are making it harder for species to reproduce. As global warming continues, species are no longer able to survive and their progeny starts deteriorating. This is a repeating cycle that is starting to increase at a rapid rate because of climate change, therefore landing many species on the endangered species list.</Para>

          <Heading>Impact on Biodiversity and Endangered Species</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The first criterion to conserve the biodiversity of the planet is to take into consideration the reasons why so many species are becoming endangered. ‘Habitat loss is the most widespread cause of species endangerment in the U.S., affecting 85% of imperiled species’. When an animal’s ecosystem is not maintained, they lose their home and are either forced to adapt to new surroundings or perish. Pollution is another factor that causes many species to become endangered. Also, over-exploitation, disease and climate change have led to the endangerment of several species.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Humans have an impact on the species and their environment. ‘As human use of resources, energy, and space intensified over the past few centuries, the diversity of life has been substantially diminished in most parts of the world’. Humans also have set standards for which species they think should be saved and which species they find unimportant or undesirable. For example, the coqui frog, an invasive species in Hawaii, is so common there that its ‘nocturnal singing’ reduces the value of homes and prevents hotels from using rooms near forests. Hawaiians have proposed eliminating the frog, and several wildlife managers want to release a pathogen to kill the frogs. The frog has decreased the value of homes and caused a loss of business for several hotels, so the Hawaiians decided that it was acceptable to get rid of the group of coqui frog living near them. Another example where the human impact affected the welfare of a species sex is the instance of non-native mute swans establishing themselves at Arrowhead Lake in Vermont. When the population of swans grew to eight birds, the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department decided to take action. Two swans were eventually killed, angering animal welfare organisations and people living near the lake.</Para>

          <Heading>Species Maintaining Importance</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">‘Diversity of life and living systems are a necessary condition for human development’. Many question the importance of maintaining biodiversity in today’s world, where conservation efforts prove costly and time-consuming. Species should be saved for ‘aesthetic and moral justifications; the importance of wild species as providers of products and services are essential to human welfare. The value of particular species as indicators of environmental health or as keystone species is crucial to the functioning of ecosystems; and the scientific breakthroughs that have come from the study of wild organisms’ Goldenberg (<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2011</CitationRef>). In other words, species serve as a source of art and entertainment. They provide products such as medicine for human well-being, indicate the welfare of the overall environment and ecosystem, and provide research that resulted in scientific discoveries. An example of an ‘aesthetic justification’ in conserving endangered species is the introduction of the grey wolf into Yellowstone National Park. The grey wolf has brought numerous amounts of tourists to the park and added to the biodiversity in the protected region. Another example, supporting the conservation of endangered species as providers of products for human well-being, is the scrub mint. It has been found that the scrub mint contains an antifungal agent and a natural insecticide. The deterioration of the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon ‘alerted people to the potential health hazards associated with the widespread spraying of DDT and other persistent pesticides’. This serves as an example of how certain fish can serve as identifiers of environmental health and protect human life as well as other species. Finally, an example of species providing for scientific discoveries is the instance of the Pacific yew which ‘became the source of taxol, one of the most potent anticancer compounds ever discovered’. Endangered species could prove useful to human development, maintenance of biodiversity and preservation of ecosystems. Another approach is known as ecosystem conservation, where a focus is placed less on preserving any individual given species than on preserving the proper functioning of the ecosystem as a whole.</Para>

          <Heading>Preservation of Endangered Species</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It is the goal of conservationists to create and expand upon ways to preserve endangered species and maintain biodiversity. There are several ways in which one can aid in preserving the world’s species who are nearing extinction. One such way is obtaining more information on different groups of species, especially invertebrates, fungi and marine organisms, where sufficient data is lacking. For example, to understand the causes of population decline and extinction an experiment was conducted on the butterfly population in Finland. In this analysis, the butterflies’ endangered list classification, distribution, density, larval specificity, dispersal ability, adult habitat breadth, flight period and body size were all recorded and examined to determine the threatened state of each species. It was found that the butterflies’ distribution has declined by fifty-one and a half percent, and they have a severely restricted habitat. One example of specific butterflies who have a declining distribution rate are the Frigga’s Fritillary and Grizzled Skipper, who have been affected by habitat loss due to extensive draining of the bogs where they live. This experiment shows that when one knows the causes of endangerment, then one can successfully create solutions for the management of biodiversity.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Another way to help preserve endangered species is to create a new professional society dedicated to ecological ethics. This could help ecologists make ethical decisions in their research and management of biodiversity. Also, creating more awareness on environmental ethics can help to encourage species preservation. ‘Courses in ethics for students, and training programs for ecologists and biodiversity managers’ all could create environmental awareness and prevent violations of ethics in research and management. One final way in which one can conserve endangered species is through federal agency investments and protection enacted by the federal government. ‘Ecologists have proposed biological corridors, biosphere reserves, ecosystem management, and ecoregional planning as approaches to integrate biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic development at increasingly larger spatial scales’. One example of a federal mandated conservation zone is the Northwest Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument, the largest marine protected area in the world. The monument is essential for the preservation of underwater communities and overfished regions. Only researchers working in the area are permitted to fish, no corals may be removed and the Department of Homeland Security will enforce restrictions on vessels passing through the waters via satellite imaging. The monument will serve as a home to an estimated 7,000 species, most of which cannot be found anywhere else in the world. This environmental monument demonstrates the fact that it is possible to create a safe environment for endangered species, as well as maintaining some of the world’s largest ecosystems.</Para>

          <Heading>Captive Breeding Programmes</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Captive breeding is the process of breeding rare or endangered species in human controlled environments with restricted settings, such as wildlife preserves, zoos and other conservation facilities. Captive breeding is meant to save species from becoming extinct. It is supposed to stabilise the population of the species so it is no longer at risk for disappearing (Captive Breeding Populations <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">This technique has been used with success for many species for some time, with probably the oldest known such instances of captive mating being attributed to menageries of European and Asian rulers. However, captive breeding techniques are usually difficult to implement for highly mobile species like some migratory birds (e.g. cranes) and fishes (e.g. Hilsa). Additionally, if the captive breeding population is too small, inbreeding may occur due to a reduced gene pool; this may lead to the population lacking immunity to diseases.</Para>

          <Heading>Endangered Species in India</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Endangered species in India include large varieties of rare species of flora and fauna. Indian wildlife that comprises numerous species of birds, animals, mammals, etc. is well famous for being one of the richest in the world. The Indian wildlife also contains several endangered species that are living critically on the verge of extinction. An endangered species is defined as a population of an organism that is at the danger of becoming extinct because of several reasons. Either they are few in number or are threatened by the varying environmental or predation parameters. The endangered species in India have been identified by different national and international organisations like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII). As per the official records, in India, there are over 130,000 endangered animal species. However, some claim that the number is actually much more.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The increasing destruction of the natural habitat such as the biosphere reserves and tropical forests has posed a threat to the natural endangered treasure. Mainly four reasons have been identified behind the extinction of endangered species in India. These are loss of a species as a biological entity, destabilisation of an ecosystem, endangerment of other species and loss of irreplaceable genetic material and associated biochemicals. When one species goes extinct, population increases or declines often result in secondary species. There is a possibility for an unstable spiral to arise, until other species are lost and the ecosystem structure is changed markedly and irreversibly. The endangered species in India have been divided into four main categories—critically endangered (CR), endangered (EN), vulnerable (VU) and threatened. This classification was done by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and Wildlife Institute of India (WII), in the year 2004. The population of the endangered species has been decreasing every passing minute.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The number of endangered species in India accounts for around 8.86% of the world’s mammals. The mammals are extended over 186 genera, 45 families and 13 orders out of which around 89 species are listed as threatened in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals (IUCN 2006). This also includes two species that are already locally extinct from India and the species are <Emphasis Type="Italic">Acinonyx jubatus</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Rhinoceros sondaicus</Emphasis>. The mammals are actually the class of vertebrate animals, and they are mainly characterised by the presence of mammary glands, the presence of hair or fur, specialised teeth, the presence of a neocortex region in the brain and endothermic or ‘warm-blooded’ bodies. The mammals include nearly 5,500 species in the world. However, this varies with the classification scheme.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Among the endangered species in India, one of the most critically endangered one is the Siberian Tiger. This is a rare subspecies of tiger and they are an endangered species in India. The Asian Elephants found in India have also become the victims to the ever famous ivory poaching. However, their decline’s main cause is considered to be the loss of habitat. According to the Elephants’ Preservation Act, passed in India in the year 1879, ‘no wild elephant shall be killed or captured unless in a person’s self-defence, or because of damage being caused’. Another endangered species in India is one of the big cats, the Golden Leopard with black marks. The number of this species has been reduced to as low as 14,000, in India.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The main reasons behind the decline of leopard population in India have been the loss of habitat and also human population pressure on wildlife reserves in India. These reasons are also a matter of great concern for the other endangered species in India. The major reason behind the habitat loss is the spread of agriculture. The Bengal Tigers were also extensively being captured for pet trade, zoos and research, as well as for use in Oriental medicine, in the past. Further, the critically endangered species in India, as identified by the IUCN and WII, include the Jenkins Shrew, Malabar Large-spotted Civet, Namdapha Flying Squirrel, Pygmy Hog, Salim Ali’s Fruit Bat, Sumatran Rhinoceros and the Wroughton’s Free-tailed Bat. The list of endangered species in India include the Asiatic Lion, Asiatic Black Bear, Desert Cat, Great Indian Rhinoceros, Hispid Hare, Hoolock Gibbon, Kashmir Stag, Lion-tailed Macaque, Malabar Civet, Markhor, Nayan Ovis, Nilgiri Leaf Monkey, Pygmy Hog, Andaman Shrew, Andaman Spiny Shrew, Indian Elephant or Asian Elephant, Banteng, Blue Whale, Capped Leaf Monkey, Chiru, Fin Whale, Ganges River Dolphin, Golden Leaf Monkey, Hispid Hare, Asian Arowana, Loggerhead Sea Turtle, Hoolock Gibbon, Indus River Dolphin, Kondana Soft-furred Rat, Lion-tailed Macaque, Markhor, Marsh Mongoose, Nicobar Shrew, Nicobar Tree Shrew, Nilgiri Tahr, Parti-coloured Flying Squirrel, Peter’s Tube-nosed Bat, Red Panda, Sei Whale, Servant Mouse, Snow Leopard, Tiger, Wild Water Buffalo and the Woolly Flying Squirrel.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Apart from the critically endangered and the endangered species in India, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and Wildlife Institute of India also identified several species as vulnerable in India.

          <Heading>Identifying of Species</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Identifying species remains a controversial endeavour. Species debates persist on many fronts in evolutionary biology, ranging from philosophical exchanges about the biological ‘reality’ of species to fundamental disagreement about which operational concepts most closely reflect the processes by which new species arise. As these debates continue, conservation biologists and wildlife managers face a difficult and pressing challenge—they must decide what constitutes a ‘good’ species for conservation purposes and then apply these criteria to establish species boundaries in rare or threatened taxa.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Accurately defining species is critical to protecting biodiversity. Species continue to be the fundamental biological units that warrant legal protection under both national and international laws. When such laws are invoked, species boundaries determine the biological scope of all subsequent monitoring and recovery efforts. Hence, neglecting taxonomy can unwittingly lead to population declines and in some cases, complete species extinctions. Species boundaries can also serve to protect the larger ecosystems that endangered species occupy. Moreover, species are the common currency used to determine centres of endemism and biodiversity hotspots, geographic areas typically viewed as having the highest priority for protection. Hence, even conservation efforts focused on protecting ecosystems at regional or global scales rely heavily on how species are defined locally.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In recent reviews, scientists have argued that species propositions should be treated as biological hypotheses that can be explicitly tested. Yet practitioners attempting to evaluate species boundaries this way must contend with well over 25 unique species concepts, each emphasising different biological criteria that in some way characterise the overall process of evolutionary divergence. Species have been defined into four general categories: (1) phylogenetic species concepts emphasising shared evolutionary histories among populations; (2) similarity species concepts defined by common phenotypic features of the organisms, especially shared morphological traits; (3) ecological species concepts marked by adaptations to local environmental conditions; and (4) biological species concepts based on the ability of organisms to mate and produce viable offspring. Ideally, descriptions of species should address each of these four classes of concepts, but in practice this is seldom accomplished.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Ideally, the definition of the environmental management class (EMC) should be based on existing empirical relationships between flow changes and ecological status/conditions, which are associated with clearly identifiable thresholds. Therefore, EMC is a management concept that has been developed and used in the world because of a need to make decisions regardless of the limited lucid hydro-ecological knowledge available. The following are points that would go into determining the EMC for a particular river:</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The rationale for ecological sensitivity and importance of river basin is that the higher the ecological sensitivity and importance of aquatic ecosystems in a river basin is, the higher the EMC should be, ideally. The more natural the current condition of the basin is, the greater the incentive for its maintenance as such. If the deterioration of aquatic environment continues, it will be more difficult to achieve a higher EMC, even if it is necessary, due to its high importance and sensitivity.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">As this is the first time that such an approach is introduced in India, the focus would be on highlighting the main aquatic features and problems of each basin. This means that aggregate environmental indicators, which reflect different features or conditions of a river basin, could be used for scoring. Among the recent relevant works on this, the first question asked may be seen as an attempt to design a condensed measure of the ecological value of the basin, albeit in nonmonetary terms. An arbitrarily selected set of semi-quantitative and quantitative indicators includes:<UnorderedList Mark="Bullet">

              </UnorderedList>
            </Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Considering that most of the ‘ecological’ attention in countries like India has so far been given to fish, such indicators as rare and endangered biota and unique biota are calculated here using available fish data. Rare and endangered fish species are first identified using IUCN (1994) categories such as CR (critically endangered) and EN (endangered). Their cumulative number is then expressed as the proportion of the total number of fish species found in a river basin. The assessment of diversity of aquatic habitats and sensitivity of aquatic ecosystems to flow reduction requires expert judgment and knowledge of a particular river. Presence of protected or pristine areas can be assessed against existing guidelines for protected area management, that is, IUCN (1980), which sets the aim of 10% of the basin to be protected. The second question to be asked relates to what the river system looks like at present, compared to a reference condition in the past or compared to some similar and relatively undisturbed subbasins in the same physiographic settings. The indicators used in this study include:<UnorderedList Mark="Bullet">

                </ItemContent>
              </UnorderedList>
            </Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The first two indicators are normally estimated from the GIS maps, remote sensing data or already published literature sources. In some cases, a percentage of the floodplain areas actually remaining in a basin compared to some past reference condition may be used as an alternative to the second indicator. A proportion of exotic species can be calculated as a percentage of the number of total fish species recorded in the basin. Overall species richness may be assessed as a proportion of the total number of species in a country; in a larger geographical region, whichever is more appropriate; or by an expert score on a scale from low to high. The most straightforward way of calculating the degree of flow regulation is as a ratio of total storage of all dams to the long-term mean annual natural flow volume of the basin. It is acknowledged though that this approach does not recognise timing or types of flow events that are altered—which may be more critical than change in volume per se. A degree of river fragmentation can be represented by a simple indicator of spatial changes to habitat—longitudinal and latitudinal connectivity of rivers.</Para>
