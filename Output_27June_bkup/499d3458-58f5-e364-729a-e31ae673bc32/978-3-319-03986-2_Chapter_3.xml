          <Para TextBreak="No">This chapter presents another major topic in health social sciences: health and illness behaviours. Social responses to health and illness have been widely researched for various kinds of medical conditions. The chapter proceeds with a definition of health behaviour, introducing associated concepts such as preventive health behaviour (PHB), protective health behaviour, and health-seeking behaviour. The concept of risk behaviour is examined with its specific patterns including sedentary lifestyle, alcohol and drug use, smoking behaviour and use of tobacco, sexual behaviour, and dietary behaviour. Illness behaviour is presented by examining its various conceptions. The Chrisman’s stages of illness behaviour are presented as a conceptual discourse in understanding health-seeking behaviour. The chapter ends with a discussion of factors affecting health and illness behaviours (including illness attributes/perception, socioeconomic status, gender, education, age, religion, and location) with some illustration from the African context.</Para>

          <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Having discussed the conceptions of health, disease, and illness in the previous chapter, this chapter presents another major theme in medical sociological studies: health and illness behaviours. Health and illness behaviours for various kinds of medical conditions have been widely researched in sociology. Sociologists continue to investigate how people respond to their health or illness condition. The basic concern includes the what, how, and why of health and illness behaviours. Generally, understanding human behaviour has been the bedrock of sociological studies. Sociologists want to understand, explain, control, and predict human behaviours. Understanding human behaviour involves the comprehension of the motivation behind behaviour. Why do people behaviour the way they do? What are the factors that trigger a particular behaviour in any given situation? In health-seeking behaviour, it is important to understand what people may or usually do in case of any concern about their health. For instance, what would people do to prevent cancer<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Cancer</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> or any other illness conditions? Would people stop sun-bathing to prevent skin cancer or use a condom to prevent HIV? Understanding the use of appropriate preventive and treatment measures is a central focus in the study of health and illness behaviours.</Para>

              <Secondary>definition</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm> is synonymous with preventive health behaviour (PHB)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Preventive health behaviour (PHB)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. It refers to a person’s way of preventing a disease, defect, injury, and disability. In what has been cited as a classic definition, Kasl and Cobb (<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">1966</CitationRef>, p. 246)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Kasl, S.U.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> posited that “health behaviour refers to those activities undertaken by a person believing himself [or herself] to be healthy, for the purpose of preventing disease or detecting it in an asymptomatic stage.” In other words, HB is an individually approved, socially appraised, and medically recommended action voluntarily undertaken by a person who believes himself or herself to be healthy that tends to prevent the occurrence of an undesirable health condition or detect it in an asymptomatic stage (Alonzo <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">1993</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Alonzo, A.A.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. The critical issue in the definition is that the individual perceives himself or herself to be healthy and carries out certain modalities to avert the occurrence of ill-health. This is why HB is the same as PHB.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Closely related to HB is protective health behaviour<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Protective health behaviour</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, which is defined as “any behaviour performed by a person, regardless of his or her perceived or actual health status, in order to protect, promote, or maintain his or her health, whether or not such behaviour is objectively effective toward that end” (Harris and Guten <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">1979</CitationRef>, p. 18)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            <IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Guten, S.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. In this case, action is performed regardless of the health status of the individual. This implies that an individual may have perceived good health or not. Whether HB or protective health behaviour, one common ground is that it is a form of behaviour regarding personal health among individuals. Such behaviour may be objectively effective or not. This mostly happens as a result of lack of knowledge about appropriate medically recommended preventive health practices. For instance, use of appropriate malaria<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Malaria</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> preventive measures is still low in many malaria endemic countries (Karanja et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR33">2002</CitationRef>, Amzat <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Primary>Karanja, J.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Invariably, medical sociology is immersed in showing patterns of behaviour whether effective or not in prevention and disease control. In either case, there could be intervention to intensify the effective behaviour or change the ineffective behaviour<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Primary>Secondary prevention</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> (also called health maintenance) involves perception of the possibility of ill-health and resultant activities to arrest the disease process and restore health. This involves various detection activities such as HIV testing and other forms of screening aimed at detecting what could be wrong. One of the aims of health maintenance<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Health maintenance</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is to avoid pathological damages and deter the communicability of infectious disease. At this stage, the individual implements action necessary to identify specific illnesses or conditions at an early stage and seeks professional help for prompt intervention to prevent or limit disability. The third stage is tertiary prevention<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Tertiary prevention</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, which aims at reducing the negative impact of established disease by restoring function and reducing disease-related complications (Sosa-Estani et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR61">2012</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Sosa-Estani, S.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. This is the stage of recuperation (after adequate treatment). At the stage, an individual is expected to comply/adhere with a therapeutic regimen. The goal of this stage is to prevent complications, further damages, and pain from the disease. The essence of tertiary prevention is to regain health and resume functional roles. In cases of chronic diseases, this stage involves a positive living with the condition.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Health behaviour interventions often focus on individuals at high risk (or high risk groups [HRG]) and risk behaviours<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            <IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>High risk group (HRG)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. The HRG includes those individuals who, as a result of their social conditions and biological attributes, are exposed to certain diseases in the society. Heinemann et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">2012</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Heinemann, L.</Primary>

            </IndexTerm> them in a cohort of the population that is more likely to develop a particular health problem or disease than the rest of the population. Risk does not automatically translate to development of a disease condition. Risk is often combined with exposure for a disease to occur. For instance, Heinemann et al. further observed that risk has three major categories in cardiovascular disease. The first category includes somatic factors, which mainly include body characteristics such as blood pressure and body weight. The second includes behavioural factors such as smoking, poor nutrition, lack of physical exercise, high alcohol consumption, and drug abuse. The third are strains including exposure in the occupational, social, and private spheres. The second and the third factors are of utmost importance in this discussion—how behavioural patterns and structural factors put an individual at risk of certain disease conditions.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In addition, some diseases have defined risk groups such as kwashiorkor among children. Due to a high level of poverty<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Para TextBreak="No">In the case of malaria in Africa, certain groups have been identified to have a high risk of contracting malaria. The most vulnerable group is children under five years old. WHO (<CitationRef CitationID="CR75">2012</CitationRef>) has observed that young children stand a high risk of malaria infection and are vulnerable to severe malaria disease when infected; 85 % of all malaria deaths occur in children in Africa (WHO <CitationRef CitationID="CR75">2012</CitationRef>). The under-five children are yet to develop protective levels of immunity against malaria parasites. Pregnant women are also vulnerable because the immunity of women is impaired during pregnancy<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Pregnancy</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Low birth weight and severe anaemia are common results of malaria in pregnancy. It has been noted that poverty breeds malaria and malaria impoverishes people and the society due to the amount of household income devoted to malaria prevention and treatment.</Para>

            </IndexTerm> where there is standing water. Because of the poor housing facilities, there might be poor sanitation facilities in most poor households. Most windows and doors might not be screened to prevent mosquitoes from entering the home. The poor usually have little or no access to information and education about public health<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Public health</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. They might not have basic knowledge of ITN or available drugs. Therefore, they continue to engage in risk behaviour. Most of the available treatment and preventive measures may also not be affordable to them. Refugees (or internally displaced persons) and migrants or seasonal workers who move from malaria-free areas to malaria-endemic ones are also at greater risk because they have inadequate protective immunity. This is why travelers, especially those coming from malaria-free areas, need to take medical precautions when entering malaria-endemic areas.</Para>

Apart from famine, poor nutrition also involves intake of an inappropriately balanced diet. This may also be a result of poverty. More than 41 % of people in sub-Saharan Africa live on less than $ 1 per day, and 32 % is undernourished (Hunger Project <CitationRef CitationID="CR68">2012</CitationRef>). Most people consume food but without adequate calories or nutrients for good health. This is why there is a high prevalence of childhood<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Heading>Towards a Definition of Illness Behaviour</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Illness behaviour is a concept that was introduced in the late 1950s by David Mechanic to depict the “variability in reactions to symptoms and illness, and to identify the various socio-cultural, environmental and psychological factors that affect such reactions” (Mechanic <CitationRef CitationID="CR45">1995</CitationRef>, p. 1208)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Mechanic, D.</Primary>

              <Primary>Illness behaviour</Primary>
              <Secondary>definition</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm>. Illness behaviour is further conceived as “the varying ways individuals respond to bodily indications, how they monitor internal states, define and interpret symptoms, make attributions, take remedial actions and utilise various sources of informal and formal care” (Mechanic <CitationRef CitationID="CR45">1962</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR46">1995</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Mechanic, D.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Inaction is also a form of response to illness. One major difference between health and illness behaviour is that in the former, the person defines himself or herself as healthy and tries to maintain his/her health status or detect if there could be anything wrong, while in the latter, the person defines himself/herself as ill and tries to find ways of recuperating. In other words, illness behaviour is the way an individual believing himself or herself to be ill interprets and responds to signs and symptoms in order to achieve wellness.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Invariably, there is a health problem or condition affecting the individual. Some may require prompt care, especially in the case of acute diseases. The lived experience of illness and desire to restore health are often a personal responsibility of the individual. This is because an individual has the liberty to take action that is deemed efficacious. Meanwhile, there are four basic questions an individual needs to answer in a case of illness. For those underage, the question will be answered by caretakers. The questions include the “what, where, when, and how.”</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Determination of what is wrong and what measures should be applied are the two critical starting points. A person defines what is wrong by assessing the symptoms through the nature of illness experience and bodily indications. The feeling of pain and discomfort provides the cues for the individual to define what might be wrong or relate the experience to significant others<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Significant others</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> or caregivers. The local or personal understanding forms the basis for the definition of the symptoms. Before contact with any caregiver, there are various personal appraisals which could determine the need to seek care from other domains or use certain measures at an informal level.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The foregoing leads us to the second question, which is <Emphasis Type="Italic">where</Emphasis> care can be obtained. When there are several options, an individual needs to weigh various possibilities and opportunities. Despite the availability of different providers, there are also opportunities at informal levels. In most developing countries, there is a possibility of informal consultation with significant others or agents (e.g., patent medicine sellers) at an informal level. It is also possible to obtain over-the-counter<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Para TextBreak="No">The next question deals with when the measure will be obtained. An individual needs to decide when to seek help from any caregiver. Early treatment is often advocated. Unfortunately, most disease conditions develop complications before many seek professional medical care. The question of “when” is often critical in chronic diseases. In the acute form or after an accident<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Accidents</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, a decision is often made very quickly. Some acute illnesses (e.g., medical emergencies) are thought to produce expedient care-seeking devoid of any prolonged social process (Alonzo <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">1980</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

One of the major observations is that health-seeking behaviour hinges on the ability of an individual to correctly recognise the illness in terms of perceived causes and symptoms. Beliefs about the aetiology of illnesses also invariably dictate the type of therapies and healers to be consulted. General research in the area of treatment seeking has documented that this is related to sociocultural beliefs about the cause and cure of illness (Mwenesi et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR50">1995</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The major issue is that treatment is initiated based on illness definition, availability of care providers, and other intervening variables.

It was observed that the magnitude of the relationship between education and health varies across conditions, but it is generally large.

Most lifestyle-related medical conditions are relatively lower among children while some diseases are related to old age. The guardians take most decisions on health behaviour on behalf of the school-age children. The youth takes self-responsibility of health and often engage in risky behaviours like smoking and alcohol consumption. More so, health and illness behaviours have been observed to be socially and culturally acquired from childhood<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

This may simply be explained as the location of an individual or the nature of the space for daily living. For instance, most people in rural Africa often use traditional medicine<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

For example, types of food stores and restaurants influence food choices and, subsequently, diet-related health outcomes (Morland and Evenson <CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2009</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                <Primary>Neighbourhood</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> also put individuals at high risk of such diseases. Individuals in malaria-endemic areas are at a greatest risk of contracting malaria. In addition, the level of infrastructural facilities (leisure, water, transportation, power, and sanitation) in the locality can influence health indicators (Sarkar et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR57">2013</CitationRef>; Stoler et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR63">2012</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>. It is not all negative. The built environment of disadvantaged neighbourhoods, which account for limited access to motor vehicles, increases walking for transport and may reduce sedentary lifestyle, thereby reducing the risk of certain chronic disease (Turrell et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR69">2013</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Turrell, G.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. In addition, another study shows that the existence of “social traps or dangers” in the neighbourhood also affects livelihood. Fear of crime and perception of neighbourhood safety can also influence social activities and propensity to certain injuries (physical and psychological) (Carver et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2008</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Carver, A.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Invariably, geographical space and associated spatial processes often influence access to basic facilities of life and exposure to health risks, which can influence the population health and health-seeking behaviours.</Para>
