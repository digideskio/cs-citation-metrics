The system has been evaluated in applications to monitored burns and a long-range smoke event detected by the regional PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> monitoring network in Southeastern USA. Uncertainties in the estimation of emissions have been identified and sensitivities of predicted PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> levels to smoke injection height versus PBL height, and wind speed and direction have been quantified.

              <Para>Prescribed burning (PB) is an economical way of maintaining the forest ecosystem and reducing wildfire risk. However, pollutants emitted from the burns may contribute to air quality problems in downwind urban areas. An example of this happened in Atlanta, Georgia on 28 February 2007 when two burns ignited in the morning 80 km upwind led to 150 μg m<Superscript>3</Superscript> PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> concentrations citywide in the evening. To continue PB operations without violating ambient air quality standards, it is extremely important to be able to accurately predict the impacts of the burns. The objective of this research was to develop such a prediction system that can be used by land managers for conducting PB under favorable air quality conditions.</Para>

              <Heading>Modeling System</Heading>
              <Para>The prediction system consists of models for estimation of emissions, and prediction of meteorology, dispersions of smoke plumes, their long-range transport and chemical interactions with the background atmosphere. Emissions estimation starts with the estimation of fuel loads, in mass per unit area of the burn plot, for the fuel types (e.g., duff, litter, green and woody fuels) defined in the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS). For this, the pictures that look most like the burn plot are chosen from a photo-series and the loads associated with these pictures in a catalogue are weighted to obtain a best estimate. The next step is to estimate the fuel consumption using CONSUME. This model calculates the amount of fuel consumption under different fire conditions. One of the most important determinants of consumption is fuel moisture. Finally, total emissions are estimated using emission factors (EFs) defined as mass of pollutant emitted per unit mass of fuel consumed. The EFs used here are based on field measurements [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00878">8</CitationRef>]. For the type of fuels concerned here, the difference between the PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> EF used here and the EF derived from burns simulated in a laboratory [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00874">4</CitationRef>] is less than 10 %.</Para>
              <Para>The temporal distribution of burn emissions are estimated by Rabbit Rules, a free-agent cellular automata model [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00871">1</CitationRef>]. Given a description of the fuel distribution/density over the burn plot, which can be obtained from satellite imagery, along with an ignition pattern, this model simulates fire progression over the burn plot. Ignition is performed typically by helicopter or all-terrain vehicles, starting from the downwind edge of the plot to keep the fire under control and following lateral stripes towards the upwind edge. Rabbit Rules computes the intensities of fire induced drafts converging towards the flames and the resulting pressure fields. Around low pressure zones, smoke organizes into updraft cores the number of which is important for plume rise calculations in the dispersion model, as fewer cores would result in higher plumes. Rabbit Rules also computes the diameter of the cores and their updraft velocities.</Para>
              <Para>The meteorological variables needed to model the dispersion and transport of the smoke plume (ambient pressure, temperature, humidity and wind fields) are calculated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00876">6</CitationRef>]. The dispersion of the smoke in the near-field is modeled by Daysmoke, empirical model specifically designed for prescribed burn plumes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00872">2</CitationRef>]. Given the number of updraft cores, core diameters, updraft velocities, plume and ambient temperatures, wind fields, and emission rates, Daysmoke tracks the particles up to a predetermined distance from the burn plot, assuming the smoke is an inert substance. Long-range transport and chemistry are modeled by AG-CMAQ, an adaptive grid regional air quality model that can dynamically refine the grid around the plume [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00875">5</CitationRef>]. In this prediction system, Daysmoke has been coupled with AG-CMAQ as a subgrid-scale plume model through a process called <Emphasis Type="Italic">handover</Emphasis>. With this process, the plume is transferred from Daysmoke to AG-CMAQ at an optimal downwind distance with minimum loss of accuracy in smoke concentrations.</Para>

              <Heading>Model Evaluation</Heading>
              <Para>A comprehensive field study was conducted at a military base on Florida’s Gulf of Mexico coast to collect data for evaluating the modeling system. As part of this study, the fuels were measured both before and after the burn [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00877">7</CitationRef>]. Emissions of CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> and PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> were measured with a platform mounted on a tethered aerostat [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00873">3</CitationRef>]. Winds were measured with a Doppler sodar, airborne (mounted on the aerostat) and ground-based sonic anemometers, and piball soundings. Plume height was measured with a lidar ceilometer. Ground-level PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> was also measured, both with fixed and mobile platforms.</Para>
              <Para>Comparison to measurements reveled that although both fuel loads and consumptions were overestimated, by 20 and 10 % respectively, total emissions were underestimated by 15 %. Low wind speeds (WS) and varying wind directions (WD), particularly during transition from land to sea breeze, were difficult to predict with WRF. For sustained and steady wind periods, typical WS errors were 10–30 % and WD errors were 10–20° at altitudes most relevant to plume transport. Predicted plume heights were in agreement with the ceilometers measurements during initial flaming stages of the burns but modeled plumes collapsed faster. The agreement of predicted ground-level concentrations with observations varied; typically there was better agreement near the burn plot and the differences grew with downwind distance (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00871">87.1</InternalRef>). <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00871">

              <Para>Long-range impacts of PB were evaluated by simulating the Atlanta smoke event. Predicted peak PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> concentrations were about 70 μg m<Superscript>−3</Superscript> lower than the observations. The reasons for this under prediction were investigated through a sensitivity analysis. The model predictions can be raised to the level of observations by increasing the emissions by a factor of 4–6. However, based on the evaluation of emission estimates with field measurements, such a level of increase is not acceptable. On the other hand, vertical redistribution of emissions may be justified since the plume height is subject to uncertainties. The sensitivities of PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> concentrations to PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> emissions injected into different CMAQ layers at different times were calculated. The sensitivity of peak PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> concentrations in Atlanta to emissions injected into the PBL was 0.5 μg m<Superscript>−3</Superscript> ton<Superscript>−1</Superscript> at 20:00 GMT, the most sensitive time for emissions. Modeled PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> peaks would increase if the emissions penetrating into the free troposphere were redistributed into the PBL. However, the maximum increase that can be achieved in this manner is estimated to be less than 5 μg m<Superscript>−3</Superscript>. Allocating a greater fraction of emissions to 20:00 GMT would increase the peak also but its effect would be small for a realistic increment.</Para>
              <Para>WS and WD are the two other parameters that were analyzed for their contribution to PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> concentrations. The Atlanta smoke event was dominated by strong and steady southeasterly winds and WD was predicted more accurately than what is typically achievable by meteorological models. However, sensitivity to WD is very large as ±10° rotation of the wind field would make the plume totally miss Atlanta. Reducing WD, in this case making it more easterly, by 5° resulted in 15 μg m<Superscript>−3</Superscript> increase in peak PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> concentrations but advanced the time of the peak by 1 h. WS proved to be the most important parameter for prediction of peak concentrations. Reducing WS by 30 % increased the modeled PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> peaks in Atlanta by 50 μg m<Superscript>−3</Superscript>. Also, it delayed the time of the peak by 1 h. Therefore, combined with −5° adjustment of WD, 30 % reduction of WS would make modeled peaks match the magnitude and timing of observed peaks. But, do such adjustments of WS and WD have any basis? When compared to the most proximate sounding at Peachtree City, midway between the burn locations and Atlanta, WRF-predicted WD and WS are respectively 7–12° more southerly and about 30 % larger than the observations at the most relevant altitudes; hence, the adjustments are justified.</Para>

              <Para>The modeling system developed incorporate new elements for emission, dispersion and transport processes that are critical for accurate prediction of the air quality impacts of PB plumes. These elements were evaluated using field data and their sources of uncertainty were identified. Uncertainties in emission strength and plume injection height are significant but their contributions to the under prediction of long-range PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> concentrations are relatively small. Uncertainties in WS and WD remain to be the limiting factors. With more accurate wind predictions, the system can be a viable tool for dynamic management of PB operations.</Para>
