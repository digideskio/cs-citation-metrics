          <Heading>Marine Parks</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">A marine park is a park consisting of an area of sea (or lake) sometimes protected for recreational use, but more often set aside to preserve a specific habitat and ensure the ecosystem is sustained for the organisms that exist there. Most marine parks are designed by government and organised like ‘watery’ national parks. The largest marine park is the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia, at 350,000 km<Superscript>2</Superscript>. Although for many uses it is sufficient to designate the boundaries of the marine park and to inform commercial fishing boats and other maritime enterprises, some parks have gone to additional effort to make their wonders accessible to visitors. These can range from glass-bottomed boats and small submarines to windowed undersea tubes. In New Zealand a marine reserve is an area which has a higher degree of legal protection than marine parks for conservation purposes. In New South Wales, there are planned marine parks which will stretch along the coastline of the entire state.</Para>

          <Heading>Wildlife Sanctuaries</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">India is home to several fabulous wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, which makes this country a nature lover’s paradise. The wildlife sanctuaries in India are home to around 2,000 different species of birds, 3,500 species of mammals, nearly 30,000 different kinds of insects and more than 15,000 varieties of plants. Travellers from all across the globe come to India to take a look at its rich wildlife and natural vegetation.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">There are as many as 80 national parks and over 441 wildlife sanctuaries in India, covering nearly 4.5% of the total geographical area of the country. Scattered all across the country, these sanctuaries and parks attract the tourists with their beautiful landscapes, amazing rock formation and diverse range of flora and fauna. Most of these sanctuaries were originally private hunting grounds of the former Indian aristocratic families.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Paying a visit to India’s wildlife sanctuaries is something that one should not rule out when on a holiday to this country. These sanctuaries and forest reserves are home to several endangered species of animals and birds like the Asiatic Elephant, the Royal Bengal tiger, the Snow Leopard and the Siberian Crane. Many of the forest reserves and wildlife sanctuaries of India are famous for some particular species of animals. For instance, the Kaziranga in Assam is known for the Indian Rhinoceros, while Periyar in Kerala is famous for its elephants. While embarking on a wildlife tour, travellers can pay a visit to the national parks in India. The Jim Corbett National Park, which is located in the Himalayan foothills, is the first of its kind. The Dudhwa National Park is another park famous by its huge swamp deer population. Tiger reserves are the best places to catch a glimpse of this big cat. The Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh is one of the largest tiger reserves of India.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The wildlife sanctuaries of India also include the bird sanctuaries, like the one at Bharatpur in Madhya Pradesh. The different species of birds that one can find over here is truly fascinating. Great Indian Bustard, Himalayan Monal Pheasant, Lammergeiers, Choughs, White-bellied Sea Eagle, White-breasted Swiftlet, Fruit Pigeons and Griffon Vultures are some of the bird species one gets to see here.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">A trip to the wildlife sanctuaries in India brings one close to nature. The quiet and peaceful atmosphere of these parks can be enjoyed while walking down the trails or past the tall trees. A large number of wildlife safari tours are available which one can avail of in order to check out these wildlife sanctuaries.</Para>

          <Heading>Marine Protected Area</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Marine protected areas, like any protected area, are regions in which human activity has been placed under some restrictions in the interest of conserving the natural environment, it’s surrounding waters and the occupant ecosystems, and any cultural or historical resources that may require preservation or management. Marine protected areas’ boundaries will include some area of ocean, even if it is only a small fraction of the total area of the territory.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Natural or historic marine resources are protected by local, state, territorial, native, regional or national authorities and may differ substantially from nation to nation. This variation includes different limitations on development, fishing practices, fishing seasons and catch limits, moorings and bans on removing or disrupting marine life of any kind.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In some situations, MPAs also provide revenue for countries, often of equal size as the income that they would have if they were to grant companies permissions to fish. As of 2010, the world hosted more than 6,800 MPAs, encompassing 1.17% of the world’s oceans (‘Global Ocean Protection: Present Status and Future Possibilities’. Iucn.org. <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2010</CitationRef>-11-23).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Marine protected areas are included on the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), since 2010, is viewable via Protected Planet, an online interactive search engine hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme’s World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC).</Para>
          <Section2 ID="Sec4">
            <Heading>Protected Areas</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Protected areas are locations which receive protection because of their recognised natural, ecological and/or cultural values. There are several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level of protection depending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the international organisations involved. The term ‘protected area’ also includes marine protected areas, the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean. There are over 161,000 protected areas in the world (as of October 2010) with more added daily, representing over 13% of the world’s land surface area. By contrast, only 1.17% of the world’s oceans is included in the world’s ~6,800 marine protected areas.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Protected areas are essential for biodiversity conservation. They are the cornerstones of virtually all national and international conservation strategies. They are areas set aside to maintain functioning natural ecosystems, to act as refuges for species and to maintain ecological processes that cannot survive in most intensely managed landscapes and seascapes. Protected areas act as benchmarks against which we understand human interactions with the natural world. Today they are often the only hope we have of stopping many threatened or endemic species from becoming extinct.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Protected areas are designated with the objective of conserving biodiversity and providing an indicator for that conservation’s progress, but the extent to which they defend resources and ecosystem dynamics from degradation are slightly more complex. Protected areas will usually encompass several other zones that have been deemed important for particular conservation uses, such as Important Bird Areas (IBA) and Endemic Bird Areas (EBA), Centres of Plant Diversity (CBD), Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas (ICCA), Alliance for Zero Extinction Sites (AZE) and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA). Likewise, a protected area or an entire network of protected areas may lie within a larger geographic zone that is recognised as a terrestrial or marine ecoregions, or a crisis ecoregions, for example.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Subsequently, the range of natural resources that any one protected area may guard is vast. They are allocated primarily for species conservation whether it be flora or fauna or the relationship between them. Protected areas are similarly important for conserving sites of cultural or indigenous importance and considerable reserves of natural resources.</Para>

            <Heading>Carbon Stocks</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Carbon emissions from deforestation account for an estimated 20% of global carbon emissions, so in protecting the worlds carbon stocks greenhouse gas emissions are reduced and long-term land cover change is prevented, which is an effective strategy in the struggle against global warming. Of all global terrestrial carbon stock, 15.2% is contained within protected areas. Protected areas in South America hold 27% of the world’s carbon stock, which is the highest percentage of any country in both absolute terms and as a proportion of the total stock.</Para>

          <Section2 ID="Sec6">
            <Heading>Rainforests</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">18.8% of the world’s forest is covered by protected areas, and 16 of the 20 forest types have 10% or more protected area coverage. Of the 670 ecoregions with forest cover, 54% have 10% or more of their forest cover protected under IUCN Categories I–VI.</Para>

          <Section2 ID="Sec7">
            <Heading>Mountains</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Nationally designated protected areas cover 14.3% of the world’s mountain areas, and these mountainous protected areas make up 32.5% of the world’s total terrestrial protected area coverage in 2009. Mountain protected area coverage has increased globally by 21% since 1990, and out of the 198 countries with mountain areas, 43.9% still have less than 10% of their mountain areas protected.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Annual updates on each of these analyses are made in order to make comparisons to the Millennium Development Goals and several other fields of analysis are expected to be introduced in the monitoring of protected areas management effectiveness, such as freshwater and marine or coastal studies which are currently under way, and islands and drylands which are currently in planning.</Para>

        <Section1 ID="Sec8">
          <Heading>IUCN Protected Area Management Categories</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Through its World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA), IUCN have developed six Protected Area Management Categories that define protected areas according to their management objectives which are internationally recognised by various national governments and the United Nations. The categories provide international standards for defining protected areas and encourage conservation planning according to their management aims.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Recently, the importance of protected areas has been brought to the forefront at the threat of human-induced global warming and the understanding of the necessity to consume natural resources in a sustainable manner. The spectrum of benefits and values of protected areas is recognised not only ecologically, but culturally through further development in the arena of Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas (ICCAs). International programmes for the protection of representative ecosystems remain relatively progressive, with less advances in marine and freshwater biomes.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Enforcing protected area boundaries is a costly and expensive, particularly if the allocation of a new protected region places new restrictions on the use of resources by the native people which may lead to their subsequent displacement. This has troubled relationships between conservationists and rural communities in many protected regions and is often why many wildlife reserves and national parks face the human threat of poaching for the illegal bush meat or trophy trades which is resorted to as an alternative form. How to manage areas protected for conservation brings up a range of challenges—whether it be regarding the local population, specific ecosystems or the design of the reserve itself—and because of the many unpredictable elements in ecology issues, each protected area requires a case specific set of guidelines.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">There is an increasing and justifiable pressure to take proper account of human needs when setting up protected areas, and these sometimes have to be ‘traded off’ against conservation needs. Previously the government made decisions about protected areas and informed local people afterwards; today the emphasis is towards shifting the greater discussions with stakeholders and joint decisions about how such lands should be set aside and managed. Such negotiations are never easy but usually produce stronger and longer-lasting results for both conservation and people. In some countries, protected areas can be assigned without the infrastructure and networking needed to substitute consumable resources and protect the area from development or misuse. The soliciting of protected areas may require regulation to the level of meeting demands for food, feed, livestock and fuel, and the legal enforcement of not only the protected area itself but also ‘buffer zones’ surrounding it, which may help to resist destabilisation.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">The coastline or seashore is where the land meets the sea or ocean. A precise line that can be called a coastline cannot be determined due to the dynamic nature of tides. The term ‘coastal zone’ can be used instead, which is a spatial zone where interaction of the sea and land processes occurs. Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to describe a geographic location or region, for example, New Zealand’s West Coast, or the East and West Coasts of the United States. A pelagic coast refers to a coast which fronts the open ocean, as opposed to a more sheltered coast in a gulf or bay. A shore, on the other hand, can refer to parts of the land which adjoin any large body of water, including oceans (seashore) and lakes (lakeshore). Similarly, the somewhat related term ‘bank’ refers to the land alongside or sloping down to a river (riverbank) or to a body of water smaller than a lake. ‘Bank’ is also used in some parts of the world to refer to an artificial ridge of earth intended to retain the water of a river or pond. In other places this may be called a levee. While many scientific experts might agree on a common definition of the term ‘coast’, the delineation of the extents of a coast differ according to jurisdiction, with many scientific and government authorities in various countries differing for economic and social policy reasons.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Basically coasts are just beautiful tides which determine the range over which sediment is deposited or eroded. Areas with high tidal ranges allow waves to reach farther up the shore, and areas with lower tidal ranges produce deposition at a smaller elevation interval. The tidal range is influenced by the size and shape of the coastline. Tides do not typically cause erosion by themselves; however, tidal bores can erode as the waves surge up river estuaries from the ocean. Sediment deposited by rivers is the dominant influence on the amount of sediment located on a coastline. Today riverine deposition at the coast is often blocked by dams and other human regulatory devices, which remove the sediment from the stream by causing it to be deposited inland. Like the ocean which shapes them, coasts are a dynamic environment with constant change. The Earth’s natural processes, particularly sea level rises, waves and various weather phenomena, have resulted in the erosion, accretion and reshaping of coasts as well as flooding and creation of continental shelves and drowned river valleys (rias).

          <Para TextBreak="No">Waves erode coastline as they break on shore releasing their energy; the larger the wave, the more energy it releases and the more sediment it moves. Coastlines with longer shores have more room for the waves to disperse their energy, while coasts with cliffs and short shore faces give little room for the wave energy to be dispersed. In these areas the wave energy breaking against the cliffs is higher, and air and water are compressed into cracks in the rock, forcing the rock apart, breaking it down. Sediment deposited by waves comes from eroded cliff faces and is moved along the coastline by the waves.

The coast and its adjacent areas on and off shore is an important part of a local ecosystem as the mixture of freshwater and saltwater in estuaries provides many nutrients for marine life. Salt marshes and beaches also support a diversity of plants, animals and insects crucial to the food chain. The high level of biodiversity creates a high level of biological activity, which has attracted human activity for thousands of years.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Once a fishing port, the harbour is now dedicated to tourism and pleasure boating. It can be seen that the sand and rocks have been darkened by oil slick up to the high-water line. An increasing part the global population inhabits coastal regions (Goudarzi <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2006</CitationRef>). Many of the world’s major cities have been built on or near good harbours and have port facilities. Jurisdictions that are landlocked have achieved port status by such measures such as building canals. The coast is a crucial frontier that nations typically defended against military invaders, smugglers and illegal migrants. Fixed coastal defences have long been erected in many nations, and coastal countries typically have a navy and some form of coast guard. Coasts, especially those with beaches and warm water are an important draw for tourists. In many island nations such as those of the Mediterranean, South Pacific and Caribbean, tourism is central to the economy. Coasts are popular destinations because of recreational activities such as swimming, fishing, surfing, boating and sunbathing. Growth management can be a challenge for coastal local authorities who often struggle to provide the infrastructure required by new residents.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Coasts also face many environmental challenges relating to human-induced impacts. The human influence on climate change is thought to be a contributing factor of an accelerated trend in sea level rise which threatens coastal habitat. Pollution can occur from a number of sources: garbage and industrial debris, the transportation of petroleum in tankers, increasing the probability of large oil spills and small oil spills created by large and small vessels, which flush bilge water into the ocean. Fishing has diminished due to habitat degradation, overfishing, trawling, bycatch and climate change. Since the growth of global fishing enterprises after the 1950s, intensive fishing has gone from a few concentrated areas to encompass nearly all fisheries. The scraping of the ocean floor in bottom dragging is devastating to coral, sponges and other long-lived species that do not recover quickly. This destruction alters the functioning of the ecosystem and can permanently alter species composition and biodiversity. Bycatch, the capture of unintended species in the course of fishing, is typically returned the ocean only to die from injuries or exposure. Bycatch represents approximately one-fourth of all marine catch. In the case of shrimp capture, the bycatch is five times larger than the shrimp caught.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Extraordinary population growth in the twentieth century has placed stress on the planet’s ecosystems. For example, on Saint Lucia, harvesting mangrove for timber and clearing for fishing drove the mangrove forests to low levels, resulting in a loss of habitat and spawning ground for marine life that was unique to the area. These forests also helped to stabilise the coastline. Conservation efforts since the 1980s have partially restored the ecosystem.</Para>

            <Heading>Types of Coast</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">According to one principle of classification, an emergent coastline is a coastline which has experienced a fall in sea level, because of either a global sea level change or local uplift. Emergent coastlines are identifiable by the coastal landforms, which are above the high tide mark, such as raised beaches. Alternatively, a submergent coastline is a coastline which has experienced a rise in sea level, due to a global sea level change, local subsidence or isostatic rebound. Submergent coastlines are identifiable by their submerged, or ‘drowned’ landforms, and fjords.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">According to a second principle of classification, a concordant coastline is a coastline where bands of different rock types run parallel to the shore. These rock types are usually of alternating resistance, so the coastline forms distinctive landforms, such as coves. A discordant coastline is a type of coastline formed when rock types of alternating resistance run perpendicular to the shore. Discordant coastlines feature distinctive landforms because the rocks are eroded by ocean waves. The less resistant rocks erode faster, creating inlets or bays; the more resistant rocks erode more slowly, remaining as headlands or outcroppings.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Animals living along the coast vary enormously; some live along coasts to nest like puffins, sea turtles and rockhopper penguins. Sea snails and various kinds of barnacles live on the coast and scavenge on food deposited by the sea. Most coastal animals are used to humans in developed areas, such as dolphins and seagulls who eat food thrown for them by tourists. Since the coastal areas are all part of the littoral zone, there is a profusion of marine life found just off-coast. There are many kinds of seabirds on the coast. Pelicans and cormorants join up with terns and oystercatchers to forage for fish and shellfish on the coast. There are also sea lions on the coast of Wales and other countries. Coastal areas are famous for their kelp beds. Kelp is a fast-growing seaweed that grows up to a metre a day. Corals and anemones are true animals but live a similar lifestyle as plants do. Mangroves and salt marsh are important coastal vegetation types in topical and temperate environments respectively.</Para>

            <Heading>The Coastline Problem</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">At some time in the years immediately preceding 1951, Lewis Fry Richardson in researching the possible effect of border lengths on the probability of war noticed that the Portuguese reported their measured border with Spain to be 987 km, but the Spanish reported it to be 1,214 km. This was the beginning of the coastline problem, which is how to arrive at an estimate of a boundary that is infinite.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Richardson’s belief was based on Euclidean geometry that a coastline would approach a fixed length, as do similar estimations of regular geometric figures. For example, the perimeter of a regular polygon inscribed in a circle approaches the circumference with increasing numbers of sides (and decrease in the length of one side). In geometric measure theory such a smooth curve as the circle that can be approximated by small straight segments with a definite limit is termed a rectifiable curve.</Para>

            <Heading>Describing a Coastline</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">More than a decade after Richardson’s work was finished, Benoît Mandelbrot invented a new branch of mathematics, fractal geometry, to describe just such non-rectifiable complexes in nature as the infinite coastline. A key property of the fractal is self-similarity; that is, at any scale the same general configuration appears. A coastline is perceived as bays alternating with promontories. No matter how greatly any one small section of coastline is magnified, a similar pattern of bays and promontories on bays and promontories appears, right down to the grains of sand. At that scale the coastline appears as a momentarily shifting, potentially infinitely long thread with a stochastic arrangement of bays and promontories formed from the small objects at hand. In such a real environment Mandelbrot asserts, ‘coastline length turns out to be an elusive notion that slips between the fingers of those who want to grasp it’.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">A coastline is definitely represented by a fractal. However, there are different kinds of fractals. A coastline is in ‘a first category of fractals, namely curves whose fractal dimension is greater than 1’. That last statement represents an extension by Mandelbrot of Richardson’s thought.
