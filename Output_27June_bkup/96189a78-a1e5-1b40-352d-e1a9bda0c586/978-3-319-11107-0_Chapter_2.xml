            <Heading>Surgical Leadership in a Time of Change</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par2" TextBreak="No">Surgery currently holds a central place in the complex American health care system, but change is everywhere. Approximately 100 million procedures are performed annually by 275,000 surgical specialists. Surgical services are expensive, costing $500 billion each year, and operative procedures are uniquely remunerative to hospitals, typically accounting for 40Â % of hospital revenue. The technical aspects of surgical practice have evolved very rapidly in the two decades since the widespread adoption of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic approaches have supplanted most open operations, now joined by thoracoscopy, endovascular therapy, and image-guided surgery. Scientific advances have also changed the intellectual underpinnings of surgical practice. Insights into the structure and function of the human genome are reflected in personalized medicine, to be joined shortly by personalized surgical therapy. Restrictions on postgraduate training hours, beginning in 2002, have fundamentally altered surgical training, positively and negatively.</Para>

            <Heading>The Leadership Imperative</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par8" TextBreak="No">As a first step in considering surgical leadership, it is important to consider the activities with which surgeons are engaged, and then to ask how these tasks promote leadership.</Para>
            <Section2 ID="Sec3">
              <Heading>The Clinical Mission</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par9" TextBreak="No">Surgeons express the clinical mission in care of individual patients and health systems are organized to facilitate the provision of operative care. Operating room suites are central physical features of every hospital in this country. Operating room construction is highly regulated and uniquely expensive, making disproportionate claims on hospital capital and operating funds. Personnel requirements exceed those of other areas of hospital operations, magnified by the 24/7 nature of surgical activity at most large hospitals. In addition, operating room functions make large demands upon other services, including radiology, blood banking, and pathology. In many systems, ambulatory clinics and emergency rooms are explicitly designed to efficiently funnel patients to surgical providers.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par10" TextBreak="No">Within this system, surgeons have possessed unique degrees of personal autonomy and flexibility. Anesthesiologists, operating room nurses and surgical support personnel are assigned to a daily surgical schedule and are committed to finishing the cases presented. With many fewer constraints, surgeons may schedule elective operations at their discretion and in ways that maximize professional gain while minimizing personal conflicts. Surgeons are allowed greater degrees of freedom in equipment and supply requests than other physicians. For example, most operating rooms maintain an extensive list of âdoctor preference cardsâ that outline the needs of each surgeon for commonly performed operations, the cards often substantially different for operations that are largely similar. Even though operating room personnel are highly skilled and expensive, surgery does not begin until the surgeon is ready. As these few examples illustrate, the operating room is a highly artificial environment designed to maximize productivity of surgeons. Unfortunately, these hierarchical aspects of surgical care, long part of surgical culture, are not conducive to leadership development. Moreover, this surgeon-centric model of practice is vanishing, as are autocratic forms of surgical leadership so common in the past.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par11" TextBreak="No">Within the operating room, the importance of communication and interpersonal relationship has been recognized in recent years through team-building efforts. Surgical checklists, pre-incision time outs and postoperative debriefing are all expressions of the same incredibly simple, but powerful idea: every member of a surgical team has unique insights and value is gained by sharing information. The results have been impressive. As reported by de Vries and colleagues, the institution of a multidisciplinary surgical safety checklist, including medications, marking of the operative site and postoperative instructions significantly improved operative results [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. The number of complications per 100 patients decreased from 27 to 17 and the rate of complications decreased by one-third. Astoundingly, this simple intervention cut in-hospital mortality from 1.5 to 0.8Â %, almost by half. Similar results were reported by the Safe Surgery Saves Lives Study Group [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par12" TextBreak="No">Surgical care is now multidisciplinary care. Long the domain of surgical oncologists and transplant surgeons, multidisciplinary clinics and case conferences increasingly dominate cardiovascular surgery, bariatric surgery, pediatric surgery, and many other disciplines. Success in multidisciplinary settings requires the practitioner to be knowledgeable of the othersâ disciplines, to appreciate and respect alternative perspectives, to resolve ambiguity and to engage in multilateral negotiation. These attributes are precisely the characteristics required for modern surgical leadership.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par13" TextBreak="No">Surgical leaders must interpret the demands of surgery to others. Provision of surgical care is resource and capital intensive and may conflict with other health system demands. For example, in hospitals with high occupancy, admissions from the emergency department may compete for beds devoted to elective surgical cases. The recently-enacted Affordable Care Act shifts financial risk progressively to health systems and may convert surgical services from revenue generating units to cost centers. Future bundled payments will require substantial internal readjustments. The interpersonal skills exemplified by multidisciplinary care are directly relevant to navigating these coming changes.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par14" TextBreak="No">Most importantly, surgical leaders must imagine and empower a future in which treatment of the next generation of patients is better than contemporary care.</Para>
            </Section2>
            <Section2 ID="Sec4">
              <Heading>The Research Mission</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par15" TextBreak="No">In academic medical centers, innovation is the chief source of differentiation and competitive advantage, and surgeons must actively engage in scientific discovery to remain relevant. In contemporary basic investigation, however, there is no surgical research, just research. Basic investigation is reductionist and mechanistically oriented. Western blotting and polymerase chain reaction and transgenic animal models apply equally to investigators from Surgery, Immunology or Biochemistry. In addition, methodological advances in genetics, metabolomics and biocomputation, among many others, make it impossible for any single investigator to master all techniques. Basic science is now and forever a team sport. As such, success in basic science requires equal measures of analytic talent and personality. As clinical medicine has become multidisciplinary, so too has biology.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par16" TextBreak="No">The performance of an operation constitutes a clear transition in care, and a cause and effect relationship between intervention and outcomes like complication or death is less equivocal than for non-surgical treatment. The link between operation and outcome has been the intellectual lynchpin of surgical health services research. To date, the clarity of this relationship has allowed health services research to remain âsurgicalâ. This situation will not persist. The creation of âbig dataâ and the influence of ideas from economics and social research will change and enrich this field as well. Soon there will be no surgical health services research, just health services research.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par17" TextBreak="No">Surgical leaders are talent scouts. Most physicians are ultimately drawn to the intellectual foundations of the disciplines they choose, but many are initially attracted to the field by the example of a more senior mentor. Talented young people are stimulated by environments that are open, accepting of differences, rewarding. A small research project becomes a presentation at a symposium, which begets a larger project, which blossoms into an investigative career.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par18" TextBreak="No">An inevitable tension exists between the clear demands and tangible rewards of clinical surgery and the uncertainty of research. A long line of past patients and a seemingly unlimited number of future patients confront the surgeon. The emergency department demands attention every day. The emotional rewards of a well-executed operation are immediate. Financial results are obvious. In contrast, novel ideas are fleeting and rare. Surgical leaders can shape the research mission through personal research accomplishments and scholarship. They also support investigation by displaying intellectual engagement, perseverance and curiosity. As with clinical care, surgical leaders must imagine and fund future investigation.</Para>
            </Section2>
            <Section2 ID="Sec5">
              <Heading>The Teaching Mission</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par19" TextBreak="No">Surgeons involved in undergraduate medical education and in postgraduate training are uniquely privileged. Beyond the patients they treat directly, these individuals influence the lives of thousands of others, cared for in turn by their trainees. Cognitive development in surgical training is not different from that associated with other medical disciplines. The principles of adult learning apply equally to both groups of learners. In contrast, the technical aspects of surgical training have no parallels in non-surgical disciplines. The teaching of surgery requires special traits of the instructor â patience, the ability to instill confidence in another person, communication through both verbal and non-verbal cues, and the self-possession required to help another succeed.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par20" TextBreak="No">Training to be a surgeon can be emotionally trying, and not for the obvious reasons that the hours can be long and physically fatiguing or that surgical emergencies are stressful. Surgery is difficult because committing to an operation imparts responsibility to the surgeon for another personâs life. Not all patients can be cured; palliation may be elusive; complications occur. Failure is intrinsic to the practice of surgery. The best teachers of surgery are empathic to their trainees and are able to guide emotional maturation. These traits are surely the substrate of leadership.</Para>
            </Section2>
          </Section1>
          <Section1 ID="Sec6">
            <Heading>Initial Faculty Experiences</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par21" TextBreak="No">During junior faculty years, those immediately following the completion of residency or fellowship training, formal administrative responsibilities should be avoided. Every surgeon upon entering independent practice must develop personal clinical judgment, determine how he will comport himself in an operating room, and must establish ties to referring physicians. Complications occur in every practice and the young surgeon must learn to face them forthrightly and with equanimity. In teaching hospitals, the young faculty member must switch from receiving instruction to providing guidance. The first years are especially important in research; lack of focus and productivity at this juncture can permanently short circuit an investigative career. In the most positive sense, these years should be a self-directed investment in future productivity. While many of these activities are the building blocks of leadership, and while every year provides opportunities for leadership, personal development requires time and focus.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par22" TextBreak="No">Surgical practice is intrinsically risky. Surgical procedures all have known complication rates, and many have an expected mortality. In addition to physical impairment, surgical complications are financially costly. It has been estimated that each surgical complication adds $11,000 to the cost of surgical care. In addition, surgery is the most public form of medical practice. As an obvious example, surgical procedures are performed in an operating room with a scrub nurse and a circulating nurse, anesthesiology care giver and often one or more trainees. At another level, the direct relationship of surgical complications to the performance of an operation makes public examination of imperfect results routine. A weekly morbidity and mortality conference is a staple of every surgical training program in this country. The risk inherent to surgery, its public nature and the resultant scrutiny thrusts surgical leaders into positions of judgment. Credibility in this regard is contingent upon the leaderâs clinical abilities. Strong cultural norms in American Surgery make it very difficult for surgeons that are not clinically experienced and active to assume meaningful leadership roles.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par23" TextBreak="No">Research is the key to improving current surgical practice. Investigation is also uncertain and expensive. Surgical research is not relevant to non-academic medical centers, and has become optional and endangered at many others. Where research is important, early investigative success is an essential criterion for surgical leadership.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par24" TextBreak="No">Clinical teaching is less embattled than research and is a foundation of most departments of surgery. A commitment to teaching and a record of teaching ability should be considered a prerequisite to leadership development.</Para>
          </Section1>
          <Section1 ID="Sec7">
            <Heading>Temperament and Values</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par25" TextBreak="No">While experience is influential in leadership development, in many ways temperament is more important. To succeed in these dimensions, surgical leaders must possess integrity, selflessness, the ability to communicate and curiosity.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par26" TextBreak="No">Personal integrity is the single most important quality of leadership. While integrity alone does not guarantee leadership success, the perceived absence of this quality does guarantee failure. At the simplest level, integrity means that the effective leader does what he has said he will do. For example, if the surgical leader has committed to provide resources to a newly recruited faculty member, integrity means that those resources have been accrued and will be available. If a salary has been negotiated, the money will be paid. Operating room time promised will be delivered. Promises that are made for material or financial benefits will be met. However, integrity in this sense is purely transactional. Transactional interactions do not engage group imagination or collective action, and leadership that rests solely on the authority to provide material benefit or financial transfers is fragile [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par27" TextBreak="No">At the next level, integrity means the group perceives that the leader does what she thinks is right. This state implies that the organization understands that the leader has a moral framework that informs decisions, is consistently true to those convictions, and that she resists powerful forces within the organization if she thinks they are wrong or threaten group welfare. Consider the promises alluded to above. In any surgical department, there is never enough lab space, money or operating room time to satisfy the needs and aspirations of all. Necessarily, commitment of resources to one faculty recruit, salary increase to another or operating room time to a third, affects the whole organization. In addition, there are no guarantees at the time of commitment that those resources will be used productively or to the benefit of the whole organization. Decisions of the leader that are seen to arise from a moral center of gravity allow the group to accept the risks that commitment of resources always entails.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par28" TextBreak="No">Integrity also has a time element. Personal integrity displayed over time creates trust. Trust is hard-earned, resilient, and very powerful in that this condition allows the group to engage with the leaderâs longer term vision. With trust, a belief develops that the leader will be consistent through success and failure, through thick and thin, that the leader encountered today will express the same values in the future. Let the reader imagine a personal example. Think of a person in your life that you trust. Imagine that you have not seen him or her in a month, a year, perhaps a decade. Trust means you believe that when you meet this person next he or she will display a consistent set of values and will treat you fairly, as you have been treated in the past.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par29" TextBreak="No">Effective leaders work to achieve a vision for the future that maximizes the potential of others and benefits the organization, for example a department of surgery. To do so, the leader must be outward-looking and not concerned with personal advantage or benefit. There must be joy and satisfaction for the leader in the success and recognition of others. This quality of selflessness is a core ethical value in medicine in which the welfare and benefit of the patient takes precedence over the self-interest of the treating physician. This viewpoint is diametrically opposed to modern American business practices in which maximizing profit is the standard and in which placing personal interest first is an accepted ethical starting point. Selflessness cannot be taught. For surgical leaders, this quality requires a bedrock sense of personal wholeness and confidence.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par30" TextBreak="No">Communication is absolutely essential to leadership. Effective leadership requires a commitment to continuous expression of core values, institutional objectives and future aspirations.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par31" TextBreak="No">The most powerful communication resides in the manner in which a leader lives his or her life. For better and worse, leaders are observed and their actions (and inactions) are scrutinized. Respectful language, humility, and humane treatment of othersâ failings resonate strongly and positively. Positive communication of this sort allows the leader to accumulate credit in a bank of goodwill. This credit can be depleted incredibly rapidly, sometimes instantly, by crude humor, hubris, or cruelty. Perceived hypocrisy in a leader is especially corrosive. A leader cannot profess value in teaching and at the same time ignore medical students, and cannot ask others to be productive in research while not being academically engaged. The surgical leaderâs professional life is on brightest display in the operating room. The surgeon leader does not need to be the slickest operator in the department, but he or she absolutely must be the most respectful to the nurses, the calmest when problems arise, the person with whom the anesthesiologists feel most comfortable. True surgical leadership cannot be gained solely in the operating room, but it can surely be lost.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par32" TextBreak="No">In our verbal society, spoken communication is key, and effective leaders develop multiple styles of verbal expression. It seems obvious that talking privately with a junior house officer struggling with a major postoperative complication would differ in approach than annual salary negotiations with senior faculty. Public presentations to scientifically sophisticated professional audiences require different language skills than do talks to lay groups.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par33" TextBreak="No">Effective communication uses a variety of verbal tools, and leaders must work to master all. Consider the power of analogy. This author might describe his work at a research seminar by saying âMy laboratory studies hypothalamic control of ingestive behavior and metabolic rate. We have deep expertise in the melanocortin signaling system and have developed a number of transgenic animal models to examine signal transduction in this system.â This description probably would not work with a successful business person considering laboratory endowment. Perhaps it might be better to say âI study eating. The brain has an area that acts like a thermostat. Turn the thermostat up and we feel hungry; turn it down and we stop eating. Iâm trying to see if we can control that thermostat so we can cure overweight.â</Para>
            <Para ID="Par34" TextBreak="No">While verbal expression is important, listening is crucial. Effective listening is not passive, and active listening is a skill that must be developed. Listening effectively involves asking questions as the other speaks to elicit deeper meaning, to clarify ambiguity and to draw forth new ideas. Active listening involves verbal encouragement and visual cues, and sometimes just sitting silently while the speaker organizes his or her thoughts. The best leaders practice a 2:1 rule; the leader listens 2 min for every minute that he or she talks. Listening is not easy; it requires practice.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par35" TextBreak="No">Because we live in such a verbal/visual society, there is special power for leaders that can express themselves in writing with style and clarity. Writing is hard work. Ann Patchett, the highly successful novelist, has recently written âLogic dictates that writing should be a natural act, a function of a well-operating human body, along the lines of speaking and walking and breathing. We should be able to tap into the constant narrative flow our minds provide, the roaring river of words filling up our heads, and direct it out into a neat stream of organized thought so that other people can read itâ¦â¦.But itâs right about there, right about when we sit down to write that story, that things fall apartâ [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. Aspiring leaders should not despair. Like many difficult and important skills, writing becomes easier with daily practice.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par36" TextBreak="No">The technical complexity of surgical practice has accelerated at an unprecedented pace in the past decade, and non-operative therapy must be integrated with surgical care. Every branch of surgery has examples. Abdominal aortic aneurysms may be treated via laparotomy or endovascularly, depending upon anatomic variability and patient characteristics. The proper treatment of breast cancer requires knowledge of the cell biology of nuclear receptors and angiogenesis in additional to sentinel lymph node biopsy. Care for patients with choledocholithiasis combines endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, each applied expertly. As a consequence of these advances, clinical surgery has become increasingly specialized and narrowly focused. Similar forces affect surgical research. Basic investigation advances apace, and so does health services research, but they use fundamentally different techniques. Surgical leaders are called to promote and coordinate diverse surgical specialties and to simultaneously advance surgical knowledge. The ability to do so rests upon openness to novelty and change and a habit of mind that restlessly seeks the stimulation of new ideas. Pasteur noted âChance only favours the prepared mind.â Just so. Leadership belongs to the curious.</Para>

            <Heading>A Call to Leadership</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par37" TextBreak="No">For most, the call to leadership does not arrive with a clarion note, a neon sign that flashes LEAD, LEAD, LEAD or some similar epiphany. Rather, the young faculty member establishes a reputation for clinical excellence, or a robust research program, or becomes a valued teacher, and someone asks for help or collaboration or guidance. Someone asks for leadership. And a little voice whispers, âYou can do this. You can reach beyond yourself. Maybe you can be a leader.â When this happens, there is only one sensible thing to do. Stop right away. Ask this question: Do you really want to help and develop others at the expense of yourself? Be sure the answer is yes.</Para>

            <Heading>Leadership Phenotype</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par38" TextBreak="No">A leadership stereotype has come to dominate American business and political culture. Leaders are characterized as extroverted, assertive, dominating, and often self-aggrandizing. Twentieth century American history provides many examples â General Douglas MacArthur, President Clinton, General Electric chairman Jack Welch to name a few. In her book, Quiet, author Susan Cain contends that these traits may not actually characterize effective leadership. She writes âContrary to the Harvard Business School model of vocal leadership, the ranks of effective CEOs turns out to be filled with introverts, including Charles Schwab; Bill Gates; Brenda Barnes, CEO of Sara Lee; and James Copeland, former CEO of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. âAmong the most effective leaders I have encountered and worked with in half a century,â the management guru Peter Drucker has written, âsome locked themselves in their office and others were ultra-gregarious. Some were quick and impulsive, while others studied the situation and took forever to come to a decision. The one and only personality trait the effective ones I encountered did have in common was something they did <Emphasis Type="Italic">not</Emphasis> have: They had little or no âcharismaâ and little use either for the term or what it signifiesââ [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par39" TextBreak="No">Leadership is different from authority. The rapid change and uncertainty that characterizes modern surgical practice requires creative risk taking; effective leaders create an environment in which talented people feel safe to take risks. This confidence comes from knowing that the price of failure is not too great, and from being part of a group of like-minded people. Uncertainty requires creativity to resolve unknowns. Leaders must use influence beyond a position of authority because authority alone does not stimulate creativity.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par40" TextBreak="No">Many have heard the bromide that âShe is a born leaderâ and have uncritically accepted this truism. Consider an alternative statement that âShe is a born surgeon.â Almost all surgeons would reject such a notion out of hand. Surgical mastery requires a lifetime of focused work. Surgical training consumes 5â10 years after medical school. Refined physical skills require thousands of hours of intentional practice to obtain and hone; mature judgment is hard earned. According to one study, surgical results improve progressively as surgeons age, peaking in the decade between 50 and 60 years [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. Surgical mastery surely requires intrinsic talent â physical dexterity, ability to think in three dimensions and concentration â but surgical skill is acquired not intrinsic. That is why it is called the practice of surgery. So too, leadership skills. Potential leaders need to possess relevant talents, including confidence, altruism and analytical ability. Leadership skills are built on this foundation.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par41" TextBreak="No">Aspiring leaders require additional preparation beyond those experiences described above to function optimally in our complex health care system.

            <Para ID="Par50" TextBreak="No">In 2012, the Department of Surgery at the University of Michigan inaugurated the Leadership Development Program in Surgery. The program, which extended over a year, was explicitly designed to include each of the content domains listed, and was directed at Michiganâs emerging surgical leaders. The initial class included 24 mid-level faculty members in the Department of Surgery, approximately 20Â % of total surgical faculty. The Leadership Development Program was led by Dr. Justin Dimick, Associate Chair for Faculty Affairs in the Department of Surgery and by Dr. Christy Lemak, Director of the Griffith Leadership Center and The National Center for Healthcare Leadership within the Michigan School of Public Health. Professor Lemakâs teaching focuses on management, leadership and strategies of health care organizations. Her research focuses on how payers and providers interact to achieve better cost and quality performance, collaborative models for improving surgical outcomes, and leadership development of clinicians and other health professionals. The Griffith Leadership Center is ranked #1 in the United States among schools of public health. Dr. Dimick serves on the leadership team for the Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation at the University of Michigan where he has an active research program focused on quality measurement, policy evaluation, and large-scale quality improvement interventions. The faculty for the Leadership Development Program was drawn from the Medical School, School of Public Health and the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. Being able to draw faculty from three top-10 schools on the same central campus was deemed essential for the success of the program.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par51" TextBreak="No">For leadership programs to be successful the participants must be selected carefully. Leadership development programs intended for medical professionals benefit by having a broad representation of specialties; such diversity is helpful by providing a range of experiences and perspectives. For surgically oriented programs, the participants should each have demonstrated personal achievement in clinical care, research and instruction and should have made an overt decision to seek broader engagement. Asking potential participants to write an essay outlining their aspirations is a useful way to gauge future goals. Essays were used to select participants in the Michigan Leadership Development Program.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par52" TextBreak="No">Successful leadership development programs boost group morale and create strong teams, but team building takes time. For this to happen, potential participants must fully commit to the time needed and schedules must be rearranged to assure unbroken attendance. The instructional sessions for the Leadership Development Program consisted of a series of all-day Friday blocks. The meetings were held on-campus but remote from the hospital. Prospective participants were required to commit to all sessions and to forego any other activities â clinical work, professional travel, vacation, etc. â for all sessions. Inability to make this commitment precluded participation. Administrative leaders were then contacted to rearrange schedules so that this obligation would be met. Assurances were provided that no financial penalty would apply to any leadership program participant because of absence from other scheduled activities.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par53" TextBreak="No">Leadership programs must begin with well-articulated visions and goals. The goals of the Michigan Leadership Development Program were to provide emerging leaders with the knowledge, perspectives and tools required to succeed in the contemporary medical environment. These goals were to be met through exposure to thought leaders and content experts in relevant topical fields, through team-building exercises and via self-initiated team-based projects.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par54" TextBreak="No">Leadership programs are generally benefitted by having practicing leaders provide instruction. For example, health care finance is a topic of every program. Learning how to calculate a return on investment (ROI) or the meaning of net present value (NPV) are crucial exercises. These topics were covered by professors from the Ross School of Business and the School of Public Health. However, examining a balance sheet detached from real-world context, while crucial, is admitted also a dry exercise for most clinicians. These topics came to life when the University Hospital CEO followed the didactic session by explaining the long-term sources and uses of hospital capital, and especially when the Department of Surgery chair used the departmentâs balance sheet as a teaching aid.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par55" TextBreak="No">Many leadership programs entail the performance of projects that seek to build coherent teams and to solve currently pressing problems. These efforts are helpful to illustrate the use of the topics covered in the curriculum, for example, financial analysis or operational optimization. In the Leadership Development Program, the participants were divided into a series of teams, most with 4 members. Self-selected projects were proposed and then vetted by the entire group. Deliverable outcomes were required. After group approval, funding and personnel resources were provided. Projects ranged from referring physician outreach to creation of new clinical programs to development of unique electronic media for postgraduate teaching.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par56" TextBreak="No">To have lasting effect, leadership development programs should seek to move beyond discrete initiatives. The best projects do not end. The most successful project leads to another area for improvement and thence another project. In fact, the best projects are not actually about results; the best are simply vehicles that create a culture of innovation and inquiry. Engagement always trumps outcomes because, while projects are transient, cultural transformation is persistent. An example of this process which was derived from the Leadership Development Program is called Team Action Projects in Surgery â TAPS. Headed by Dr. Sandra Wong, newly appointed Associate Chair for Clinical Affairs, TAPS is structured as shown in Figs.Â <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">2.1</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2.2</InternalRef>. The teams are led from the middle by third-year surgical residents. Faculty members are involved to lend guidance and perspective and to provide material resources. The teams always include students, including undergraduates of the University of Michigan, first and second year medical students and graduate students from non-medical disciplines. For surgical house staff, this structure provides experience in team building and engagement in areas not traditionally part of surgical training. Essential leadership skills in areas of communication and innovation are required. Students provide energy, fresh perspectives and non-medical skills. In addition, for some students, participation has sparked interest in a medical career. Surgical faculty benefit by the inclusion of talented and motivated young people dedicated to solution of practical problems. For example, the first project examined high variability in performance times of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, one of the most common procedures in General Surgery. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

            <Para ID="Par57" TextBreak="No">Formal preparation should be followed by leadership auditions. Every participant in the Leadership Development Program was provided opportunity for a larger leadership role within the Department of Surgery. In any department of surgery there are many opportunities: clerkship director, associate chair for research, division head, residency program director. The auditions were structured to give graded responsibilities and the possibility of larger leadership roles. These tests of leadership are designed to answer two fundamental questions. From the perspectives of the other members of the department: Is the developing leader good at leading? From the perspective of the new leader: Do I like being out front? And, is this something I want to be a permanent part of my life?</Para>
            <Para ID="Par58" TextBreak="No">Leadership development is stimulated by feedback. A powerful tool for intermittent feedback is the 360Â° evaluation method. In this process, differing perspectives of the leader â from supervisors, peers, direct reports, nurses, and house staff â provide appraisal of strengths, weaknesses and areas for improvement. The responses are rendered anonymous to encourage candor. Usually, both a structured evaluation instrument and written comments are provided. All leaders need periodic feedback on their performances as leaders. The structure of the 360 method with its holistic view and anonymous evaluations helps leaders see themselves as others see them. Leadership improves with practice. What changes is the leaderâs capacity to use interpersonal relationships to move and shape people and events. All participants in the Leadership Development Program were required to participate in a 360Â° evaluation. A series of professional coaching sessions then followed to first interpret the results and then to suggest methods for leadership improvement.</Para>

            <Heading>The Leadership Dilemma</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par59" TextBreak="No">As Chatman and Kennedy note, âThe obvious traits such as confidence, dominance, assertiveness or intelligence, have not, it turns out, shown the level of predictive validity that one would hope for. Rather, we suggest three subtle but likely more powerful qualities that transcend particular individual differences and behaviors. They are a leaderâs diagnostic capabilities, the breadth and flexibility of his behavioral repertoire, and his understanding of the leadership paradoxâ [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. Here diagnostic acumen is meant as the ability to determine for every situation the unique contribution that the leader could make to crafting a solution to that particular circumstance. The obvious value is that every challenge is considered on its own merits and that proposed solutions are tailored. It also follows that leaders need a broad and flexible array of behaviors to respond to an equally wide array of complex situations.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par60" TextBreak="No">The effective leader is very self-aware, has a clear moral center, is fair and balanced, and is interpersonally skilled, but ultimately, is also dispensable. Effective leaders are dispensable because they create a culture of shared decision making and attract other leaders. The most powerful strategy, the hardest to create but the most durable, is creating a culture in which leaders strive to develop other leaders and provide experience which is useful for that purpose. As Chapman and Kennedy observe, âThe ultimate test of leadership is how well the team does when the leader is not presentâ [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. This is the leadership paradox.</Para>

Their strong surgical leadership will assure that the discipline of Surgery remains at the forefront of contemporary medical practice. Surgical leadership that is imaginative, engaged with other specialties, and open to new ideas will draw the best lessons from the past to build a positive future. This form of leadership, at its best, will motivate departure from the routine, stimulate new learning and inspire new action. Change is everywhere.
