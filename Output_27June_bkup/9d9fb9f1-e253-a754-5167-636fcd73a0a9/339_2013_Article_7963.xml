              <Para>Double-layer graphene sheets (DLGSs) have potential applications as nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) resonators due to their specific carrier spectrum of electrons. In this study, analysis of the vibration modes of NEMS resonators using simply supported circular DLGSs has been undertaken based on nonlocal thin plate theory. Considering the properties of DLGSs, the vibration mode of circular DLGSs can be divided into an in-phase mode (IPM) and an anti-phase mode (APM). The range of resonance frequencies in the IPM is much larger than in the APM because of the influence of van der Waals forces. Nonlocal effects significantly influence the resonance frequency of circular DLGSs in higher vibration modes and at lower aspect ratios.</Para>

              <Para>Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) are emerging as strong candidates for a host of important applications in semiconductor-based technology and fundamental science [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. They have been fabricated from graphene sheets (GSs) by mechanically exfoliating thin sheets from graphite over trenches in silicon oxide [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. GSs are single layers of carbon arranged in a honeycomb lattice and are one of the thinnest materials ever made [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. They have outstanding mechanical [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>], thermal [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>] and field-emission properties [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. Moreover, due to their conductance changing as a function of the extent of surface adsorption, their large specific surface area and low Johnson noise make them a promising candidate for nanosensors or NEMS resonators [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. Dan et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>] studied the intrinsic response of graphene vapor sensors and suggested that the contamination layer chemically dopes graphene, enhancing carrier scattering and the sensor response by acting as an absorbent layer that concentrates analyte molecules at the graphene surface. Recently, Sorkin and Zhang [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>] constructed a simple atomistic model for circular GS nanosensors that provides useful information for the potential application of GSs in NEMS. Lee et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>] assumed a nanomechanical resonator sensor using simply supported rectangular single-layer GSs (SLGSs) and analyzed its vibration properties based on nonlocal elasticity theory.</Para>
              <Para>Double-layer GSs (DLGSs) consist of two layers of GSs connected by van der Waals (vdW) forces, and they are very different from SLGSs. The carrier spectrum of electrons in ideal DLGSs is gapless and approximately parabolic at low energies around two points in the Brillouin zone. The quantum dots created through position-dependent doping break the equivalence between the upper and lower layers [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. Virojanadara et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>] investigated epitaxial growth of graphene on silicon carbide and proposed a new process for preparing large, homogeneous and stable DLGSs on the (0001) SiC surface. Thus, the fundamental properties, such as the vibrational properties of DLGSs, are important for the application of DLGSs as NEMS resonators. From vibrational analysis of DLGSs, the upper and lower layers are found to deflect in either the same or opposite directions, which are defined as the in-phase mode (IPM) and the anti-phase mode (APM) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>Various models have been proposed to study the vibration modes of GSs [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>]. Based on the stiffness properties of the reactive empirical bond order potential, Shakouri et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>] developed a new atomistic structural model, from which the resonance frequencies of flexural vibration for rectangular SLGSs of different sizes, chiralities and boundary conditions can be calculated. Mianroodi et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>] investigated the nonlinear, large-amplitude vibrational properties of SLGSs based on a membrane model, and solved the nonlinear equation by a finite-difference method. Elastic plate theory has been used to study mechanical behavior of GSs by scholars. Wang et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>] developed a nonlinear continuum model for the vibrational analysis of multi-layer GSs, in which there are nonlinear vdW interactions between the two adjacent layers. Based on continuum thin plate theory, an agreement with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been achieved in predicting the mechanical behavior of SLGSs under a central point load [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>]. Nonlocal elasticity theory, which assumes that the stress at a reference point is a function of the strain at every point in the body [<CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>], is superior to the classic continuum model and is widely used in the mechanical analysis of GSs [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>]. Arash and Wang [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>] investigated free vibration of SLGSs and DLGSs by employing nonlocal continuum theory and MD simulations. The nonlocal plate model can achieve satisfactory vibrational solutions with the calibrated nonlocal parameter, and the results based on the nonlocal model are in good agreement with those obtained by MD simulations. The nonlocal plate model is found to be indispensable in vibration analysis of GSs with a length less than 8 nm on their sides. However, the vibrational analysis of circular GSs has received little attention, especially in circular DLGSs.</Para>
              <Para>In our previous work, vibration analysis of circular DLGSs was carried out using circular plate theory without considering nonlocal effects [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. In this study, the vibrational properties of NEMS resonators using simply supported circular DLGSs in IPM and APM have been analyzed based on nonlocal elasticity theory. The upper and lower layers of the circular DLGSs are modeled as two thin circular plates that are held together by vdW forces. The resonance frequencies of the circular DLGSs in IPM and APM are simulated by a theoretical approach. Especially, the nonlocal effect on the resonance frequencies is discussed in detail.</Para>

              <Para>Because the membrane model cannot sustain the compression stress and the bending moments [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>], the thin-plate model is used for modeling GSs in this work.

              <Para>According to Eringen [<CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>], in nonlocal elasticity theory, the stress at a reference point in an elastic continuum depends not only on the strain at the point but also on the strains at every point of the body. This is attributed by Eringen to the atomic theory of lattice dynamics and the experimental observations on phonon dispersion. Then, the nonlocal constitutive behavior of a Hookean solid can be defined by the following differential constitutive relationship:

              <Para>Calculation of the vibration characteristics was carried out for a circular DLGS with a simply supported edge. In the simulations, circular DLGSs were modeled as two layers of circular GSs coupled together via vdW interactions. The effective thickness (<Emphasis Type="Italic">h</Emphasis>) of each layer of the circular DLGS is equal to the diameter of a carbon atom (0.34 nm). The Young’s modulus <Emphasis Type="Italic">E</Emphasis> and the mass density <Emphasis Type="Italic">ρ</Emphasis> of circular DLGSs are 1 TPa and 2300 kg/m<Superscript>3</Superscript>, respectively [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>]. The vdW interaction coefficient between two adjacent GSs is −108 GPa/nm from Eq. (<InternalRef RefID="Equ21">11</InternalRef>). <Emphasis Type="Italic">D</Emphasis> is the diameter of the circular DLGSs.</Para>
              <Para>The IPM and APM can be derived from Eq. (<InternalRef RefID="Equ36">20</InternalRef>) for circular DLGSs with simply supported boundary conditions. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef> shows typical vibration mode shapes of IPM and APM for circular DLGSs obtained using different combinations of low wave numbers (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>,<Emphasis Type="Italic">m</Emphasis>), where <Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>=0 or 1 and <Emphasis Type="Italic">m</Emphasis>=1 or 2.

                <Subscript>2</Subscript>) was found to be 1 for IPM. This means that the two layers of the circular DLGSs have the same vibration amplitudes and always vibrate in the same direction. The vibration amplitude ratio for APM is −1, which means that both sheets are moving with the same amplitude, but in opposite directions. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig2">

                <Emphasis Type="Italic">a</Emphasis>=0, 1 and 2 nm) are almost the same for the first radial mode of IPM and APM in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>a and b. As the radial mode number increases, the resonance frequencies diverge. The resonance frequencies of circular DLGSs decrease with increasing nonlocal parameter (<Emphasis Type="Italic">e</Emphasis>
                <Subscript>0</Subscript>
                <Emphasis Type="Italic">a</Emphasis>). When the radial mode numbers of the IPM and APM increase, the resonance frequencies of circular DLGSs become more sensitive to the nonlocal parameters. However, the range of variation for IPM is much larger than for APM with the same nonlocal parameter. For example, the resonance frequencies of circular DLGSs in APM with <Emphasis Type="Italic">e</Emphasis>

                <Emphasis Type="Italic">a</Emphasis>=2 nm only increase a little with increasing radial mode number; the resonance frequencies for IPM (0,5) are 2.3, 4.2 and 10.2 THz when <Emphasis Type="Italic">e</Emphasis>

              <Para>The nonlocal vibrational properties of circular DLGSs have been investigated using thin-plate theory and an approach has been proposed for analyzing the resonance frequency of circular DLGSs with simply supported boundary conditions. The vibration mode of circular DLGSs can be divided into IPM and APM, which is a unique feature of DLGSs, and the two modes were analyzed in detail. The results showed that the resonance frequencies in APM are less sensitive to the vibration modes than in IPM because of the vdW forces. The nonlocal effect on the resonance frequency of circular DLGSs was also discussed. The nonlocal effect becomes more significant with higher vibration modes and smaller aspect ratios of circular DLGSs. By choosing the exact values of the nonlocal parameters, the proposed method may provide a guide for the application of circular DLGSs as nanomechanical systems resonators.</Para>
