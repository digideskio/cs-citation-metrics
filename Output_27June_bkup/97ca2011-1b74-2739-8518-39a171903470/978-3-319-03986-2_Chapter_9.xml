          <Para TextBreak="No">The concept and notions of “medicalisation” is one of the major contributions of medical sociology to medical practice and the understanding of human health. It is a concept that depicts a cautionary note in the expansion of the medical domain. The notion of medicalisation is closely linked with the social construction of realities. Issues that are termed as medical are constructed by participants in medical practice in order to expand the scope of medicine; the tendency is referred to as medicalisation, a process that explains how ordinary issues (usually non-medical) are defined as medical problems, thus requiring medical attention in terms of diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

The other subsections in the chapter examine some major aspects of medicalisation, including pharmaceuticalisation, geneticisation, remedicalisation and demedicalisation, and medical enhancement. Later, specific examples of medicalisation are provided, including medicalisation at the beginning, during, and end of life—pregnancy/childbirth, beauty, and death respectively. The chapter ends with a discussion of the four models of client-practitioner relations including the paternalistic model, informative model, interpretive model, and deliberative model. It is noted that client-practitioner relations significantly affect the utilisation of health facilities, quality and outcomes of care, clients’ satisfaction, and inform a number of ethical challenges.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">The concept of medicalisation is another major contributions of medical sociology to medical practice and the understanding of human health. It depicts a cautionary note in the expansion of the medical domain. The notion of medicalisation is closely linked with the social construction of realities. Participants in medical practice construct issues that are termed as medical in order to expand the scope of medicine. Medicalisation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Medicalisation</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> describes how ordinary issues (usually non-medical) are defined as medical problems, thus requiring medical attention in terms of diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. In other words, medicalisation involves defining a problem in medical terms, usually as an illness or disorder, or using a medical intervention to treat it (Conrad <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2005</CitationRef>, p. 3, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2007</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2013</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Conrad, P.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. There is a growing tendency to define all social abnormalities or deviance as medical problems. The view stems from the notion that those who are healthy in a medical sense should not behave abnormally. In the same vein, Bell and Figert (<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2012</CitationRef>, p. 776)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Bell, S.E.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>
            <IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Figert, A.E.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> observed that wider social processes such as rationalisation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Rationalisation</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, systematisation of the medical domain, and rational application of science to everyday life foster the process of medicalisation. This implies that medicalising a situation gradually becomes a way to explain it, a form of medical explanatory model. Medicalisation also provides a way to eliminate mystical explanations of social events and gives room for the application of biomedical science to objectively explain such social events.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Medicalisation postulates that medicine has increased its relevance and domains in the management of human society. This reflects in all stages of human existence: pre-conception, conception, childhood<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm>, adulthood<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Adulthood</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, old age, death, and posthumous condition. Invariably, medicalisation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Medicalisation</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> means increasing human dependence on medicine throughout the course of life, generated through professional expansions. At any point, anyone may be referred to the medical institution for certification. More importantly, the medical expansion of the domain of relevance involves the conversion of a social or moral problem to a disease (Filc <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">2004</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Filc, D.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Medicalisation is perpetuated through medical hegemony<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Medical hegemony</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> on social formation, especially in practitioner-patient relationships. It is further observed that physicians play a hegemonic role in the health care system. Filc (<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">2004</CitationRef>, p. 1277)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Filc, D.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> specifically noted that apart from the professional expansion, medicalisation is also perpetuated through the “desocialisation of illness and disease so as to obscure the social processes working in their production.” Desocialisation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Secondary>definition</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm>in this regard refers to the conversion of normal behaviour to abnormality (or deviance) or the labelling of more social traits as (medical) pathologies (see Sect. <ExternalRef>

            </IndexTerm>. Desocialisation thus generates more interests for medical practitioners by underplaying the social context. Sociologists are interested in medicalisation because of its emerging consequences. These consequences are also part of the process through which medicalisation itself occurs. The consequences include, among others:</Para>

                <Primary>Medicalisation</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>, by describing more categories of social deviance as mental problems (Szasz <CitationRef CitationID="CR41">1970</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Szasz, T.</Primary>

                <Primary>Pathologisation</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> of deviance is a critical way of ensuring social control, as more individuals try to “escape” medicalised situations to avoid being subjected to psychiatric testing and diagnosis. For instance, if a traffic offence (like speeding) is linked to a mental disorder, more individuals may try to avoid being subjected to psychiatric tests by avoiding such an offence. The discussion of medicalisation also relates to labelling<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Foucault coined the concept in his book <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Birth of the Clinic</Emphasis> (first published in 1973) to describe the objectification of the body in clinical practice and how the human body is constantly under medical scrutiny. He described medical gaze as a dehumanising medical separation of the body from the person. The body thus becomes a medical domain with various ramifications.

                <Primary>Pharmaceuticalisation</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> is the incorporation of more human conditions into the domain of pharmaceutical intervention (i.e., requiring medication). Prescription drug sales are growing worldwide. One of the reasons for pharmaceutical expansionism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Pharmaceutical expansionism</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> is business motive. Like other market products are expanding, so are pharmaceuticals in human care for enhancement, prevention, and treatment. The critical aspect of coverage is in the area of non-disease condition, or as a preventive measure. Vaccination is everybody’s business because of probable exposure. There is growing pressure to improve human immunity in order to ward off predictable medical conditions. New drugs are being tested with attendant opportunities, but also ethical risks. More specifically, pharmaceuticalisation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Pharmaceuticalisation</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> has been variously defined as “the transformation of human conditions, capacities or capabilities into pharmaceutical matters of treatment or enhancement” (Williams et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR48">2011</CitationRef>, p. 711)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Williams, S.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Enhancement involves non-disease treatment, especially to improve specific performances (see Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec5">9.1.5</InternalRef>). On the other hand, pharmaceuticalisation is also “the process by which social, behavioural or bodily conditions are treated or deemed to be in need of treatment, with medical drugs by doctors or patients” (Abraham <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2009</CitationRef>, p. 100)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Abraham, J.</Primary>

              </IndexTerm> is common. With weak pharmaceutical regulations in developing countries, drugs can be purchased from street hawkers and in public places like bus stops.

The roles of these actors often promote the expansionist idea that there are pharmaceutical solutions to most life and health problems. The major danger of pharmaceuticalisation, however, is that therapeutic interest is gradually undermined for nontherapeutic issues (see Sects. <InternalRef RefID="Sec6">9.1.5</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Sec9">9.1.6.2</InternalRef>).

The main thrust of sociological investigation is to apply sociological perspectives to unravel the social trends, dynamics, and implications of genetic testing and research. For instance, Lippman (<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">1991</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Lippman, A.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> observed that the use of genetic testing is clearly more of a social use of genetic technology than a medical use.</Para>

Hence “geneticisation” is defined as the “socio-cultural process of interpreting and explaining human beings using the terminology and concepts of genetics, so that not only health and disease but also aspects of human behaviour and social interactions are viewed through the prism of biomolecular technology” (Ten Have <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">2012</CitationRef>, p. 1)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>. The gene is said to promote involvement in uncommitted sex (one-night stands). The question is: does this genetic discovery of an <Emphasis Type="Italic">adultery gene</Emphasis> mean that sociocultural and legal environments do not influence the prevalence of sexual infidelity in a community? The geneticisation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Geneticisation</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> of marital infidelity<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Marital infidelity</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> then holds a lot of sociocultural implications. Since most human beings value marital fidelity, is genetic testing<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Genetic testing</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> required before marriage to determine whether a partner has the gene variant or not? What happens to groups in which the adultery gene<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Adultery gene</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> is more common? One other implicit lesson from the scientific finding would be a desocialisation of sexual promiscuity: that racial/ethnic ancestry, age, and gender do not relate to sexual infidelity. This is a drive towards genetic determinism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Genetic determinism</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>, which undermines the evidence that genetic traits and the environment (social as well as physical) account for human behaviour. Genes alone do not determine how people behave or succumb to a certain disease, but affect the risk.</Para>

Demedicalisation (an obverse of medicalisation) is a process of normalisation after a previous application of medical terms. Conrad (<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">1992</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2007</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Recently, they have been regarded as normal behaviours and there is a clamour for all societies to recognise homosexuality and bisexuality as normal sexual orientations. Many nations (including South Africa) now legalise homosexuality, while many nations in Africa still criminalise it. The rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> are also part of human rights recognised in many nations. Bisexuality and homosexuality are thus demedicalised and destigmatised. This is also applicable to masturbation, which was previously regarded as a medical problem. Moreover, services that are criminalised or prohibited in a medical setting are demedicalised (see Halfman <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">2012</CitationRef>). If abortion is proscribed or outlawed in a state, it means that it is not in the domain of medical practice.

Every part of the body (fingers, nails, hair, eyes, nose, legs, ears, neck, thighs, skin, mouth, chest, tummy, and particularly the private/sexual parts—the penis, vagina, and breasts) becomes medicalised in order to beautify or improve its image.

The media also has a role in the medicalisation of beauty. The media representation of slimness as a sign of beauty generates the desire for the slim body figure and the freshness of the skin; women are expected to possess moderate hips, small or moderate breasts, decorate or paint (or tattoo) the body, make the breasts and the buttocks firm, maintain a flat tummy (stomach), have a soft/mellow voice, and have full lips and decorative nails.

Many individuals move from simple to advanced medical procedures to recreate their body parts. Africa is not left out, it accounted for 1.7 % of cosmetic surgeries performed in 2010 (ISAPS <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">2011</CitationRef>). Since enhancement pills can be ordered without medical encounter, the use of non-surgical procedures remains largely undocumented. The rise of the medicalisation of beauty also holds enormous implications for human societies. Cosmetic enhancement can improve social relations and boost self-esteem. Many of the procedures can lead to adverse events. The use of unregulated pills and injections could amount to safety risks. More so, it can lead to unwarranted demand (bandwagon effects) of such procedures among healthy individuals. There is a growing obsession with medicalised beautification.

          <Para TextBreak="No">Client-practitioner (also called doctor-patient) relations still remain a fundamental aspect of care. There are frequent encounters between the care seekers and caregivers in the process of health care, and the nature of such relations affect the outcome of care. The client-practitioner relationship<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Client-practitioner relationship</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> refers to the ways in which health workers and lay people (also referred to as clients or patients) interact during a medical consultation (Gabe et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2004</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm>. There has been a gradual shift from the domination of the doctors to the maximisation of inputs from the clients in medical care. The major thesis is that while the “physicians may be experts on the medical facts of a patient’s condition, those facts are never sufficient to specify a course of treatment; clinical decisions must always include consideration of the values and preferences of the patient” (Truog <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">2012</CitationRef>, p. 581)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>, bioethics, and other allied disciplines. It should be noted that while there are a number of practitioners involved in the care process, the focus here will be on the physician. It is important to study client-practitioner relations because it significantly affects the utilisation of health facilities, quality and outcomes of care, clients’ satisfaction and because of ethical challenges that often arise in the course of such relationships. Client-practitioner relations is a domain of power relations<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                </IndexTerm>, a form of medical monopoly of decision and approach in the treatment of patients. This is the traditional approach in medical care before it underwent considerable transformation in the 1960s. The model places the patient in a passive and compliant role. This is why it is often referred to as the activity-passivity model. It is a feature of the sick role<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Sick role</Primary>
                </IndexTerm>, where the patient’s obligation is to seek competent help and cooperate with the physician (Parsons <CitationRef CitationID="CR38">1951</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Parsons, T.</Primary>
                </IndexTerm>. In the paternalistic approach, the treating physician weighs the benefits and risks of each option alone or in consultation with other physicians and makes a decision based on clinical judgment and experience (Charles et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">1999</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Charles, C.</Primary>
                </IndexTerm>. It is assumed that the client lacks the technical knowledge in medical care and should rely on the expertise of the physician who is positioned to serve the client’s interest. This requires an absolute transfer of trust in service delivery.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No"> This model is a typical notion of the <Emphasis Type="Italic">physician is always right</Emphasis>. He/she is a professional guided by professional principles. Therefore, the physician acts like a parent or guardian who directs and implements the best options available, regardless of the client’s preferences. When assessing the values of the patients, the physician utilises universal and objective measures. In this case, the physician plays an authoritative role and could impose treatment if need be, so far as it promotes the well-being of the client. When there are tensions between autonomy<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Autonomy</Primary>
                </IndexTerm> and well-being or choice and health, the physician’s choice will always take precedence (Emanuel and Emanuel <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">1992</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Para TextBreak="No">While there are ethical concerns regarding this model because it undermines the values, freedom, and autonomy of the clients, it could be appropriate in some instances.

Apart from these extreme situations, paternalism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                </IndexTerm>, also called the informed decision-making model, the physician provides relevant factual information to the clients regarding his/her condition and therapeutic options. The information should be adequate to enable the client to select an appropriate course of therapy. The physician informs the patient of his or her disease state, the nature of possible diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the nature and probability of risks, possible medical interventions, benefits and adverse events associated with the therapies, areas of medical expertise available or otherwise, and any uncertainties in knowledge (Emanuel and Emanuel <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">1992</CitationRef>, p. 2221)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                </IndexTerm>. The client then makes an informed decision thereby exercising control over medical care. The major duty of the physician is to cooperate with the clients by implementing his/her informed choices. In the informed model, the patient takes responsibility of therapeutic decision. It is assumed that with adequate information, the clients can make the best decision for themselves (Charles et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">1999</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Para TextBreak="No">The values of the client determine the choice, but such values might be far from medical facts or best technical options. For instance, a client may turn down a blood transfusion because of religious values even when it is the most appropriate medical option. The informative model undermines the values of the physician. The physician assumes the role of a technical expert and provides truthful and comprehensive information. He/she has to respect the informed choices of the clients. One major grey area is that this model is only applicable to a competent client. Also about the nature of diseases, in many cases of acute or accident<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Accidents</Primary>
                </IndexTerm>, there might not be an opportunity for explanations or interaction with clients. Most of those conditions require timely intervention (to save life).</Para>

                  <Primary>Informed consent</Primary>
                </IndexTerm> (in bioethics), the model is the best for obtaining legal authority to proceed with medical intervention after documented informed consent. The informed consent transfers the legal obligation of care to the physician. In case of incompetent clients, the informed consent can be obtained from a legal guardian. Another major issue in the informative decision-making is time. A physician (especially a general practitioner) often has a limited amount of time with each patient. This might affect the amount of information offered and the opportunity for the client to adequately digest the information provided before making a decision. Limited time can be further constrained by limited knowledge. The physician can only offer therapy options known to him/her at a particular moment (Wirtz et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR49">2006</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The client then relates his or her values in manners understandable to the physician who then interprets and provides medical interventions that best realise the specific values and aspirations of the client. In this model, the physician needs some form of cultural competence to be able to comprehend the patient as a situated sociocultural being in order to appreciate the inputs of the clients in the care process.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The corresponding model is the activity-guidance model in which the physician acts based on the guidance or information provided by the client. Before action is taken, the physician counsels the client. According to Charles (<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">1999</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Charles, C.</Primary>
                </IndexTerm>, the information that a patient might reveal to the physician includes aspects of health history, lifestyle, social context (e.g., work and family responsibilities and relationships), health and treatment-related beliefs and fears, and previous treatment (e.g., self-medication)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                </IndexTerm> used. This model is also appropriate for a competent client. It is open to misinterpretation because it could be difficult for the physician to have an emphatic experience with the patient—in terms of illness and sociocultural experiences.
