                <Heading>Background</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par1">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that mothers exclusively breastfeed for the first 6 months of an infant’s life. In Ireland, currently paid maternity leave is 26 weeks and the expectant mother is required by law to finish work 2 weeks before her expected delivery date. Mothers wishing to exclusively breastfeed for 6 months or longer find themselves having to take holiday leave or unpaid leave from work in order to meet the WHO’s guidelines. The aim of this study is to explore women’s experiences of breastfeeding after their return to work in Ireland.</Para>

              <AbstractSection ID="ASec2">
                <Heading>Methods</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par2">This study was carried out utilizing a qualitative design. Initially 25 women who returned to the workforce while continuing to breastfeed were contacted, 16 women returned consent forms and were subsequently contacted to take part in an interview. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was employed to establish recurring patterns and themes throughout the interviews.</Para>

                <Heading>Results</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par3">Women noted that cultural attitudes in Ireland coupled with inadequate or inconsistent advice from health professionals posed the biggest challenge they had to overcome in order to achieve to 6 months exclusive breastfeeding. The findings of this study illustrate that mothers with the desire to continue to breastfeed after their return to work did so with some difficulty. Many did not disclose to their employers that they were breastfeeding and did not make enquiries about being facilitated to continue to breastfeed after their return to the workplace. The perceived lack of support from their employers as well as embarrassment about their breastfeeding status meant many women concealed that they were breastfeeding after their return to the workplace.</Para>

                <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par4">While it has been suggested that WHO guidelines for exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months may be unattainable for many women due to work commitments, a different problem exists in Ireland. Mothers struggle to overcome cultural and societal obstacles coupled with inadequate support from health professionals. Encouraging and facilitating women to continue to breastfeed after they return to work will help to normalise breastfeeding within Irish culture and promote continued breastfeeding as a viable option for working mothers.</Para>

              <Heading>Background</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par5">Breastfeeding has long been established as the optimal source of nourishment for babies, it is more than just nutrition as it is a living fluid that provides a complex mix of hormones, antibodies and enzymes that are unique to mother and baby which cannot be replicated in formula milk preparations [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Since it has been acknowledged that breastfeeding is the superior feeding method for babies, it needs to be protected, supported and promoted even after the mother returns to work [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. Galtry examined the the impact on breastfeeding of labour market policy and practice in Ireland, Sweden, and the USA, however the number of women who return to work and continue to breastfeed in Ireland is unknown [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Lactation breaks are protected in law solely for the period of 26 weeks post birth of the baby [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. In recent years the statutory maternity leave in Ireland has increased from 18 weeks to 26 weeks, although there was provision for lactation breaks in the workplace of up to 1 h per day until 26 weeks post partum without the loss of pay, it was not revised in the 2004 legislation to reflect the increase of statutory maternity leave, hence the legislative protection for lactation breaks in the work place is not reflective of the current paid maternity leave period [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. This is the first study into the experiences of mothers who continue to breastfeed after their return to work in Ireland.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par6">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life and some breastfeeding should continue up until the age of 2 years old and beyond [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. While it has been suggested that the WHO guidelines for exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months may be unattainable for many women due to work commitments or personal circumstances, a different problem exists in Ireland, with Irish mothers struggling to even initiate breastfeeding [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. The rates of mothers who exclusive feeding at 6 months in the Republic of Ireland is 2.4 % [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>] and extended breastfeeding is quite uncommon. This is a cultural as well as a societal problem as we do not traditionally nurse infants for this length of time. The recent arrival of an immigrant population has seen the rates of breastfeeding increase in the Republic of Ireland, however research has shown the longer a mother is resident in the Republic of Ireland the less likely she is to breastfeed her infant regardless of her nationality [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par7">Ireland had target goals for increased breastfeeding initiation and duration rates by the year 2000, it was envisioned that at least 30 % of all women would be breastfeeding their babies at 4 months at the beginning of the new millennium, a target which it failed to meet [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par8">In an Irish context Tarrant and Kearney found that mothers who chose not to breastfeed placed little value on the benefits of breastfeeding, this may be reflecting the overall negative cultural perception of the practice [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>], additionally the principal reasons for early cessation appear to be associated with maternal related factors such as having an inadequate breast milk supply to nourish the infant as well as maternal stress and fatigue [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par9">The aim of this study is to investigate the barriers to returning to work for breastfeeding mothers and to look at the experiences of mothers who continued to provide breastmilk for their babies after their return to the paid workforce.</Para>

                <Heading>Recruitment</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par10">Women were contacted initially through a breastfeeding support website (friendsofirishbreastfeeding.ie) and a private lactation consultant. Women who expressed an interest in participating gave permission for their contact details to be provided to the researcher, who were then contacted via email. Of the 25 women initially contacted 12 replied. All women who had continued to breastfeed after their return to work in Ireland were included in the study. All participants apart from one women were Irish by birth. The professions of the women was not asked to protect anonymity. Study information and consent form were forwarded to the participants with a stamped self-addressed envelope so the participants could return the completed consent form. Once consent was received interviews were organised.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par11">Five additional women were recruited through snowballing. This involved women who participated in the study telling other women they knew who had also returned to work while breastfeeding and those women then volunteering to participate in the study. These women contacted the researcher directly and the researcher then followed the protocol as set out above to include these women in the study.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par12">One participant subsequently contacted the researcher and asked that her contribution not be used in the study as she was currently on work experience and was concerned that she may prejudice future career prospects because of her breastfeeding while on work experience. This interview was deleted immediately upon request and no data provided has been included in this study. This brought the final number of participants in this study to 16. The Topic guide was used as an aid during interviews (Additional file <InternalRef RefID="MOESM1">1</InternalRef>). To ensure rigour, the transcripts of all recordings and were firstly transcribed, checked by DD, and then reviewed by SM.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par13">A qualitative research methodology was used to conduct this study design. Holloway and Wheeler 2004 argue that peoples perspective and ones interpretation of one’s experiences is more evident through qualitative research [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. Pope and Mays 2009 make the point that when you go below the surface of interviews and actually analyse what people have said to you things can appear very differently, they also state that the real strength of qualitative research is induction or interpreting the data, because that is where you find the unexpected [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. Braun and Clarke 2006 argue that qualitative approaches to research are incredibly diverse and complex and that thematic analysis has the benefit of being flexible [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]. Through its theoretical freedom, that is, not being as constrained into a specific framework with which it has to abide, thematic analysis provides a flexible research tool which can potentially provide a rich and detailed, yet complex account of data [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Para ID="Par15">Thematic analysis as described by Braun and Clarke [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>] was used as the method for data analysis. This involved reading and rereading of the transcribed text to familiarise the researcher with the data and to identify preliminary patterns and themes. This initial step allowed the researcher to allocate basic codes to the themes that were relevant to the research question. The codes were then organised into a hierarchical structure for ease of interpretation and divided into themes and sub-themes by devising a mind map. The mind map was then continually refined until a clear picture of the prominent themes emerged with little overlap between the themes. The themes were then grouped into linked dimensions and perspectives for expansion to provide in depth knowledge of the researchers area of interest. The accounts women gave of their experiences were extremely personal to them yet they were repeatedly echoed in the experiences of other women. This repetition of common experiences although unique but similar eventually gave rise to data saturation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>].</Para>

The range of experiences shared by women included negative comments from family and friends to the pressure of breastfeeding in public. Women described how they experienced negative social perceptions of breastfeeding and perceived acceptable length of time for breastfeeding. This was particularly evident when it came to returning to the workplace after maternity leave. Many women did not disclose they were still breastfeeding to managers or colleagues for fear they would be subject to judgement or criticism for continuing to breastfeed after their return to work.<BlockQuote>

Many women felt that the midwives did not give them the attention they needed to feel confident in feeding their baby. All women who had this experience said that it only took one supportive healthcare worker to sit with them and take the time to ensure the baby was latched on properly and the mother was positioned correctly to alleviate their concerns and instil a sense of confidence in the mother regarding her ability to breastfeed.

Many women found breastfeeding support groups particularly helpful for practical and professional information. Internet breastfeeding forums were described as a great source for informal advice and sharing experiences with other breastfeeding mothers. A lot of women found peer support very helpful, especially when family support was lacking. Partners and husbands were repeatedly reported as being the greatest support for the mother and all the women who participated in the study spoke of the practical and emotional support the baby’s father provided during the maternity leave period and after the mother’s return to work.<BlockQuote>

                <Para ID="Par38">The infants feeding routine was of importance at the time of the mothers return to work. Women spoke of the sense of urgency to get a feeding routine established. Some women described the pressure to get their babies onto a bottle before their return to work resulting in emotional stress and anxiety. While many women in this study returned to work on a full time basis and continued to breastfeed, most of the women took unpaid leave (if they could afford to) and returned later than the statutory 26 weeks maternity leave so their babies had been introduced to solid foods. Women referred to their situation as being “very lucky” or “very fortunate” that they could continue to breastfeed after their return to work due to their infant needing less feeds during the day and so they were able to provide some breast milk through expressing which could be given to the infant in a cup or a bottle and the pressure of on demand feeding had ceased. While this may have been fortuitous for the women concerned it was as a result of returning to work when the infant was older than the 6 months that the WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for and their infant had begun on solid foods which naturally decreased the need for breast milk, rather than employers putting provisions in place to support breastfeeding employees.<BlockQuote>

So, there was a lot of things to try and juggle…I was very upset by it and he was, he was 7 months at that stage because I actually weaned him way before because everyone kept saying to me, ‘Oh, you don’t know if he’ll take the bottle’, and, you know, ‘You really have to push it onto him’, you know, all this kind of stuff…So, I forced him into it before he was probably ready and, yeah, it was very upsetting for me. I wasn’t ready. I didn’t think he was ready either but I, I did it anyway.

The expression of breast milk was an issue for many women, it was reported that many women disliked pumping breast milk describing the process was either unpleasant or undignified or both. The women in this study all described difficulties with lack of facilities to express and store breast milk while at work. The storage of the expressed milk was also an issue for some women who had no facility to store the milk in the workplace and had to bring ice packs and cooler bags to work with them in order to store their milk. They also spoke of the lack of time available to them to express milk during their working day.

They said that was fine, no problem but there is no such thing as anyone coming to you and saying “look you go away now and take your break to pump”, it wasn’t like that, it was like well you can fit it into your own day.

Just one more thing, the maternity leave is not long enough here, the baby is still feeding constantly when you have to go back to work so it is not possible to feed for 6 months (Age 34, breastfed for 2 years).</Para>

              <Para ID="Par61">A review of the literature was undertaken to determine the rates and duration breastfeeding in the Republic of Ireland as well as the rates of women who return to work while breastfeeding in the Republic of Ireland. While there are numerous articles relating to breastfeeding and its benefits, the literature in relation to breastfeeding for 6 months or more in an Irish context is very scant. “Although low breast-feeding rates, both traditionally and currently, remain a national public health issue, it is a further concern that very limited high-quality breast-feeding and infant feeding data exist in Ireland” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. There was no literature in relation to the rates of women who return to work while continuing to breastfeed in the Republic of Ireland.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par62">The results of this study show that women in this study in Ireland who choose to breastfeed are often met with an array of challenges. Social stigma, lack of consistent or conflicting advice from healthcare practitioners and inadequate maternity leave appeared to make breastfeeding an unattractive feeding choice for many mothers. Women who chose to breastfeed for 6 months or longer all demonstrated a fierce determination to do so, overcoming all of the challenges they encountered.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par63">The practice of breastfeeding has been lost to generations of Irish women due the steep decline in breastfeeding rates from 64 % in the 1950s to 16 % in 1975 as formula feeding has become an accepted feature of life in Ireland [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. The Republic of Ireland currently has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in Europe with only 55.4 % of all women initiating breastfeeding, 42 % breastfeeding at 48 h or at discharge and 19 % continuing to breastfeed at 2–3 months [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Our study indicated that information provision from health professionals varied greatly and many women were given inconsistent or conflicting advice. Mothers found that some midwives were encouraging and supportive of breastfeeding, others recommended formula feeding. The advice from public health nurses often conflicted with the advice the mother received in the hospital resulting in mothers seeking the services of private lactation consultants or Le Leche League support groups for advice. A number of women found peer advice very helpful, particularly when professional advice was absent. Our data suggest that health professionals need to give encouraging and consistent advice to expectant mothers’ right through pregnancy and after birth in order to inspire confidence and self-efficacy in women regarding their ability to breastfeed.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par64">Our findings show that there is a lack of social approval for breastfeeding mothers and breastfeeding in the workplace is not encouraged. This finding is in line with Gatrell who stated that mothers faced difficulty as breastfeeding within the workplace is considered ‘taboo’ [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. She further noted that for mothers to comply with workplace requirements they were either obliged to cease breastfeeding or to conceal breastfeeding activities [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>], this was also the case for some women in this study. Lack of supportive work environments, lactation facilities and the period of paid maternity leave have all been cited as barriers to breastfeeding in the workplace [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. Similarly, the women in this study experienced emotional pressures and anxieties when they were due to return or had returned to the workplace. The financial implications of taking extra maternity leave was an issue for some women and they had to return to work at the end of the statutory maternity leave. Women found the lack of facilities and supports for breastfeeding mothers in their workplace as a major barrier to continued breastfeeding. Hawkins et al., suggests that mothers who are employed on a full time basis are more likely to initiate breastfeeding if their employer offered supportive breastfeeding arrangements [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. Greater efforts are needed to positively promote breastfeeding at all levels of society and reverse the negative attitudes towards breastfeeding in Ireland [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Heading>Strengths and limitations</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par65">This study was strengthened by the use of a qualitative design study. The information gathered was very rich and detailed but also very personal in nature. This divulging of sensitive information was facilitated through the conversation between the participant and the researcher and yielded very interesting data relating to the women’s beliefs and opinions as well as their experiences. Although it was a relatively small sample size the experiences of the women shared many similarities. In addition, the constant comparative method was utilised [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>] and following these interviews no additional information or new themes were rasised by participants. This in turn lead the researchers to believe that data saturation had been reached [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]. However qualitative data has its limitations as the data are not generalizable [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. Although the recounting of experiences is subjective, theparticipants from this study shared many unique though similar experiences. The findings of this study are similar to quantitative studies reported elsewhere and would be interesting to see if similar findings would be found if the study were repeated elsewhere. This study was limited by the lack of previous research carried out investigating mothers who continue to breastfeed after their return to work in Ireland. The lack of comparable data into challenges faced by women in Irish workplaces who wish to continue to breastfeed after their return to work suggests that further investigation into this area is needed.</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par66">Upon their return to the workplace many women find that they do not have any legislative protection for lactation breaks to either express breast milk to feed at a later time or to feed their infant on the premises if facilities are available. Lactation breaks are protected in law solely for the period of 26 weeks post birth of the baby [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. In recent years the statutory maternity leave in Ireland has increased from 18 weeks to 26 weeks, although there was provision for lactation breaks in the workplace of up to 1 h per day until 26 weeks postpartum without the loss of pay, it was not revised in the 2004 legislation to reflect the increase of statutory maternity leave, hence the legislative protection for lactation breaks in the work place is not reflective of the current paid maternity leave period [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. Extending paid maternity leave and introducing paid lactation breaks for all women who want to continue to breastfeed may encourage more women to feed after their return to work.</Para>
