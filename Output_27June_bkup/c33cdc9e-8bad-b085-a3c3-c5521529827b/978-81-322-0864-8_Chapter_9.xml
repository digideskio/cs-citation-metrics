          <Para TextBreak="No">Statistics is the study of the collection, organisation and interpretation of data. Statistics is considered to be a mathematical science, and it pertains to the collection of data, analysis, interpretation or explanation and presentation of data, while others consider it a branch of mathematics concerned with collecting and interpreting data. As it has its empirical roots and its focus on applications, statistics is usually considered to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics. Statisticians improve the quality of data with the designing of experiments and survey sampling. Statistics also provides tools for prediction and forecasting using data and statistical models. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial or societal problem, it is necessary to begin with a population or process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as ‘all persons living in a country’ or ‘every atom composing a crystal’. A population can also be composed of observations of a process at various times, with the data from each observation serving as a different member of the overall group. Data collected about this kind of ‘population’ constitutes what is called a time series. Traditionally, statistics was concerned with drawing inferences using a semi-standardised methodology that was ‘required learning’ in most sciences. This has changed with use of statistics in non-inferential contexts. What was once considered a dry subject, taken in many fields as a degree requirement, is now viewed enthusiastically. Initially derided by some mathematical purists, it is now considered essential methodology in certain areas.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Statics is the study of the collection, organisation and interpretation of data (Dodge <CitationRef CitationID="CR00093">2003</CitationRef>). It deals with all aspects, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. Statistical analyst is one who is well versed in the ways of thinking and applies successfully the data for statistical analysis. The experience is gained by working in a number of fields. There is also a discipline called mathematical statistics, which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject.</Para>

          <Heading>Scope</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Statistics is considered to be a mathematical science, and it pertains to the collection of data, analysis, interpretation or explanation and presentation of data (Moses <CitationRef CitationID="CR00096">1986</CitationRef>), while others consider it a branch of mathematics (Hay <CitationRef CitationID="CR00094">1973</CitationRef>). It is concerned mainly with collecting and interpreting data. As it has its empirical roots and its focus on applications, statistics is usually considered to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics (Moore <CitationRef CitationID="CR00095">1992</CitationRef>; Chance et al <CitationRef CitationID="CR00092">2005</CitationRef>). Statisticians improve the quality of data with the designing of experiments and survey sampling. Statistics also provides tools for prediction and forecasting using data and statistical models. Statistics is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines, including natural and social sciences, government and business. Statistical consultants are available to provide help for organisations and companies without direct access to expertise relevant to their particular problems. Descriptive statistics can be used to summarise or describe a collection of data which is useful in research when communicating the results of experiments. Inferential statistics in a way accounts for randomness and uncertainty in the observations. This data is used to draw inferences about the process or population being studied. Inference is a vital element of scientific advance, since it provides a prediction (based in data) for where a theory logically leads. These predictions are part of the scientific method. If the inference holds true, then the descriptive statistics of the new data increases the soundness of that hypothesis. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics together comprise applied statistics.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Statistics is closely related to probability theory, with which it is often grouped. The difference is roughly that in probability theory, one starts from the given parameters of a total population to deduce probabilities pertaining to samples, but statistical inference moves in the opposite direction, inductive inference from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population.</Para>

        <Section1 ID="Sec00093">
          <Heading>Application of Statistics</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial or societal problem, it is necessary to begin with a population or process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as ‘all persons living in a country’ or ‘every atom composing a crystal’. A population can also be composed of observations of a process at various times, with the data from each observation serving as a different member of the overall group. Data collected about this kind of ‘population’ constitutes what is called a time series.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">For practical reasons, a chosen subset of the population called a sample is studied—as opposed to compiling data about the entire group (an operation called census). Once a sample that is representative of the population is determined, data are collected for the sample members in an observational or experimental setting. These data can then be subjected to statistical analysis, serving two related purposes: description and inference.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Descriptive statistics summarise the population data by describing what was observed in the sample numerically or graphically. Numerical descriptors include mean and standard deviation for continuous data types (like heights or weights), while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing categorical data (like race).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Inferential statistics uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented, accounting for randomness. These inferences may take the form of answering yes/no questions about the data, or one can use it for hypothesis testing, estimating numerical characteristics of the data, describing associations within the data, that is, one can find out correlation, and modelling relationships within the data. One example is using regression analysis. Inference can extend to forecasting, prediction and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied. It can also include extrapolation and interpolation of time series or spatial data and can also include data mining (Leo Breiman <CitationRef CitationID="CR00091">2001</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy for the potential confusion it can cause. Statistical analysis of a data set often reveals that two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary together, as if they were connected. For example, a study of annual income that also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated. However, they may or may not be the cause of one another. The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable or confounding variable. For this reason, there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables. For a sample to be used as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it is truly a representative of that overall population. Representative sampling assures that the inferences and conclusions can be safely extended from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent to which the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any random trending within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population. Statisticians describe stronger methods as more ‘robust’.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Randomness is studied using the mathematical discipline of probability theory. Probability is used in ‘mathematical statistics’ to study the sampling distributions of sample statistics, and in more general terms, the properties of statistical procedures can also be studied. The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Misuse of statistics can produce subtle but serious errors in description and interpretation—subtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors. For instance, social policy, medical practice and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Even when statistical techniques are correctly applied, then also the results are also very difficult to interpret for those people who are not experts in this field. The statistical significance of a trend in the data—which measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sample—may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. Statistical literacy is the set of basic statistical skills (and scepticism) that people need to deal with information in their day-to-day lives.</Para>

            <Heading>Experimental and Observational Studies</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">A common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate causality and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on dependent variables or response. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: experimental studies and observational studies. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behaviour of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation. Instead, data are gathered, and correlations between predictors and response are investigated.</Para>

The famous Hawthorne study examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company. The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the assembly line workers. The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity. It turned out that productivity improved under the experimental conditions. However, the study is heavily criticised today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a control, group and blindness.</Para>

This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis.

            <Para TextBreak="No">There are four main levels of measurement used in statistics: nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio (Thompson <CitationRef CitationID="CR00098">2006</CitationRef>). Each of these has different degrees of usefulness in statistical research. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined. They provide the greatest flexibility in statistical methods that can be used for analysing the data. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary. For example in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in Celsius or Fahrenheit. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values but have a meaningful order to those values. Nominal measurements have no meaningful rank order among values.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Since variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically that is why sometimes they are grouped together as categorical variables, ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative or continuous variables due to their numerical nature.</Para>

            <Heading>Null Hypothesis</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a null hypothesis in that the assumption is that whatever is proposed as a cause has no effect on the variable being measured. The best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a jury trial. The null hypothesis, H<Subscript>0</Subscript>, asserts that the defendant is innocent, whereas the alternative hypothesis, H<Subscript>1</Subscript>, asserts that the defendant is guilty. The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt. The H<Subscript>0</Subscript> (status quo) stands in opposition to H<Subscript>1</Subscript> and is maintained unless H<Subscript>1</Subscript> is supported by evidence ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’. However, ‘failure to reject H<Subscript>0</Subscript>’ in this case does not imply innocence, but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict. So the jury does not necessarily <Emphasis Type="Italic">accept</Emphasis> H<Subscript>0</Subscript> but <Emphasis Type="Italic">fails to reject</Emphasis> H<Subscript>0</Subscript>. While one cannot ‘prove’ a null hypothesis, one can test how close it is to being true with a power test, which tests for type II errors.</Para>

Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic (bias), but other important types of errors (e.g. blunder, when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also be important.</Para>

            <Heading>Interval Estimation</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Most studies are for only part of a sample population, and so the results are not fully representative of the whole population. Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value. Confidence intervals allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population. Often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. Formally, a 95% confidence interval for a value is a range where, if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions (yielding a different dataset), the interval would include the true (population) value 95% of the time. This does not imply that the probability is the true value in the confidence interval, that is, 95%. From the frequentist perspective, such a claim does not even make sense, as the true value is not a random variable. Either the true value is or is not within the given interval. However, it is true that, before any data are sampled and given a plan for how the confidence interval will be constructed, the probability is 95% that the yet-to-be-calculated interval will cover the true value: At this point, the limits of the interval are yet-to-be-observed random variables. One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a credible interval from Bayesian statistics: This approach depends on a different way of interpreting what is meant by ‘probability’, that is, as a Bayesian probability.</Para>

          <Heading>Significance</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Statistics rarely gives a simple yes/no type answer to the question asked. Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis> value).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms. For example, in a large study of a drug, it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect, such that the drug will be unlikely to help the patient in a noticeable way.</Para>

          <Heading>Statistical Computing</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the twentieth century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science. Early statistical models were almost always from the class of linear models, but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical algorithms, caused an increased interest in nonlinear models as well as the creation of new types, such as generalised linear models and multilevel models.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on resampling, such as permutation tests and the bootstrap, while techniques such as Gibbs sampling have made use of Bayesian models more feasible. The computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with new emphasis on ‘experimental’ and ‘empirical’ statistics. A large number of both general and special purpose statistical software are now available.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">There is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all-too-frequently intentionally misused by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favourable to the presenter. If various studies appear to contradict one another, then the public may come to distrust such studies. For example, one study may suggest that a given diet or activity raises blood pressure, while another may suggest that it lowers blood pressure. The discrepancy can arise from subtle variations in experimental design, such as differences in the patient groups or research protocols, which are not easily understood by the nonexpert. By choosing (or rejecting or modifying) a certain sample, results can be manipulated. Such manipulations need not be malicious or devious; they can arise from unintentional biases of the researcher. The graphs used to summarise data can also be misleading. Deeper criticisms come from the fact that the hypothesis is a testing approach, widely used and in many cases required by law or regulation, forces one hypothesis (the null hypothesis) to be ‘favoured’ and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies. A difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance. One response is by giving a greater emphasis on the <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis> value than simply reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected at the given level of significance. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis> value, however, does not indicate the size of the effect. Another increasingly common approach is to report confidence intervals. Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis> values, they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it.</Para>
