Worksite health and wellness promotion can be comprised of specific programs and services, employer policies and procedures, financial benefits and incentives, and changes in workplace culture or environment. Specific programs focusing on smoking cessation, weight reduction, or health risk appraisal have shown a moderate level of success and economic benefit, but the greatest impact has been for comprehensive wellness programs that include multiple initiatives, involve environmental and cultural changes in the workplace, and are tailored to meet the unique circumstances of organizations, employee health concerns, and work settings. Researchers of worksite wellness programs have emphasized the importance of environmental changes to support healthy lifestyles, the need to integrate wellness activities across organizational divisions, and attention to primary, secondary, and tertiary disease and injury prevention opportunities. For countries with an aging workforce and a growing number of chronic health conditions (e.g., USA), health and wellness promotion efforts within the workplace are likely to become more commonplace and more expansive in the coming years.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Worksite wellness is a relative newcomer to the professional field of occupational health, and there is tremendous variability in employer programs and initiatives intended to support employee health and wellness across occupational settings and around the world. Many questions remain about the health benefits and cost effectiveness of these formal and informal strategies to improve employee health, but most of the research evidence so far has supported their effectiveness provided the programs are sufficiently comprehensive, far-reaching, and targeted to the specific needs of individual workers and occupational settings (Carnethon et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001718">2009</CitationRef>; Pelletier, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001764">2011</CitationRef>; Soler et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001778">2010</CitationRef>). Today, the concept of worksite wellness includes attention to both the physical and psychosocial well-being of workers (Levy, Wegman, Baron, &amp; Sokas, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001746">2011</CitationRef>), and health promotion efforts fall within primary, secondary, and tertiary aspects of disease and disability prevention (Harris, Lichiello, &amp; Hannon, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001731">2009</CitationRef>). With an aging workforce and proliferation of chronic health conditions among workers in the US and ­elsewhere (Caban-Martinez et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001714">2011</CitationRef>; Szinovacz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001782">2011</CitationRef>), employers are likely to dedicate more attention and resources to preventing and dealing with serious health problems in the workplace of the future. While disability benefits and other health insurance programs are in place in most industrialized nations as a safety net for ill workers, health promotion and early intervention programs may become more commonplace as an employer-supported or workplace-centered effort.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">While employers have had a vested interest in worker health and well-being for centuries, formal systems to promote worker health have evolved substantially since the rapid industrialization of the late nineteenth century. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig00171">17.1</InternalRef> shows a historical timeline developed by Anttonen and Pääkkönen (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00179">2010</CitationRef>) as an illustration of how the concept of well-being at work has been transformed over the past 150 years in Finland. This timeline is representative of the changes in many industrialized nations during this time period. The early focus was on reengineering workplace processes, machinery, and environments to prevent deaths, amputations, and disabling injuries that came with industrialization. Few laws were in place to protect the health of the labor force, and hiring decisions often focused on whether candidates had sufficient physical strength and endurance to perform job tasks (Aldrich, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00173">1997</CitationRef>).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00171">

              <Para TextBreak="No">In the early twentieth century, many countries enacted laws governing workplace safety and enabling employers or government sectors to provide insurance, healthcare, and disability benefits to workers. In the decades that followed, there was growing scientific evidence of environmental and physical hazards in the workplace, and substantial improvements in workplace health and safety ensued. Around the 1980s, the concept of worksite wellness began to expand beyond worksite safety to include other issues as well. Problems like job stress, work-family conflict, sedentary work, ­second-hand smoke, and repetitive motion emerged as workplace issues, alongside physical force requirements and chemical and particulate exposures (Karasek &amp; Theorell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001738">1990</CitationRef>). More recently, researchers have focused on the more complex interactions between health and work: presenteeism; the negative health effects of job stress and low decision latitude; the benefits of job accommodation; return-to-work strategies; social support in the workplace; and employer support of healthy lifestyles (Akabas, Gates, &amp; Galvin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00171">1992</CitationRef>; Quick &amp; Tetrick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001768">2003</CitationRef>; Talmage &amp; Melhorn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001783">2005</CitationRef>). More research has documented the substantial employer and societal costs attributable to poor employee health (Institute of Medicine, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001736">1997</CitationRef>), and employers have begun to consider the economic and organizational benefits of having a healthier workforce (Koper, Moller, &amp; Zwetsloot, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001740">2009</CitationRef>; Whitehead, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001794">2001</CitationRef>). All of these changes have led to a broader perspective of worksite wellness that addresses not just workplace safety, but issues of worker productivity and sustainability, well-being, organizational factors, lifestyle choices, home safety, and disease management. The number of employers offering workplace wellness programs with financial incentives to employees in the US has been steadily rising despite a recessionary economic environment (National Business Group on Health, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001756">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Although the concept of worksite wellness encompasses many domains and potential research questions, this chapter summarizes key research findings in six aspects of worksite wellness that have been the subject of multiple research studies: dietary and physical activity interventions; smoking cessation interventions; health-risk appraisal and tailored health advice; comprehensive wellness programs; integration of workplace health and safety policies and practices; and economic evidence. Each of these elements is summarized and discussed in the sections that follow.</Para>

              <Heading>Dietary and Physical Activity Interventions at the Workplace</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Maintaining the balance between energy intake (nutrition) and energy expenditure (physical activity) is an increasing problem for workers worldwide. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is on the rise and, despite excessive attempts to reverse the trend, obesity is expected to become the main determinant of preventable burden of disease in the future (Peeters et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001761">2003</CitationRef>; Popkin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001766">2006</CitationRef>). Recent estimates show that only 34% of U.S. workers are classified as normal weight compared to 44% in the late 1980s, while 29% are classified as obese (Hertz &amp; McDonald, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001732">2004</CitationRef>). In the workplace, ­obesity accounts for costs associated with injuries, disability, absenteeism, sick leave, and healthcare claims (Ostbye, Dement, &amp; Krause, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001760">2007</CitationRef>). In response to this, research on dietary and physical ­activity interventions has been expanding both in quantity and in quality the last decades. Also, there has been a shift of focus away from interventions aiming at reducing obesity and towards a focus on attempts to prevent obesity (Lemmens, Oenema, Klepp, Henriksen, &amp; Brug, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001745">2008</CitationRef>). The preventive approach has proven to be less expensive and potentially more effective than treating a fully developed obesity problem.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Working adults spend a lot of their time at the workplace. Up to 60% of employees’ waking hours are spent at the worksite, and the occupational setting has therefore been suggested as an opportunity to promote a healthy lifestyle among workers. A range of different worksite health promotion programs have been conducted and studied over the years, ranging in quality and efficiency. Recent developments have demonstrated that, in order to succeed in significant behavior change in the target populations, health promotion strategies need to go beyond education or communication alone, and add environmental modifications to the worksite as well (Engbers, van Poppel, Chin, &amp; van Mechelen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001726">2005</CitationRef>). Employees’ dietary behavior is not only determined by conscious choices, but also by unconscious processes (or habits), which is why changes in the physical environment have proven to be so useful. Environmental strategies aim to make healthy choices easier (e.g., by access to healthy foods, enhancing opportunities to physical activity, etc.). They target the whole work force by modifying physical or organizational structures, as opposed to behavioral and societal strategies where the aim is to influence behaviors indirectly by targeting individual cognition believed to mediate behavior change (Anderson et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00176">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Several studies of workplace interventions have investigated the effects of targeting physical activity, dietary behavior, or both, in attempts of preventing weight gain. The overall findings from systematic literature reviews show favorable effects of both physical activity and dietary behavior on weight outcomes (Anderson et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00176">2009</CitationRef>) and on fruit, vegetable and fat intake (Engbers et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001726">2005</CitationRef>). The effect seems to be consistent, albeit somewhat modest. In the systematic review by Anderson et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00176">2009</CitationRef>), a net loss of 2.8 lb were seen at 6–12 months follow-up, with similar effects observed for the studies that could not be included in the meta-analysis. The evidence for potential differences between ­program components (information, behavioral skills, or environmental and policy) was limited, but the overall findings showed that more intensive modes of interventions were associated with increased program impact. That is, more structured programs were more effective than unstructured programs, and adding behavioral counseling to educational information was more beneficial than information alone (Anderson et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00176">2009</CitationRef>). This is further in line with studies finding that those health behavior interventions that are effective tend to involve more intensive and sustained interventions with longer-term coaching and follow-up (Lemmens et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001745">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Worksite interventions that focus exclusively on physical activity do not show very convincing effects, and they have yet to demonstrate a statistically significant increase in physical activity or fitness (Dishman, Oldenburg, O’Neal, &amp; Shephard, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001724">1998</CitationRef>; Engbers et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001726">2005</CitationRef>). Most studies included in a systematic review concerning physical activity interventions were found to have serious design flaws, and the only moderating variable that significantly influenced the size of the intervention effects was research design, with quasi-experimental designs showing larger effects than randomized controlled designs (Dishman et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001724">1998</CitationRef>). Furthermore, few of the worksite health promotion programs included environmental modifications to stimulate physical activity, which could be one explanation for the lack of documented effects (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001726">Engbers et al.</CitationRef>). However, whether an intervention is effective or not always depends on the outcome it is measured by. Hence, another systematic review on the same topic, but with different outcomes and criteria, concluded that there is strong evidence for a positive effect of worksite physical activity programs on physical activity and musculoskeletal disorders (Proper et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001767">2003</CitationRef>). The different conclusions are primarily the result of differences in methods of reviewing (qualitative in the latter; quantitative in the former), differences in included outcomes (other health outcomes besides fitness included in the latter), and different inclusion criteria for the studies that were included.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Worksite interventions that focus exclusively on promoting a healthy diet show moderate evidence of effect (Maes et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001750">2011</CitationRef>). Particularly effective are educational and multicomponent dietary interventions, with effects showing on dietary behaviors and determinants of such. This particular review found less positive results for nutrition and physical activity interventions combined. This is not quite in line with previous reviews, and this could be a result of systemic and methodological differences. Methodologically, the review included studies with a wide range of different research designs and, systemically, they included only studies from European countries, while most other reviews include studies from non-European countries (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001750">Maes et al.</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In recent years, there has been a gradual shift towards more primary preventive interventions, and less secondary and tertiary prevention efforts for overweight and obesity. While secondary and tertiary prevention is easier to accomplish because of more motivated and easily identified groups of people, primary prevention has proven to be more cost-effective and beneficial in the long run, and seems to be more efficient in addressing the obesity epidemic. Accordingly, a recent systematic review addressed the issue of primary prevention by excluding studies focusing primarily on weight loss, and studies among only overweight or obese populations (Verweij, Coffeng, van Mechelen, &amp; Proper, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001791">2011</CitationRef>). The results showed moderate quality of evidence that workplace physical activity and dietary interventions significantly reduced body weight, body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage. Subgroup analyses revealed that interventions that included an environmental component were more effective in reducing body weight than studies without such components, despite a wide variety of environmental components in the different studies (Verweij et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001791">2011</CitationRef>). For instance, in one of the studies, the worksite program included walking maps, team competitions, participation cards, and participation rewards, and every week a dietician would visit the worksite to give out new material, punch participation cards, give rewards and discuss individual health questions (Racette et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001769">2009</CitationRef>). In another study from Japan, a 4-days health promotion program conducted at a hot spring resort was followed by a follow-up program involving active ­participation from the participant’s supervisor and family (Muto &amp; Yamauchi, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001755">2001</CitationRef>). Both these approaches produced good results that were long ­lasting. This indicates that future studies should look beyond personal components and also include ­environmental components in their worksite health promotion programs.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Most of the research focus on workplace interventions has focused on reducing risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but workplace health promotion activities may also encompass secondary and tertiary prevention efforts once disease processes have led to symptoms, clinical endpoints and diagnoses, and more severe health limitations. In the worksite context, primary prevention would include all of the means intended to protect workers from developing diseases or experiencing injuries. Secondary prevention is to halt or slow the progress of disease or reduce its disabling effects. Tertiary prevention is focused on managing complicated, long-term health problems. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig00172">17.2</InternalRef> shows the multiple ways that workplace health promotion activities might impact workers with regard to cardiovascular disease. Primary prevention strategies might include sponsorship of weight reduction programs, changes in the work environment to support healthy lifestyles, adopting work schedules and other policies that enable healthy behaviors, and financial incentives or gym discounts. For workers with activity-limiting cardiovascular diseases, the employer may play a role by encouraging prompt medical attention, providing affordable health care access, and providing appropriate help from supervisors to manage sickness absence and any functional limitations at work. For workers with more severe cardiovascular events or complications, an employer may be influential by providing worksite accommodations, funding disability benefits, facilitating supervisor and coworker support, and by supporting disease management strategies.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00172">

              <Para TextBreak="No">The financial consequences of obesity involve reduced productivity, but also an increase in ­medical costs in countries with employer-provided health insurance. The financial return of worksite health promotion programs was extensively evaluated in a recent systematic review of programs that aimed to improve nutrition and/or increase physical activity in the workers (van Dongen et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001789">2011</CitationRef>). On average, the financial return was found to be positive; worksite health promotion programs generated financial savings in terms of reduced absenteeism costs, medical costs or both. This is also in line with previous reviews that generally conclude reduced employer-related expenses resulting from worksite health promotion programs (Aldana, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00172">2001</CitationRef>; Chapman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001720">2005</CitationRef>; Soler et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001778">2010</CitationRef>). However, this is only the case for non-randomized studies. Subgroup analysis revealed that the effect was caused by the non-randomized studies in the review, while no significant effects on financial savings could be documented for the randomized controlled trials (van Dongen et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001789">2011</CitationRef>). This raises the issue of the general methodological quality of worksite health promotion studies, and the possibility of <Emphasis Type="Italic">selection bias</Emphasis>. Selection bias arises when allocation methods other than randomization are used, which means that the intervention and control group are unlikely to be comparable. That is probably why non-randomized studies of health care interventions in general tend to result in larger estimates of effect (Kunz, Vist, &amp; Oxman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001742">2007</CitationRef>). Several of the previously mentioned reviews also point to methodological flaws in the included studies, such as the lack of randomization procedures, blinding, co-interventions and intention-to-treat analysis, and suggest paying more attention to this in the future (Verweij et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001791">2011</CitationRef>). On the other hand, there seems to be increasing consensus about the fact that randomized controlled trials often are inappropriate, unachievable, and even irrelevant for public health interventions (Maes et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001750">2011</CitationRef>). The debate on grading of evidence for public health interventions is, in other words, still ongoing, and new frameworks for categorizing interventions have been proposed where certainty of effectiveness and potential population impact are combined in one and the same framework (Swinburn, Gill, &amp; Kumanyika, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001780">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Heading>Workplace Interventions for Smoking Cessation</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Probably no single negative health behavior has received as much research attention in the second half of the twentieth century as tobacco use. The negative health consequences of smoking are now commonly known and well documented (Bullen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001713">2008</CitationRef>; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001788">2010</CitationRef>), and the evidence of tobacco’s negative effect on bodily systems, diseases processes, and population health continues to mount. Smoking rates have seen a slow, steady decline in the US from nearly 50% in 1965 to a current rate of 19.8% among working age adults (Syamlal, Mazurek, &amp; Malarcher, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001781">2011</CitationRef>), but smoking rates are still elevated in some occupational groups (e.g., restaurant and construction workers; Syamlal et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001781">2011</CitationRef>), and the rate is as high as 40–50% in some other regions of the world (World Health Organization, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001795">2011</CitationRef>). The gold standard for smoking cessation is either individual or group behavioral intervention, often augmented with nicotine replacement or other pharmacotherapies (Tonnesen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001785">2009</CitationRef>). These programs show a reasonable level of success, with a 1-year abstinence rate of about 25% (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001785">Tonnesen</CitationRef>), but the majority of individuals quit smoking without any formal intervention. Still, smoking cessation is no simple matter, and like any lifestyle change, it requires motivation, support, and personal fortitude. Employer policies and programs can assist workers in these efforts.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In many countries, the problem of worksite tobacco use and second-hand smoke has been significantly mitigated by legislative and policy changes that prohibit smoking in indoor working environments and in public places such as stores, restaurants, and libraries. Such “smoke-free” policies have not only reduced second-hand smoke exposure, but also reduced smoking rates among employees who face a major inconvenience to smoke during working hours (Gadomski, Stayton, Krupa, &amp; Jenkins, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001727">2010</CitationRef>; Longo, Johnson, Kruse, Brownson, &amp; Hewett, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001749">2001</CitationRef>). Despite these efforts, smoking continues to be a major health and mortality risk among working age adults in the US and elsewhere (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001788">2010</CitationRef>), and the health consequences of smoking generate a significant financial burden to employers and social insurance systems due to increases in chronic medical conditions, increased mortality, more functional limitations, and higher healthcare and disability costs (Goetzel et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001728">2009</CitationRef>; <CitationRef CitationID="CR001788">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</CitationRef>). Such evidence has led the Centers for Disease Control to encourage employers to integrate smoking cessation programs with other worksite health promotion efforts (Syamlal et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001781">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Workplace interventions for smoking cessation can include both individual-level efforts (i.e., helping an individual employee quit smoking) and group-level programs (e.g., bans, restrictions, and health ­messaging). Eight types of workplace interventions were identified in a 2008 systematic review of 51 trials evaluating workplace interventions for smoking cessation (Cahill, Moher, &amp; Lancaster, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001715">2008</CitationRef>). These included the following: (1) intensive group behavioral interventions, (2) individual counseling, (3) self-help interventions (typically of less intensity), (4) pharmacological therapies (typically nicotine replacement), (5) engaging social support (e.g., friend, coworker, or spouse), (6) environmental support (e.g., posters), (7) monetary incentives, and (8) comprehensive programs involving multiple components. The primary conclusion of the systematic review was that group programs, individual counseling and nicotine replacement were effective to increase smoking cessation rates, and this mirrors the results of programs outside of the workplace (Tonnesen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001785">2009</CitationRef>). The review also concluded that more research was needed of incentive schemes and comprehensive worksite programs in order to conclude whether consistent benefits existed across studies. A meta-analysis of worksite smoking cessation programs conducted in 1990 (Smedslund, Fisher, Boles, &amp; Lichtenstein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001777">2004</CitationRef>) and repeated in 2004 (Lee et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001743">2007</CitationRef>) concluded initial effectiveness of worksite programs, but with waning effects beyond 12 months. Thus, the longevity of workplace intervention effects may be deserving of more research.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">One question of importance to employers is whether incentives and/or competitions between working groups might improve enrollment or outcomes of smoking cessation programs. A recent systematic review of worksite-based incentives and competitions found 14 studies of sufficient quality to synthesize results across studies (Leeks et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001744">2010</CitationRef>). The reviewers concluded that incentives and competitions increased the effectiveness of programs by 67%, and this translated to an improvement in 1-year smoking cessation rates by an average of 4.4 percentage points. Thus, there is strong evidence that worksite-based incentives and competitions, in combination with additional interventions, are effective in increasing the number of workers who quit using tobacco. Also, studies have shown net cost savings to employers when program costs are adjusted for averted healthcare expenses and productivity losses (Serxner et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001774">1993</CitationRef>; Tanaka et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001784">2006</CitationRef>). There is no current evidence, however, that incentives and competitions alone are effective to reduce smoking rates when not combined with a formal smoking cessation program.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Most of the research focus on workplace interventions for tobacco use has focused on primary prevention (i.e., smoking cessation), but workplace health promotion activities for tobacco use may involve secondary and tertiary prevention efforts as well. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig00173">17.3</InternalRef> shows the multiple ways that workplace health promotion activities might impact workers with regard to tobacco use and its longer-range health implications. Primary prevention strategies might include a media campaign to quit smoking, sponsorship of smoking cessation programs, financial incentives to quit smoking, and a property-wide ban on smoking. For workers with emerging respiratory symptoms related to tobacco use, the employer may play a role by encouraging prompt medical attention, providing affordable health care access, and providing appropriate help from supervisors to manage sickness absence and any functional limitations at work. For older workers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other complicated smoking-related medical conditions, an employer may be influential by providing worksite accommodations, access to disability benefits, supervisor and coworker support, and by ­supporting disease management strategies.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00173">

              <Para TextBreak="No">For employers contemplating a more aggressive smoking cessation effort in the workplace, the most compelling evidence is the number of deaths and chronic health conditions attributed to smoking, and the high concomitant employer healthcare and disability costs. Smoking still accounts for 30% of all cancer deaths and 80% of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the US (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001719">2007</CitationRef>). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates an annual price tag of $97 billion in productivity losses, and $96 billion for healthcare costs attributable to tobacco use (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001719">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</CitationRef>). Workers who smoke have higher healthcare expenses, higher rates of absenteeism and presenteeism, and are more likely to use short-term disability benefits (Hill, Thompson, Shaw, Pinidiya, &amp; Card-Higginson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001733">2009</CitationRef>; Kowlessar, Goetzel, Carls, Tabrizi, &amp; Guindon, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001741">2011</CitationRef>). For these reasons, providing employees with easy access to smoking cessation programs and promoting their use through incentives and competition is a very critical component to worksite wellness efforts.</Para>

              <Heading>Health Risk Appraisals and Tailored Health Advice</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">One wellness strategy applied in many employment settings is to conduct regular health risk appraisals (HRA), and to provide workers with tailored health advice based on HRA results. This secondary prevention strategy is typically focused on reducing cardiovascular risk factors, but HRAs can also cover issues related to safety practices, personal hygiene, mental stress, and overall fitness planning (Anderson &amp; Staufacker, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00178">1996</CitationRef>; DeFriese &amp; Fielding, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001723">1990</CitationRef>; Soler et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001778">2010</CitationRef>). In some work settings, an HRA might also address a potential workplace health concern (e.g., an audiogram for factory workers with significant noise exposures) or a potential public safety concern (e.g., vision tests for truck drivers). But typically, HRA participation is voluntary and confidential, and an HRA might include biometric screening from a single blood draw coupled with a brief self-report questionnaire describing health habits. HRAs may be recommended at regular intervals or periodic milestones (e.g., after every 5 years with the company) at relatively low cost to the employer (as low as $5–15 per worker), and results are typically delivered to employees in an automated written report with additional explanation or follow-up with a nurse available upon request. More elaborate HRAs can include a full physical exam, medical history, and face-to-face consultation. Cash incentives can increase rates of employee participation (Merrill, Hyatt, Aldana, &amp; Kinnersley, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001753">2011</CitationRef>). Results of the 1999 National Survey of Worksite Health Promotion (Association for Worksite Health Promotion, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001710">1999</CitationRef>) indicated that 35% of companies (57% of large companies) offer HRAs either directly or through their health insurance carriers. Early reviews of the literature on workplace health promotion programs recommended a healthy skepticism given the entrepreneurial and rapid proliferation of prepackaged worksite wellness programs and the limited number of research studies (Alexander, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00174">1988</CitationRef>; <CitationRef CitationID="CR00178">Anderson &amp; Staufacker</CitationRef>; Warner, Wickizer, Wolfe, Schildroth, &amp; Samuelson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001793">1988</CitationRef>), but more recent evidence has supported the usefulness of HRA and tailored advice as a way to direct employees to available health resources and wellness activities (Soler et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001778">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The challenge of measuring the sole impact of HRA and tailored advice is that these represent “gateway” interventions that increase employee awareness and motivation to seek other health care services or engage in other worksite health promotion activities (e.g., smoking cessation). Thus, the multiple pathways by which an HRA might ultimately lead to improved health are complex, and it is difficult to separate the impact of HRA as a stand-alone intervention. Thus, there is evidence that HRAs increase employee awareness of possible health concerns (Rula &amp; Hobgood, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001772">2010</CitationRef>), but health benefits are only evident after workers seek health advice, lifestyle counseling, or other forms of wellness support as a next step. Ethical and privacy considerations limit the breadth of HRA screening and the ability of employers to communicate directly with employees about follow-up care or counseling. Two systematic reviews of the effectiveness of worksite interventions, including health risk appraisal and feedback, have concluded no effect unless combined with broader employer efforts to provide health education and counseling (Anderson &amp; Staufacker, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00178">1996</CitationRef>; Soler et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001778">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Although workers may be provided a list of available resources to address health risk factors identified in the HRA report, results are confidential, and a worker’s decision to enroll in specific health promotion activities or lifestyle interventions is completely voluntary. However, rapidly escalating health care costs and the increasing number of chronic medical conditions among working adults are leading some employers to consider more effective methods to provide outreach to high-risk workers and encourage additional health screening and secondary prevention efforts (Loeppke et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001748">2009</CitationRef>; Nicholson, Taitel, Sweeney, Haufle, &amp; Kessler, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001757">2008</CitationRef>). Thus, there has been emerging research of the ways that workers with chronic or recurring medical problems are able to manage their symptoms at work (Anderson, Mangen, Grossmeier, Staufacker, &amp; Heinz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00175">2010</CitationRef>; de Vries, Reneman, Groothoff, Geertzen, &amp; Brouwer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001722">2012</CitationRef>), and how workers and employers might effectively communicate to overcome or accommodate health-related functional limitations without violating worker privacy concerns or creating litigation risks for employers (Shaw et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001776">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Heading>Comprehensive Worksite Health Promotion Programs</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Although HRA and feedback alone may not produce measurable health benefits, these methods can provide an important cornerstone for more large-scale comprehensive worksite wellness programs. These programs can encompass many different prevention and treatment strategies, and the large heterogeneity of wellness programs (and heterogeneity in employment settings and occupations) has posed challenges for researchers and consensus panels who have attempted to synthesize the available studies evaluating their effectiveness. Components of a comprehensive wellness program might include tobacco cessation, physical activity promotion, stress management, health screening, weight management, nutritional guidance, first aid instruction, disease management, and environmental and administrative changes in the workplace that support healthy lifestyles. Summary recommendations from a policy statement of the American Heart Association (Carnethon et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001718">2009</CitationRef>) are shown in an abbreviated form in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00174">17.4</InternalRef>. In addition to being comprehensive in scope, it is important that wellness programs be well integrated into the normal practices, values, and culture of a workplace organization and legislative and societal frameworks (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001718">Carnethon et al.</CitationRef>; Peltomäki et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001765">2008</CitationRef>). Despite these challenges, the accumulating evidence seems to support the health and productivity benefits of these more comprehensive efforts to improve employee health (Pelletier, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001764">2011</CitationRef>).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00174">

              <Para TextBreak="No">Most of the studies on multicomponent or comprehensive health promotion programs including HRA, tailored health advice and information, and worksite health seminars and workshops have been evaluated (without the benefit of a comparable control or comparison group), but their benefits can only be assessed among workers who actually take advantage of these offerings. Nevertheless, most studies have shown reductions in health risk factors (Colkesen et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001721">2011</CitationRef>; Hochart &amp; Lang, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001734">2011</CitationRef>; Loeppke et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001747">2008</CitationRef>; Mills, Kessler, Cooper, &amp; Sullivan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001754">2007</CitationRef>), absenteeism (Mills et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001754">2007</CitationRef>), presenteeism (Cancelliere, Cassidy, Ammendolia, &amp; Côté, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001717">2011</CitationRef>), health care costs (Merrill, Hyatt, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001753">2011</CitationRef>), and improvements in work performance (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001754">Mills et al.</CitationRef>). One of the best research summaries in this area is a series of periodic reviews published in the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine</Emphasis> of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of comprehensive health promotion and disease management programs (Pelletier, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001762">2005</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001763">2009</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001764">2011</CitationRef>). The most recent review in this series reported improvements in the number and quality of studies, also a fairly consistent positive effect on employee health and employer costs (Pelletier, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001764">2011</CitationRef>). A recent example is a controlled study of 266 workers completing a HRA and given access to tailored health information, wellness literature, and seminars and workshops focusing on identified health risks. There were statistically significant improvements in the reduction of health risk factors, reduced absenteeism, and improved work performance after 1 year (<CitationRef CitationID="CR001754">Mills et al.</CitationRef>). In two larger studies involving multiple employer sites, a similar comprehensive worksite wellness program showed improvements in health risk factors that were sustained for 2–5 years (Hochart &amp; Lang, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001734">2011</CitationRef>; Merrill, Anderson, &amp; Thygerson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001752">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Based on this evidence, we conclude that more comprehensive worksite promotion efforts can be effective to prevent disability and reduce health risks, especially with regard to metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. There is a current trend among comprehensive worksite health wellness programs to not only make improvements in healthy lifestyles, but to also provide more intensive support and assistance to workers with chronic diseases (Pelletier, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001764">2011</CitationRef>). Another research direction has been to develop and study worksite health promotion programs that are targeted to the needs of specific occupational settings or demographic groups; for example, construction workers (Groeneveld et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001729">2011</CitationRef>), female blue-collar workers (Campbell et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001716">2002</CitationRef>), and transportation workers (Olson, Anger, Elliot, Wipfli, &amp; Gray, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001758">2009</CitationRef>). In general, researchers have emphasized the importance of social and cultural context that can impact on the design and feasibility of health promotion programs and the variable level of acceptance across settings and locations (Peltomäki et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001765">2008</CitationRef>). In the US, health promotion programs are typically offered only among larger employers (&gt;500 employees), and these programs are over-represented among manufacturing and business/professional employers in comparison with retail, transportation, and warehousing (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001787">2000</CitationRef>). Thus, worksite wellness programs provide important health benefits to employees, but they reach only a limited percentage of the total working-age population. Unfortunately, occupations representing workers with the greatest number of cardiovascular and behavioral health risk factors [e.g., firefighters (Soteriades, Smith, Tsismenakis, Baur, &amp; Kales, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001779">2011</CitationRef>)], are among those least likely to encounter employer-sponsored health promotion programs.</Para>

              <Heading>The Business Case for Worksite Health Promotion</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Apart from knowing that worksite health promotion efforts benefit the health of workers, another important question for employers has been whether program costs are sufficiently offset by reductions in disability and health care costs or concomitant improvements in worker productivity. Other economic questions are what minimum intensity of health promotion efforts are required to show an effect, and whether there is a consistent dose–response relationship between the cost of worksite health promotion efforts and their measurable benefits. Regardless of long-term economic benefits, some employers are still unwilling to invest in employee health programs due to immediate budgetary considerations. To address these questions and to build a business case for worksite health promotion programs, researchers have included economic evaluations alongside controlled or pragmatic trials of new or experimental health promotion programs. The purpose of economic evaluations is to identify, measure, and compare costs and health consequences of two or more programs or interventions (including comparison with nominal or usual practices). In most countries, employers would bear the financial consequences of lost worker productivity and the administrative burden of rehiring and training, but other costs associated with disability and health care expense may or may not be relevant to the employer depending on national differences in health insurance and disability systems. Thus, the financial benefits to employers may be greater where there is employer-subsidized healthcare (e.g., USA), and less where healthcare costs are born by a national health service (e.g., UK).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Four types of economic evaluations should be distinguished: cost analysis; cost-effectiveness ­analysis; cost-utility analysis; and cost-benefit analysis. Cost-analysis involves systematic collection and analysis of net costs associated with a program or intervention. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is applied to compare the costs of different interventions with a common health effect. A cost-­effectiveness ratio is calculated by the difference in costs between the intervention and control intervention, divided by the difference in effects between the two interventions. CEA can be expressed as dollar value per kg weight loss. In Cost-Utility analysis (CUA), the effect of an intervention is expressed in utilities, such as Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). CUA is beneficial to compare different interventions, and/or different groups. For example, a 1.0 QALY increase by a diabetes program may cost $20,000, and a 1.0 QALY increase for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) program may cost $40,000. CUA can be expressed as the dollar value per QALY saved or gained.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In a Cost-Benefit analysis (CBA), all effects and costs are expressed in monetary values (e.g., dollars). This is a useful analysis to investigate return on investment (e.g., for each dollar spent, over a 12-month period you will receive $10 in return [because productivity costs reduce because of the intervention]). For example, in a large-scale evaluation of a comprehensive worksite wellness program among municipal employees, a $3.85 return on investment was reported over 5 years for every dollar spent (Merrill, Hyatt, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001753">2011</CitationRef>). In general, programs have achieved a return on investment from $3 to $15 for each dollar invested, with benefits offsetting costs within 12–18 months (Anderson, Serxner, &amp; Gold, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00177">2001</CitationRef>). A systematic review applying meta-analytic techniques concluded an average 28% reduction in sick leave, 26% reduction in health care costs, and 30% decrease in workers’ compensation claims costs (Aldana, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00172">2001</CitationRef>). These effect sizes can equate to considerable financial incentives for employers to invest in comprehensive wellness program.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Overall, economic evaluations of worksite wellness programs have analyzed the costs associated with worksite wellness programs in relation to the positive health benefits that they generate. In ­situations where resources are limited, economic evaluations give insight in how investments lead to effects over time. An important aspect of economic evaluations is the perspective that is used to determine which costs are included in the analyses. In the societal perspective, all relevant costs categories are included, regardless of who pays. Within the context of worksite wellness, where the employer is often the one deciding whether to invest, the employer return on investment (taking into account only those costs paid directly by the employer) are included, and an employer perspective becomes the guiding framework for comparing costs and benefits.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Worksite health promotion programs aiming at either improving diet or increasing physical activity, or a combination of both, have positive effects on workers’ health, although the cost of such programs are not trivial (van Dongen et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001789">2011</CitationRef>). It depends on the willingness of employers to pay if these programs will be implemented. A recent review showed that the research design determined the outcomes of the economic evaluation. Worksite health promotion programs aimed at improving diet and/or increasing physical activity generate financial savings in terms of reduced absenteeism costs, medical costs or both according to non-randomized trials. However, according to randomized controlled trials, they do not generate financial savings (van Dongen et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001789">2011</CitationRef>). Economic evaluations regarding smoking cessation at the workplace are sparse. Some earlier published work indicates that smoking-cessation programs that rely on counseling are cost-effective in many settings (Brown &amp; Garber, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001712">1998</CitationRef>). Some research has been conducted on the evaluation of a smoke-free policy, showing that smoke-free workplaces are more cost-effective compared to nicotine replacement therapy (Ong &amp; Glantz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001759">2005</CitationRef>). An important issue associated with economic evaluations of smoking cessation is that the benefits are particularly clear in the long term, which may exceed the working age (Warner, Smith, Smith, &amp; Fries, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001792">1996</CitationRef>). The results of economic evaluations have been very influential in persuading large employers to invest in vendor-based health promotion programs.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Apart from the potential economic benefits, implementation of large-scale employee wellness ­programs may have a less tangible but positive effect on employee life and job satisfaction, labor relations, job stress, and employee engagement (Duncan, Liechty, Miller, Chinoy, &amp; Ricciardi, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001725">2011</CitationRef>; Grossmeier, Terry, Cipriotti, &amp; Burtaine, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001730">2010</CitationRef>; Jasperson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001737">2010</CitationRef>; Kimathi, Gregoire, Dowling, &amp; Stone, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001739">2009</CitationRef>; Merrill, Anderson, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001752">2011</CitationRef>; Schulte &amp; Vainio, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001773">2010</CitationRef>; Tveito &amp; Eriksen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001786">2009</CitationRef>). Employers hoping to attract new talent in a competitive marketplace may invest more heavily in workplace health and wellness programs because positive health messages and healthy lifestyle benefits are enticing for young workers. Among existing workers, additional offerings in worksite health ­programs may improve overall perceptions of the company, engender a greater sense of trust and commitment, and improve retention. The positive financial impact to employers for maintaining strong labor relations has been well documented (Huselid, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001735">1995</CitationRef>), and this remains an important incentive for businesses to increase their investment in employee health and wellness programs.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">One inherent source of tension that deserves mention is the potential conflict that an employer faces while trying to promote workforce health, on the one hand, and driving productivity, on the other. Thus, development of a worksite wellness program may require that employers revisit some of their existing policies regarding working hours, pay structure, productivity demands, working hours, shift work requirements, and overtime hours. Although healthy workers are likely to be more productive in the long run, employer support for a new wellness program might be undermined if high production demands are perceived as having negative health consequences. This may explain why some wellness programs have shown improved employee health and life satisfaction, but a concurrent decrease in job satisfaction (Merrill, Anderson, et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001752">2011</CitationRef>). The effectiveness of a comprehensive worksite wellness program, then, depends on the readiness of the organization, including compatibility with existing policies and procedures, and adequate labor relations. If workers perceive that employer support for health and wellness is not genuine, then a wellness program is not likely to generate a high level of participation or engagement. A number of authors have commented on the need to assess organizational readiness as a first step in launching a comprehensive wellness program (Grossmeier et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001730">2010</CitationRef>; Renaud et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001770">2008</CitationRef>; Seymour &amp; Dupré, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001775">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Heading>Integration of Health and Wellness Promotion in the Workplace</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Although research into worksite wellness programs has, by necessity, required evaluation of discrete elements and procedures that can be easily replicated, one universal observation from this research is that changing lifestyle habits and reducing health risks among workers can require a substantial shift in the organizational culture of the workplace, and this can only be accomplished with considerable management support, employee outreach, and benevolent persistence (Renaud et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001770">2008</CitationRef>; McLellan et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001751">2009</CitationRef>; Seymour &amp; Dupré, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001775">2008</CitationRef>). Another observation is that considerable fragmentation of health and safety processes exist in the workplace: a safety professional provides training to reduce workplace hazards; a disability case manager coordinates return-to-work; an employee assistance program provides stress management and crisis intervention; a health care insurer coordinates disease management efforts; physicians direct medical care; an on-site nurse provides first aid; supervisors deal with work and family conflict, and so on. These “silos” of separate vendors, consultants, and individuals can make it difficult to communicate positive and uniform health messages in the workplace, and substantial efforts are needed to maintain consistent wide-scale health directives within the organization.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">To address this problem, there is an emerging view in occupational health and safety that these programs should be more fully integrated to uniformly attend to issues of disease and injury prevention, health promotion, stress reduction, symptom management, and accommodations to age, family, and life stage (Cherniack et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001796">2011</CitationRef>). Many industrialized nations are experiencing a significant aging of the workforce with a greater number of chronic health conditions, and this has led some employers to embrace a more expanded view of workplace wellness beyond conventional safety and disability management practices. This new perspective suggests a greater interest in functional performance at work (not just absenteeism), a broader view of economic consequences (e.g., including medical costs), a prevention focus, and a concern for fitness and overall well-being, not just disease or injury. This integrated occupational wellness paradigm focuses attention on worker attitudes, job characteristics, and coping strategies in addition to biomedical diagnoses and functional capacities. This paradigm also suggests that some corporate reorganization may be necessary to unite health-related activities under fewer departmental divisions.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The real advantage of an integrated wellness approach is the ability to communicate a consistent message to employees about the high priority placed on employee health and safety. Though wellness efforts of the company may be housed in a number of separate departments, workers have a more singular view of the organization’s overall commitment to their health and safety (Ribisl &amp; Rieschl, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001771">1993</CitationRef>). Thus, there should be an overall set of corporate values guiding policies and practices around wellness whether it pertains to promoting healthy lifestyles, responding to workplace safety concerns, or helping workers manage chronic disorders. This is not easy to achieve when health-related practices are governed by different sets of legislative rules, insurance and healthcare systems, and financial considerations. Nevertheless, the concept of integrated wellness serves as an important guiding framework for the development of effective worksite health and wellness promotion programs.</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusions and Future Directions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Overall, there is growing evidence that worksite wellness programs can improve the health of workers with positive economic returns to employers. Worksite health and wellness promotion can be comprised of specific programs and services, employer policies and procedures, financial benefits and incentives, and changes in workplace culture or environment. Specific programs focusing on smoking cessation, weight reduction, or health risk appraisal have shown a moderate level of success and economic benefit, but the greatest impact has been for comprehensive wellness programs that include multiple initiatives, involve environmental and cultural changes in the workplace, and are tailored to meet the unique circumstances of organizations, employee health concerns, and work settings.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">One emerging issue in the design of worksite wellness programs is the need to include ­environmental modifications and changes in employer policies and practices along with employee health risk appraisal, health education, and health behavior change programs. Thus, a comprehensive wellness program is more effective when employees perceive that the employer is not only sponsoring new health promotion programs but also reassessing the work environment and organizational culture in an effort to promote health and wellness. Another emerging issue in worksite health and wellness promotion is a need to better integrate health promotion efforts across different health and safety divisions within the organization. Otherwise, employees can receive confusing or mixed messages regarding the company’s commitment to employee health and well-being. Also, worksite health promotion efforts may be ineffective in the presence of extreme production demands, lack of attention to basic safety concerns, poor labor relations, or failure to provide normative health and disability benefits.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Though worksite wellness is a relative newcomer to the professional field of occupational health and safety, there is mounting evidence that employers have a significant opportunity and economic incentive to improve employee health through comprehensive wellness programs. Such programs, however, are still uncommon among smaller employers and in many occupational settings, so the potential population-wide impact of these programs on public health has not been realized. Many questions remain unanswered about the specific elements of wellness programs that are most effective, but the current evidence suggests that a comprehensive program that reaches a larger number of employees will provide the greatest impact. In countries with an aging workforce and a growing ­number of chronic health conditions (e.g., USA), health and wellness promotion efforts within the workplace is likely to become more commonplace and more expansive in the coming years.</Para>
