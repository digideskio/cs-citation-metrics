          <Para>The purpose of this chapter is to present a summary of recent research of integrated weed management (IWM) practices appropriate to cool season row crops capable of producing closed canopies before they are harvestedâ€”carrot (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Daucus carota</Emphasis> L.), cabbage (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Brassica oleracea</Emphasis> L.), and red/fodder and sugar beet (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Beta vulgaris</Emphasis> L.). First, the critical period of each crop will be defined; these crops produce a canopy that is initially slow to develop, but later in the season will attenuate enough light to suppress further weed emergence. Next, various physical, cultural, and chemical measures to control weeds during that critical period of these crops will be examined. Finally, for each IWM practice, the logic for their use, how they may be implemented, the weed management benefits and limitations of each practice, and what is known of the effect of each practice on the indicators of agroecosystem health will be summarized.</Para>

              <Primary>Integrated weed management (IWM)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is defined here as the use of more than one broad category of weed control tactics (i.e., biological, chemical, cultural, and physical) to allow producers to: (1) minimize crop losses due to competition, allelopathy, and interference with crop management and harvest; (2) reduce production and survival of weed seeds and vegetative propagules; (3) prevent introduction of new problem species [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]; and (4) realize long-term gains in certain indicators of agroecosystem health (i.e., energy efficiency, water quality, and soil quality) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. Inherent in the design of IWM systems then should be the curtailing of weed outbreaks and the enhancement of the integrity of the agroecosystem. Though much of the research focus of weed science<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Weed science</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> continues to be on the most effective use of chemical control<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Chemical control</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> measures in field crops [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>], the literature contains many attempts to integrate two or three different weed control tactics that can be practicably applied in vegetable production systems.</Para>
          <Para>Despite the efforts to develop IWM systems, there are only specific cases where growers are extensively implementing them [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>], such as for the management of glyphosate-resistant annual ryegrass (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Lolium rigidum</Emphasis> Gaud.) in Australia. System models used to evaluate cropping systems based on IWM proposed that this is partially a result of grower perception that the cost to benefit ratio of applying multiple techniques is greater than reliance upon herbicides alone [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. Closer analysis reveals that this perception is only true on a case-by-case basis. Two contrasting examples illustrate this: (1) In the northeastern USA, the conventional weed control method relative to IWM systems provided greater yield and net economic returns of corn and soybean [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>] and (2) in the United Kingdom, spring cereals grown in a production system using IWM provided similar net return to that of spring cereals under conventional management [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. Unfavorable grower perception of the economics of IWM systems is a key reason why they are not widely adopted. Weed scientistsâ€™ success in facilitating adoption of IWM practices by producers can be improved by demonstrating the net economic effect of IWM measures.</Para>
          <Para>In instances when economics favor the use of IWM over conventional weed control, the increased management complexity inherent in the application of IWM is still a challenge that must be met [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. Producers have myriad concerns beyond managing weeds; when one examines the weed management techniques of growers with similar crops in different parts of the world, the use and effect of each technique must be considered in the context of the environmental conditions and production system [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. One set of IWM practices cannot be prescribed in all situations and cropping systems, but rather there are several different techniques that must be considered for their potential to fit an existing production system. The selection and implementation of those practices in a manner that is both feasible economically and supports the primary objective of IWM is vital for producers to successfully adopt these systems [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>].</Para>

          <Heading>Critical Period of Weed Control</Heading>
          <Para>The IWM system described for carrot, cole crops, and beets relies upon their ability to produce a canopy<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Canopy</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> that will suppress weeds that would emerge from mid-season onward. The key cultural aspect of this system is the application of weed control techniques to prevent interference with these crops during their critical period of weed control. The critical weed control period is the interval in the lifecycle of the crop when it must be kept weed-free to prevent yield loss [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. The critical period concept can be a useful tool for timing different weed control options; however, there are several factors that must be considered for their successful use. The beginning and duration of the critical period vary depending on rates of growth, morphology, height, and leaf area development of each crop [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. Furthermore, cultural practices such as seeding date [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>] and planting method (e.g., transplanting vs. direct seeding), which influence early growth rate and size relative to weeds, all significantly impact the critical period. Finally, crop response to variation in available moisture influence cropâ€“weed interference is also an important determinant of the onset of the critical period of weed control [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>].</Para>
          <Para>The critical periods of weed control for carrot, cabbage, sugar beet, and red beet vary and are impacted by cultural management and environment. Since soil temperature, moisture, and planting date cause the actual dates of the critical weed-free period to vary substantially, the critical period in sugar beet is best delineated by crop growth stages and occurs from the four-leaf stage to canopy closure [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. Similar to sugar beet, the maximum duration that carrots must be free of weeds, without compromising yield, is based upon leaf stage and is from emergence until the 12-leaf stage of crop growth [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. Planting date influenced the critical period in carrot, such that delayed planting from late April to late May in southern Ontario reduced the length of the critical period to emergence until the four-leaf stage of crop [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. Critical periods in cabbage and red beet have not been determined on the basis of leaf stages, but rather on time after crop emergence, and vary annually depending on the availability of moisture. For example, the critical period in direct-seeded cabbage began 2 or 4 weeks after emergence, depending on available moisture [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. The critical period of weed control in transplanted cabbage was consistently from emergence to 3 weeks after transplanting [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. This consistency from year to year reflects the greater competitiveness and uniform growth of plants grown from transplants relative to seeded crops [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>]. The critical period of red beet was also determined based on time from crop emergence. KavaliauskaitÄ— and Â­Bobinas showed that red beet yield was not reduced as long as it was kept weed-free for the first 4 weeks after emergence [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>].</Para>

              <Primary>Physical control</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> during the critical period is a key component of IWM for cool season vegetable crops such as carrot, red beet, cabbage, and sugar beet. These crops produce a canopy that is slow to develop, and are planted at between row spacings<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Row spacing</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> of 30 and 70Â cm, with much smaller spacings within the rows. As a result, control of weeds between the rows is much easier than controlling weeds inside rows. Â­Whole-crop physical weed control is done by implements such as harrows and flame weeders; interrow weed removal with cultivators; and intrarow methods, such as is done with torsion or finger weeders, may be utilized to control weeds during the critical period. Each of these three types of physical weed control is appropriate to use during different times of the critical period; therefore, each will be separately discussed. Harrowing and flame weeding are most appropriate for use prior to crop emergence, while inter- and intrarow cultivation possess the selectivity to be safely used during early stages of crop development<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Physical control</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>.</Para>
          <Para>Harrowing and flame weeding prior to the emergence of cool season vegetable crops requires the crop to be sown deeper than from where weeds emerge, and are only effective on very small weeds. Harrowing is most effective on weeds from white thread to cotyledon stage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>], while flame weeding<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Weeding</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> consistently caused a 90Â % reduction in biomass of various weed species with between 5 and 11 leaves [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>]. It is important to note that propane dosage is a significant determinant of the efficacy of flame weedingâ€”a 76-kgÂ ha<Superscript>âˆ’1</Superscript> dose of propane was required to obtain this level of control [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>]. Also, grass weed species are generally less sensitive to flaming [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>â€“<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>]. A convenient and cost-effective method of nonchemical control is to use harrows to control very small weeds in these small-seeded vegetable crops before crop emergence [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]. Flame weeding can also be used to kill early emerging weeds prior to crop emergence, though the available time when this can be safely applied is limited in faster emerging crops such as cabbage, which may germinate before many weeds [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>]<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Physical control</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>.</Para>
          <Para>The use of flaming to destroy weeds without disturbing the soil may be done prior to or immediately following the planting of slower emerging crops like carrot to form a stale seedbed [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>]. Since this technique avoids soil disturbance, it minimizes weed emergence after the stale seedbed<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Stale seedbed</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is formed [<CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>]. Caldwell and Mohler compared weed density and biomass of a number of annual weed species in stale seedbeds formed with single or multiple applications of glyphosate, propane flaming<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Flaming</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, a spring tine weeder, a springtooth harrow, or a rotary tiller at approximately 4 weeks after an initial tillage operation and just prior to planting [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>]. A single flaming or glyphosate application caused similar reductions in density and biomass of annual broadleaf weeds, and both were more effective than the spring tine weeder, springtooth harrow, and rotary tiller. None of the stale seedbed techniques provided season-long control of annual broadleaf weeds and none were effective against creeping perennial species such as yellow nutsedge (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Cyperus esculentus</Emphasis> L.) but could be integrated with in-crop weed control techniques to improve control and reduce the need for herbicides [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>].</Para>
          <Para>One of the drawbacks of forming a stale seedbed prior to planting is that the weed emergence in the planting rows is significantly greater than between them [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>]. Modifications to planting techniques could further improve the effectiveness of stale seedbeds if they reduced the stimulation of weed germination in planting rows and subsequently reduced intrarow weeds [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>]. A technique called punch planting shows utility in stale seedbed<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Stale seedbed</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> preparation, as it creates holes in the ground while minimizing soil disturbance outside the holes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>]. Punch planting is typically done using a dibber drill, which consists of wheels that run along the soil surface and several radially mounted plungers through which air is blown that pushes the plunger and seed into the soil [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>]. Rasmussen examined the interaction between planting type (drilling vs. punch planting) and punch planting date after the formation of stale seedbeds by propane flaming on intrarow weed emergence in fodder beet [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>]. Flaming reduced intrarow weed density by 30Â % more in punch planting treatments than in drilled treatments across all planting times<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Planting time</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Rasmussen also demonstrated that weed emergence in fodder beet was influenced by the length of time by which planting and flaming were delayed, such that waiting 2 and 4 weeks to plant and flame reduced emergence by 55 and 79Â %, respectively [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>]. Punch planting can reduce intrarow density, but its effectiveness is influenced by planting time in slower emerging crops such as fodder beet.</Para>
          <Para>Similar experiments to those conducted by Rasmussen [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>] were conducted on sugar beet and carrot [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>]. In one experiment, intrarow weed emergence in stale seedbeds after flaming was compared between drilled and punch-planted treatments at five different planting dates. Punch planting alone did not reduce the average intrarow weed density in sugar beet. Across all planting dates, the effect of flaming<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Flaming</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> and punch planting on intrarow weed density varied from 31 to 60Â % in different years, depending on weed emergence<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Weed emergence</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> patterns prior to flaming. Flaming reduced intrarow weed emergence by 89Â % when planting was delayed to 4 weeks after seedbed preparation, compared to timely planting [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>]. A second set of experiments in spring- and fall-seeded carrot compared drilling to punch planting, where flaming was used to kill weeds in the stale seedbed. Delayed planting did not affect weed emergence in any treatments in carrot. Punch planting and flame weeding did not reduce weed emergence in spring-seeded carrot, but they did reduce weed emergence by 52Â % in fall-seeded carrot. Crop tolerance also varied between sugar beet and carrotâ€”though carrot density was similar in all treatments, sugar beet density was reduced in punch planting treatments compared to drilling [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>]. This may have been influenced by flaming treatments delayed by rainfall at certain planting dates, though Rasmussen etÂ al. attributed some of the reduction in sugar beet emergence to the punch planter itself [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>].</Para>
          <Para>Harrowing and flaming are unsuitable for the management of weeds <Emphasis Type="Italic">after</Emphasis> crop has emerged but before the critical period of weed control has passed. Roots of carrot, direct-seeded cabbage, red beet, and sugar beet plants up to the four-leaf stage possess less resistance to uprooting [<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>] than is required to bury and/or remove certain early-germinating annual weed species enough to control them [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>]. Even reducing moving speeds and setting harrow tines to shallow, less aggressive settings to minimize crop injury is not enough to adequately control weed seedlings [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]. Generally, broadleaf crops lack sufficient tolerance<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Tolerance</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> to avoid membrane disruption caused by the temperature levels experienced by plants during flaming [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>]. This lack of selectivity during the early part of the critical period of these crops requires that measures other than harrowing or flaming be implemented to control these weeds soon after crop emergence.</Para>
          <Para>Mechanical interrow cultivation is regularly conducted in carrot, cabbage, red beet, and sugar beet in organic and conventional production systems [<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>]. Various configurations of flexible tines (Fig.Â <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">11.1a</InternalRef>) and rolling baskets (Fig.Â <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">11.1b</InternalRef>) may be used with these crop species, with consideration of the between-row spacing needed, which will be fitted with different discs, plates, or hoods to protect the crop [<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef>]. Steerage hoes must be used to ensure selective control of weeds using interrow cultivators, which is most commonly done by manual steering [<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>]. Electronic guidance systems were envisioned to be an important development to minimize crop damage when driving tillage<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Tillage</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> implements along crop rows in crops such as carrot, cabbage, red beet, and sugar beet [<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">39</CitationRef>]. New machine vision guidance systems are being evaluated that utilize morphology, spectral characteristics, and visual texture to differentiate weeds from crops at positional errors of less than 30Â mm for working speeds of 5â€“6Â kmÂ hr<Superscript>âˆ’1</Superscript> [<CitationRef CitationID="CR40">40</CitationRef>].

          <Para>Computer vision technology is of even greater interest for use in intrarow cultivation, which, due to poor selectivity, is more difficult than interrow cultivation. Torsion, finger, and brush weeders were specifically developed for intrarow cultivation in high-value crops [<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>]. Torsion weeders have pairs of tines that are set on either side of crop rows; these provided the greatest level of cost-effectiveness for weed control compared with finger and brush weeders in sugar beet, carrot, and red beet [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>], as well as in transplanted cabbage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>]. Steering control is crucial for the selectivity of these weeders, and research attempts to develop automated control is ongoing [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>]. Row guidance, vision discrimination among plant species, within-row weed removal cutting implements, and global positioning systems to increase steering control are key components of this technology.</Para>
          <Para>The ability to visually discriminate a weed from a crop plant remains the greatest challenge to adoption of existing technology for intrarow weed control in cool season vegetable crops. In situations where weeds occupy a significant proportion of the crop rows, machine-guided sensors are unable to distinguish between crop and plants [<CitationRef CitationID="CR40">40</CitationRef>]. Mapping techniques that utilize real-time kinetic-global positioning systems (RTK-GPS) may eventually provide enough information about the position of individual crop plants to steer cultivator equipment with an acceptable level of selectivity for intrarow cultivation of cool season vegetable crops during the early part of the critical period of weed control [<CitationRef CitationID="CR42">42</CitationRef>]. Rasmussen etÂ al. contrasted the accuracy of a rotor tine cultivator, or cycloid hoe, with and without crop plant RTK-GPS to move it around crop plants in the rows, and a flex tine harrow at the two- to four-leaf stage of sugar beet and carrot [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>]. Rasmussen etÂ al. also varied the crop establishment procedure using a normal planting drill and the punch planter described earlier on a stale seedbed prepared by flaming [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>]. As was observed in a previous study [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>], punch planting and flaming reduced crop emergence of sugar beet but not of carrot [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>]. Interestingly, the cycloid hoe with RTK-GPS showed the same level of selectivity as the cycloid hoe without RTK-GPS and flex tine harrow. When averaged across the three treatments, intrarow weed control was 70 and 47Â % in 2008 and 2009, respectively [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>]. All three treatments caused a 20Â % decrease in crop density<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Crop density</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> compared to the untreated check, which was similar in both years. Further research on parameters that affect the accuracy of RTK-GPS, as well as the types of intrarow tillage implements, is needed to ensure crop safety in cool season vegetable crops, as producers would not accept this level of crop damage.</Para>
          <Para>Early planting, tillage, and pesticide applications in cool season vegetable crops can increase soil compaction when these occur in cool, wet soils [<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef>]. In addition, intensive tillage can reduce soil organic matter and damage soil structure such as is done for processing crops that are typically grown according to a strict production schedule. A potential avenue that the producers of these crops may use to offset these negative effects is to use modified reduced tillage systems to reduce the actual width of a field that is tilled in order to increase surface residues [<CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>]. While cabbage showed yield reductions in no-till treatments due to poor establishment and cool soil temperatures, strip tilling a 20â€“30-cm-wide band of soil overcame these problems and resulted in yields similar to conventionally tilled cabbage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>]. Mochizuki etÂ al. examined the interaction between the band tilled and tillage<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Tillage</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> depth [<CitationRef CitationID="CR45">45</CitationRef>]. They showed that despite a 1Â â„ƒ increase in soil temperature, increasing tillage width from 15 to 30Â cm did not affect cabbage growth yield. Furthermore, growth and yield of cabbage were greatly improvedâ€”possibly due to decreased soil penetration resistanceâ€”by increasing tillage depth from 10 to 30Â cm in the 15-cm-wide tilled zones, which still left between 60 and 80Â % of the soil surface area undisturbed [<CitationRef CitationID="CR45">45</CitationRef>]. Weed control between the tilled zones of adjacent rows was done chemically, indicating that strip tillage must be integrated with other weed control techniques.</Para>
          <Para>The presence of an oat (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Avena sativa</Emphasis> L.) cover crop in between tilled strips may augment herbicide use to suppress weeds between cabbage rows. The 25-cm-wide strips of preestablished oat are killed using a strip tiller, and cabbage is planted into the strips. The oats must then be killed with a herbicide at some time after transplanting; oat control timing is an important consideration in this type of strip-tillage system [<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">46</CitationRef>]. Oat reduced cabbage yield when oat control was delayed by 9 days after transplanting (DAT). An additional benefit of oat strips is an increase in certain beneficial arthropods that are natural enemies of key cabbage pests, such as imported cabbage worm (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Pieris rapae</Emphasis> L.), diamondback moth (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Plutella xylostella</Emphasis> L.), and cabbage loopers (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Trichoplusia ni</Emphasis> HÃ¼bner) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">46</CitationRef>]. The authors concluded that the presence of the oat mulch enhanced habitat complexity enough to encourage the abundance of natural enemies to these pests.</Para>

            </IndexTerm> systems for carrot production have been madeâ€”unfortunately, reduced tillage across the entire bed interferes with stand establishment in carrot as it does for other vegetable crops [<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">47</CitationRef>]. Strip tillage has shown to have potential in carrot; however, the prevalence of perennial and winter annual weed species increased in strip tillage systems [<CitationRef CitationID="CR48">48</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR49">49</CitationRef>]. When combined with compost applications, strip tillage may be used to provide acceptable weed control [<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>] and may also increase soil organic matter. A second option for control of weeds between rows in strip-tilled cool season vegetable crops includes living mulches grown in strips between crop rows [<CitationRef CitationID="CR49">49</CitationRef>].</Para>

            </IndexTerm>.</Para>
          <Para>The inclusion of competitive cereal crops, such as barley (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Hordeum vulgare</Emphasis> L.), in rotations with vegetable crops such as carrot, have been shown to reduce weed populations and increase crop yields in some instances. Leroux etÂ al. showed that seedling recruitment and biomass of nodding beggar-ticks (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Bidens cernun</Emphasis> L.) and Canada fleabane (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Erigeron canadensis</Emphasis> L.) were decreased the most when barley preceded a carrot crop [<CitationRef CitationID="CR53">53</CitationRef>]. In addition, the authors noted a significant reduction in root-knot nematode (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Meloidogyne hapla</Emphasis> Chitwood) injury in those rotations that included barley, which was attributed to a reduction in weeds that traditionally function as root-knot nematode hosts [<CitationRef CitationID="CR55">55</CitationRef>]. The combination of reduced competition and a reduction in root-knot nematode corresponded to a 35â€“50Â % increase in carrot yield. The effect of competitive crops, such as spring cereals, may be used to reduce weed populations in subsequently grown cool season vegetable crops<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm>.</Para>
          <Para>Research has also shown that incorporating a regularly mowed legume cover crop into rotation with cabbage can be a more effective means of managing future weed and other pest populations than a grass cover crop. Bellinder etÂ al. showed that 2 years of frequently mowed alfalfa (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Medicago sativa</Emphasis> L.) and red clover grown prior to cabbage had the similar effect on weed seedbank density as tillage<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Tillage</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> and a herbicide treatment in sweet corn grown before cabbage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR56">56</CitationRef>]. The allelopathic and competitive effect that grass cover crops, such as cereal rye, have on weed seedbanks [<CitationRef CitationID="CR57">57</CitationRef>] may not be as great as that of mowed alfalfa or red clover. Frequent mowing of legume cover crops may have reduced flowering and seed set, competed with weeds for available resources, and, in the absence of tillage, concentrated weed seeds on soil surface, which increases the risk of decay and predation than seed buried by tillage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR58">58</CitationRef>]. Bellinder etÂ al. measured an increase in common ragweed (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Ambrosia artemisiifolia</Emphasis> L.) seed density after the cereal rye cover crop rotation only [<CitationRef CitationID="CR56">56</CitationRef>]. Average cabbage head size and yield were related negatively to density of common ragweed [<CitationRef CitationID="CR59">59</CitationRef>]. Not only is this increase in common ragweed seed density important from the standpoint of increased competition from weeds but also because common ragweed has been associated with increased incidence of white mold in cabbage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR60">60</CitationRef>]<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm>.</Para>
          <Para>Attempts have been made to overcome the effect of competition from interseeded cover crops in cool season vegetables such as cabbage. The presence of interseeded cover crops during the critical period of weed control reduced cabbage yield due to light interference [<CitationRef CitationID="CR61">61</CitationRef>], so delayed seeding of the cover crop was hypothesized to be a means of suppressing weeds after the critical period, without compromising crop yield. This requires that some other weed control measure, either chemical or physical, be employed during the critical period. Brainard etÂ al. examined the effect of hairy vetch (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Vicia villosa</Emphasis> Roth.), lana vetch (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Vicia villosa</Emphasis> Roth ssp. <Emphasis Type="Italic">varia</Emphasis>), or oat overseeded at 10, 20, or 30 DAT [<CitationRef CitationID="CR62">62</CitationRef>]. A flex tine weeder and an S-tine cultivator were used to control weeds at 10, 10Â +Â 20, or 10Â +Â 20Â +Â 30 DAT with or without cover crops sown at the time of the last cultivation. Cabbage yield was reduced when cover crops were interseeded at the earliest planting date, but either vetch species could be sown 20 or 30 DAT without reducing cabbage yield [<CitationRef CitationID="CR62">62</CitationRef>]. Weed control and cabbage yield were not different in the interseeded treatments than in those treatments that were cultivated in the absence of cover crops. As a result, the economics of overseeding cover crops from the perspective of weed control alone does not initially appear favorable because of costs associated with hairy vetch seed and management. Opportunities to utilize hairy vetch in cabbage grown in rotation with other high-value vegetable crops, such as tomato (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Solanum lycopersicum</Emphasis> L.), do exist. Sainju etÂ al. estimated similar fruit yield, biomass, and N uptake in tomato grown after a fall cover crop of hairy vetch to tomato grown on bare ground and fertilized with 180Â kgÂ NÂ ha<Superscript>âˆ’1</Superscript> [<CitationRef CitationID="CR63">63</CitationRef>]. In addition to replacing fertilizer requirements, hairy vetch mulch suppresses many annual weeds, increases infiltration, and reduces runoff and sediment losses from fields [<CitationRef CitationID="CR64">64</CitationRef>]. The potential for improving soil fertility and structure may justify the extra cost and management associated with overseeding hairy vetch at 20 DAT in cabbage production systems that include high-value crops well suited to such a rotation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm>.</Para>
          <Para>In some cases, the effect of crop rotation on weed populations in cool season vegetable crops is due to crop management, rather than competition from rotational crops alone. For example, Ball and Miller reported that the density of kochia (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Kochia scoparia</Emphasis> [L.] Schrad.) in sugar beet was more strongly influenced by tillage<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Tillage</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> type (moldboard vs. chisel plowing) and herbicide rate than by rotational crop (corn vs. pinto beans) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR65">65</CitationRef>]. The importance of herbicide efficacy on future weed populations in rotations that include cool season crops like sugar beet was well illustrated by BÃ rberi etÂ al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR66">66</CitationRef>]. The results showed that in low-herbicide-input systems, weed flora was more diversified 1 year after a less competitive crop like sugar beet. In high-herbicide-input systems, however, weed species diversity was a function of the selectivity of the herbicides used. Long-term research that evaluated the effects of several management practices over two rotational cycles, including rotational crop, herbicide program, tillage, inclusion of winter wheat, or inclusion of a red clover cover crop has also shown that rotational crop had much less effect than management practices on weed densities of summer annual weeds<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Annual weeds</Primary>
              <Secondary>summer</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm> in transplanted cabbage. Brainard etÂ al. found that rotations that included 3-year continuous field corn before cabbage did not produce greater summer annual weed densities than rotations that included winter wheat before cabbage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR54">54</CitationRef>]. Rather, the herbicide program used in cabbage significantly reduced summer annual seed production and spring tillage prevented winter annual survival and seed production. Including red clover had different effects depending on the rotation in which it was used [<CitationRef CitationID="CR54">54</CitationRef>]. When cabbage followed continuous field corn, red clover increased summer annual weed seed production or emergence; however, when red clover was used in a rotation that included sweet corn, peas, wheat, and cabbage, there was a 96Â % reduction in seedbank density of winter annuals in the first, but not the second, cycle of the rotation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR54">54</CitationRef>]. Crop rotation, tillage, and herbicide use in each year of a rotation exert a strong effect on weed populations, and thus may be a useful means of seedbank manipulation in cool season vegetable crop rotations<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Para>Row spacing may be used in cool season vegetable crops to increase sugar beet competitiveness with weeds and combined with herbicide application timing can impact weed control and crop yield. Armstrong and Sprague examined the effect of sugar beet planted in 38-, 51-, and 76-cm rows and herbicide applications to weeds of 5-, 10-, and 15-cm height on weed density and biomass, and sugar beet yield [<CitationRef CitationID="CR67">67</CitationRef>]. Weed density and biomass were less in 38- and 51-cm rows compared with 76-cm rows, as long as glyphosate was applied to weeds that were 10Â cm in height or less. Furthermore, when averaged over row width, sugar beet root yields were reduced when glyphosate application was delayed until weeds were 15Â cm in height. Sugar beet root and sugar yields were greater when planted in 38- and 51-cm rows than in 76-cm rows [<CitationRef CitationID="CR67">67</CitationRef>]. Sugar beet planted in narrow rows suppressed late-season weed growth more than when planted in wider rows. In this study, early season weeds were controlled with an initial application of glyphosate<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm> development and competitiveness. Water is transferred from soil aggregates to seed by direct contact; however, when aggregates are larger, seed-to-soil contact is reduced, which may delay crop germination and emergence [<CitationRef CitationID="CR70">70</CitationRef>]. Soil aggregates are larger in chisel-plowed than moldboard-plowed soil [<CitationRef CitationID="CR71">71</CitationRef>], which delayed sugar beet emergence in chisel-plowed treatments [<CitationRef CitationID="CR72">72</CitationRef>]. Furthermore, chisel and moldboard plowing affected weed and sugar beet response to preemergence (PRE) herbicides. Though PRE herbicides caused more visible injury to sugar beet in the chisel-plowed treatments, herbicide treatment had no effect on sugar beet plant stand, canopy<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Canopy</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> closure, or final yield. Moldboard plowing did result in earlier sugar beet canopy closure and greater recoverable white sugar yield [<CitationRef CitationID="CR72">72</CitationRef>]. The inclusion of PRE herbicides with tillage increased control of common annual weed species, including common lambâ€™s quarter (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Chenopodium album</Emphasis> L.), pigweed species (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Amaranthus</Emphasis> spp.), velvetleaf (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Abutilon theophrasti</Emphasis> Medik.), and giant foxtail (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Setaria faberi</Emphasis> Herrm.) compared to where tillage was used without a herbicide. The delay in crop emergence and canopy development caused by chisel plowing corresponds to a relative reduction in crop competitiveness compared with the moldboard-plowed system. Bollman and Sprague therefore recommended that sugar beet be grown in narrower rows when using chisel plowing [<CitationRef CitationID="CR72">72</CitationRef>].</Para>
          <Para>Herbicide application can interact with tillage system (moldboard and chisel plowing and rotary tilling) and rotations that include continuous cotton or sugar beet grown after cotton. Vasileaiadis etÂ al. showed that sugar beet yield was greatest in moldboard plowing treatments where PRE herbicides were used, and that the combination of herbicides and interrow cultivation used in the cotton cycle of the rotation reduced total weed density in the following sugar beet crop [<CitationRef CitationID="CR73">73</CitationRef>]. It should be noted that while density of important broadleaf weedsâ€”redroot pigweed (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Amaranthus retroflexus</Emphasis> L.) and black nightshade (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Solanum nigrum</Emphasis> L.)â€”was lower in the herbicide-treated plots, barnyard grass (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Echinochloa crus-galli</Emphasis> [L.] Beauv.) density was higher, as the herbicides applied in sugar beet had little efficacy on this species. Black nightshade density was lower in the second year of the continuous cotton rotation than in the cottonâ€“sugar beet rotation. Vasileaiadis etÂ al. observed that most of the black nightshade emerged before cotton planting and was therefore killed during preparation of the cotton seedbed [<CitationRef CitationID="CR73">73</CitationRef>]. However, because sugar beet is planted much earlier than cotton, black nightshade emerged after sugar beet was planted but before the crop was able to develop a weed-suppressive canopy<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
          <Para>The findings made in the references cited here are of practical relevance to the development of IWM plans by producers, agronomists, and crop scouts to maintain weed populations at economically acceptable densities in cool season vegetable crops. The various measures that have been described detail several key decision points, including crop rotation, planting date, tillage selection, secondary and tertiary tillage, cover crops, planting density, row spacing<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Row spacing</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, and herbicide use. While of practical use, this information can also be a resource to guide further research, whether it is to examine the possibility of adapting already currently developed systems to different regions where these crops are grown or to combine different aspects of different IWM systems. There are several areas of research on IWM in cool season vegetable crops that will improve our understanding of how weeds respond to novel management practices or new combinations of existing practices and how that response impacts the relationships between crops and weeds. Research on the effect of IWM practices on the soil environment and other biota is also needed to assess their potential impact on agroecosystem integrity [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>].</Para>
          <Para>One area of research that lacks focus is matching the very specific spectra of weeds different herbicides control to compliment specific weaknesses of the different tillage, crop rotation, cover crop, and other nonchemical methods detailed above. In a previous example, for instance, barnyard grass and black nightshade escapes could be managed with PRE applications of <Emphasis Type="Italic">S</Emphasis>-metolachlor in sugar beet [<CitationRef CitationID="CR74">74</CitationRef>], cabbage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR75">75</CitationRef>], or red beet and carrot [<CitationRef CitationID="CR76">76</CitationRef>]. It is equally important to understand that a PRE herbicide like <Emphasis Type="Italic">S</Emphasis>-metolachlor would be much less effective in a minimum-tillage system because surface residues would intercept much of the herbicide and thus reduce its efficacy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR77">77</CitationRef>]. This level of detail could help to improve the consistency of control of IWM strategies, particularly for weeds whose germination patterns, growth rate and habit, and adaptations to low levels of light, water, and nutrients allow them to escape nonchemical control treatments. This approach might seem to be in conflict with ecological weed management [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. Alternatively, it could bridge the gap between chemically intensive weed control and cultural weed management by providing a starting point for encouraging growers who rely almost exclusively on herbicides for the control of weeds to begin integrating nonchemical control measures. More thoughtful inclusion of herbicides, based upon the weeds they control, into the development of IWM systems could therefore be one way of working with growers to increase the uptake of those systems.</Para>
          <Para>In certain parts of the world (for example, in many parts of Europe), pesticide legislation and herbicide resistance have placed pressure on scientists to develop IWM systems that incorporate fewer pesticides [<CitationRef CitationID="CR78">78</CitationRef>] and increased tillage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR79">79</CitationRef>]. Though these limitations are not so thoroughly felt in other parts of the world, weed management in organic production systems faces a similar challenge regardless of political and social environments. Conventional tillage practices for cover crop management, seedbed establishment, and weed control are primarily practiced in organically grown cool season vegetables [<CitationRef CitationID="CR48">48</CitationRef>]; however, hybrid tillage systems, in which only the soil between the crop rows is tilled, are being adapted for vegetable production [<CitationRef CitationID="CR49">49</CitationRef>]. A key research issue to address in this type of system is the development of postemergence weed management tactics. This necessitates greater accuracy of differentiating weeds and crop plants for more effective physical intrarow weed control options [<CitationRef CitationID="CR80">80</CitationRef>], whether it be cutting implements [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>], possibly shielded flame or steam weeders [<CitationRef CitationID="CR81">81</CitationRef>], and even air-propelled abrasives. Effective systems for IWM in cool season vegetable crops may be possible without pesticides or tillage over the entire field, but additional research to further optimize current systems will be required. While net economic returns and consistency of efficacy must be demonstrated to ensure that the potential of IWM systems can be successful, they must also be targeted for specific production systems.</Para>
