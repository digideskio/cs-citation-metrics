              <Para>In urban environments relatively high concentrations of NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> and PM<Subscript>10</Subscript> may occur in street canyons. To identify locations that exceed the EU-limit values and to predict the effect of potential reduction measures, a reliable model is essential. The Danish OSPM model for street canyons [<CitationRef CitationID="CR01271">1</CitationRef>] is based on the formation of a recirculation zone. The OSPM model calculates the concentrations of pollutants using a combination of a plume model for the direct contribution and a box model for the contribution of the recirculation zone. The (basics of the) OSPM model is widely used and successfully applied. The formulation of the OSPM model is implemented in STACKS [<CitationRef CitationID="CR01272">2</CitationRef>] and further extended.</Para>

              <Para>The OSPM model is suitable for busy streets with relative high buildings with respect to the width of the street. The original OSPM model assumes that (1) buildings form a continuous wall and (2) emissions are uniformly distributed across the canyon width. However, often there are open spaces between the buildings, e.g. in suburban roads with detached houses. In reality the emissions only occur over a limited part of the canyon i.e. the width of the traffic lanes. Limiting the emission to the traffic lanes will result in lower calculated concentrations near buildings, especially in wider streets and higher concentrations nearby the road. In order to extend the applicability of the model to a greater variety of canyon parameters the formulation was extended with respect to these assumptions.</Para>

              <Heading>Ventilation Factor</Heading>
              <Para>The space between buildings is implemented in the model with a ventilation factor (the fraction open space in between the buildings) i.e. a ventilation factor of 0 stands for a real street canyon and 1 for a street without buildings. The effect of the ventilation factor was studied using CFD calculations. Based on that study the transition is modeled as a linear relation with the fraction open space (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig01271">127.1</InternalRef>). <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig01271">

              <Para>The OSPM model calculates the concentrations of pollutants using a combination of a plume model and a box model. To limit the emissions to the traffic lanes, adaptations were needed in the calculation of the concentration from box as well as the direct plume. The concentrations in the recirculation zone in the OSPM model are based on that part of the canyon width that is in the recirculation zone. The changes for this part comprise the calculation of the contribution based on the fraction of the traffic lanes in the recirculation zone. The contribution of the plume in the original OSPM is calculated by integration of the direct plume along the wind path at street level. Here the adjustment concerns the reduction of the integration path to the path length over the traffic lanes.</Para>

              <Para>The agreement between measured and calculated concentrations is very well especially in wintertime (3,000–5,000 h). The slightly higher concentrations in the first 1,000 h can well be explained by the summer holidays: the traffic intensity will have been lower than the nominal intensity that was used in the calculations.</Para>
              <Para>The calculated concentrations are highly dependent on the wind direction. Therefore the concentrations were analyzed as function of the wind direction as well. As is shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig01273">127.3</InternalRef>, again a good agreement has been found between measured and calculated concentrations. A good agreement in the shape between measured and calculated data in this figure gives confidence in the basic assumptions of the model. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig01273">

              <Para>The Street canyon model in STACKS (based on OSPM) is extended with two parameters: the ventilation factor (amount of open space between buildings) and the width of the traffic lanes. The resulting model is successfully validated to a busy street in Rotterdam. With the presented adaptations the model is applicable for canyons with a greater variety of parameters.</Para>
