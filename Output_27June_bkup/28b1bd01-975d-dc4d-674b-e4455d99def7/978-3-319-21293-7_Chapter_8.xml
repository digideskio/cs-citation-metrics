          <Para ID="Par1">The aim of this Chapter is to present the basic characteristics of the Personal Health Record Systems (PHR-S) and indicate how the relevant platforms can serve as a basis for developing value added services such as a Care Management service. The basic features of a generic architectural approach for PHR-S are presented as well as the business challenges addressed by the proposed approach. In the context of StrokeBack an ICT-based post-stroke rehabilitation service was implemented. In order to support this service we designed and implemented a set of applications on top of the proposed PHR-S framework. The main features of these applications are also presented in this chapter.</Para>

      <Body>
        <Section1 ID="Sec1">
          <Heading>Personal Health Record Systems</Heading>
          <Para ID="Par2">The Personal Health Record System (PHR-S) comprises a controllable, self-contained, flexible, and extendable solution for supporting care management services and for managing associated patient data. According to the HL7 standards development organization, and more specifically the HL7 EHR Work Group [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>] the PHR-S is described as a patient centric tool that is controlled for the most part, by the individual. It is available electronically and can be linked to other health information systems. The PHR-S is intended to provide functionality to help an individual maintain a longitudinal view of his or her health history, and may be comprised of information from a plethora of sources. A PHR-S helps the individual to collect vital signs data (including data coming from medical monitoring devices), medication information, care management plans and the like, and can potentially connect to providers, laboratories, pharmacies, nursing homes, hospitals and other institutions, and clinical resources. At its core, the PHR-S provides the ability for the individual to capture health history in the form of a health summary, problems, conditions, symptoms, allergies, medications, laboratory and other test results, immunizations, and encounters. Additionally, personal care planning features such as advance directives and care plans can be available. Due to the nature of the collected information, the system must be secure and have appropriate identity and access management capabilities, and use standard nomenclature, coding and data exchange models for consistency and interoperability.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par3">Several commercial and open-source PHR-S are available in the market. For example, Microsoft HealthVault [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>] provides an online service to store and maintain health-related information. HealthVault features a thematic search engine, allowing users to search specifically for health-related information. Users can store personal medical records and prescription history, manage records, upload data from medical devices such as blood pressure monitors, and analyse and manage their data. The data can be shared with other health management web sites or directly with medical practitioners. HealthVault also features a desktop client that allows medical data pulled from personal health devices such as heart rate and blood-pressure monitors to be uploaded to the PHR-S. In the open-source domain, Tolven [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>] is a characteristic solution focusing on delivering electronic Personal Health Record (ePHR) that enables patients to record and selectively share healthcare information about themselves in a secure manner. Indivo X [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>] is another open-source PHR solution. It is promoted as Personally Controlled Health Record (PCHR), a platform that provides the means to create a PHR and also link other PHRs together.</Para>
        </Section1>
        <Section1 ID="Sec2">
          <Heading>A Generic Architecture for PHR-S</Heading>
          <Para ID="Par4">The proposed PHR-S is based on a modular architecture that enables easy addition or removal of desired functionality. We discriminate between the business domain layer components and the underlying technical framework. The business components reflect the needs of the end users of the specific application domain, while the underlying horizontal layers provide a generic, business agnostic functionality (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">8.1</InternalRef>).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

          <Para ID="Par5">Starting from the baseline, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Middleware Framework</Emphasis> layer offers flexible and loose connection between internal and external components of the PHR-S. The functionality supported by this layer is related to API management, services’ access rights management, user interface management, and presentation layer management.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par6">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Presentation Framework</Emphasis> layer aims at supporting application navigation and visualization in different browsers. The rationale behind the design of the Presentation Framework is to ensure independence of the graphical user interface (GUI) from the business domain layer. It is composed of a set of discrete components, as indicated in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">8.2</InternalRef>. For example, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">XSL &amp; XML Handler</Emphasis> offers a flexible GUI and manages the pages’ layout, while the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Translation Handler</Emphasis> is responsible for translating XML and XSL to HTML pages.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig2">

</Para>
          <Para ID="Par7">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Data Classification Management</Emphasis> layer provides a configurable and flexible data classification mechanism. It offers functionality related to patient data classification management, classification levels’ management, and data access rights’ management.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par8">Finally, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Authentication &amp; Authorization Management</Emphasis> layer provides functionality related to account management, as well as to the definition of authentication and authorization rules (role-based, e.g., admin, clinician, patient).</Para>
          <Para ID="Par9">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Business Domain</Emphasis> layer includes an expandable set of components that offer domain-specific functionality, such as the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Personal Health Record</Emphasis>, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Care Planning Tool</Emphasis>, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Collaboration Tool</Emphasis>, and the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Admin Tool</Emphasis>.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par10">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Personal Health Record</Emphasis> is an application that facilitates recording of data related to vital signs measurements, visits, surgeries, medications, symptoms, diagnoses (following the International Statistical Classification of Diseases &amp; Related Health Problems standard terminology [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]), patient documents, laboratory tests (orders and results’ presentation). The application makes use of the Presentation Framework to offer two flavors of the presentation layer: one for PC web browsers and another for mobile browsers.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par11">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Care Planning Tool</Emphasis> supports flexible set up of care plans and monitoring of their execution. In particular this component supports: care plan registration; set up of the list of actions that are appropriate for this plan, e.g., vital signs measurements, educational material, quality of life surveys, home visits, physical activity plan, nutrition plan, etc; care plan templates creation; care plan assignment to patient(s); care plan execution monitoring by the medical personnel, and; automatic care plan execution control, followed by appropriate notifications to the patients and the medical personnel.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par12">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Collaboration Tool</Emphasis> includes functionality related to collaboration between patients and their clinicians, e.g., videoconference, messaging (SMS, e-mail).</Para>
          <Para ID="Par13">Part of the Business Domain layer is also a set of components that support the domain-specific application and services. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Care Plan Resources Manager</Emphasis> provides functionality related to the configuration of the entities that constitute a care plan, e.g., vital signs collection, quality of life surveys, physical activity and exercises, nutrition, etc. This component is very useful at the configuration of the value added service on top of the PHR-S product as it can be used to reflect the exact management needs of the different diseases (e.g., diabetes, stroke, etc.).</Para>
          <Para ID="Par14">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Quality of Life Surveys Manager</Emphasis> features functionality to support questionnaires management (questionnaires registration and set up, questionnaires access rights management).</Para>
          <Para ID="Par15">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Record Sharing Manager</Emphasis> includes functionality that enables patients to share their PHR with other healthcare professionals.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par16">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Interoperability Manager</Emphasis> includes functionality related to HL7 v3 messaging, as well as generation and consumption of IHE profiles-based information [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. In particular, the Personal Health Record (XPHR) and the Care Management (CM) profiles are supported.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par17">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Resources Manager</Emphasis> supports registration and management of equipment that is dispatched to the patients in the course of a care plan (e.g., medical devices, smart phones, etc.). The supported functionality includes equipment registration management; equipment assignment management; and equipment info management.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par18">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Educational Material Manager</Emphasis> supports the registration and management of educational material related to chronicdiseases management. This material is accessed by the patients in the course of a care plan.</Para>

                <Para ID="Par23">A Care Planning Tool that facilitates clinicians and therapists in the management of the rehabilitation routine followed by their patients (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">8.4</InternalRef>). This routine includes a clinical assessment phase, during which the professionals fill in standard questionnaires related to the status of their patients (e.g., Barthel-Index, Stroke Specific Quality of Life and Wolf Motor Function Test questionnaires). They can review past entries and get info about what impact has the rehabilitation intervention in relevant indexes. They can also define specific goals for their patients, in accordance with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. The therapists use the tool to schedule training periods and introduce their suggestions for activities that should be pursued by their patients (e.g., serious games, music-supported therapy). These recommendations are stored in the PHR-S database and transferred to the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Patient Station</Emphasis> (see below) upon request. At a subsequent phase, an overview of the executed activities is presented to the healthcare professionals. The Care Planning Tool includes all the necessary medical and personal information that rehabilitation experts may need in order to evaluate the effectiveness and success of the rehabilitation process, e.g., to deduce relations between selected exercises and the rehabilitation evolution of different patients as well as to assess the overall healthiness of the patient. In addition, the Care Planning Tool can be used to provide the patient with midterm feedback related to her/his rehabilitation evolution compared to the average as well as to improvements over last day/weeks, in order to keep the motivation of patients high (this tool will be described in detail in this section);<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig4">

This feature may be particularly interesting when the user deals with an extended list of patients. The search criteria are the name and/or the surname and/or the condition of the patient (being active or not, i.e., a Training Period defined for this specific patient includes the current day).

              <Para ID="Par44">To do so, the user has to first press the Edit button of the specific Training Period in the Table, update the values of interest for the selected Training Period and press the Update button. Then, from the Table where the Training Periods are listed, the user selects the Training Period entry of interest and presses the “Training Units List” button. In the revealed page the user selects the TU from a drop-down list. Note that, if no TU file was uploaded for the patient, the drop down is empty. After selecting the TU file of interest the user should press the Save button. If more than one TU are defined for a Training Period, then the user has to define one of those TUs as the Current Training Unit. This will be the TU that will be first sent to the Home/Clinic Patient Station to be executed by the patient. Only upon successful exercises results upload of that TU, the next TU will be sent to the Station.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par45">Finally, the user can review the Exercise Results of the exercises executed during a specific Training Period (two examples are shown in Figs. <InternalRef RefID="Fig8">8.8</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Fig9">8.9</InternalRef>). If more than one Training Periods are available, the user shall select the Training Period of interest from the corresponding drop-down list. If no data is available for a specific Training Period, an indicative message is presented in the area where normally the graph would be presented. When exercise data is available, the View button appears in the corresponding line of the Training Period.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig8">

The main functionality of the web application for the IT administrators is related to the registration of users and assets in the PHR-S database. Only IT administrators can enter in this application, using the credentials that are provided by the Super Administrator, i.e., an entity of the ICT provider.
