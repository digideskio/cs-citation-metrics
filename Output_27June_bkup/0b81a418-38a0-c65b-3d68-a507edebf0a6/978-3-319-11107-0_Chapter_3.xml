          <Section1 ID="Sec1">
            <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par3" TextBreak="No">Leadership training programs for physicians continue to expand and are now offered through many mechanisms including surgical societies, professional organizations, and continuing medical education programs within academic centers, as well as in their affiliated health systems organizations. These programs have grown in an exponential fashion across the United States and abroad.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par4" TextBreak="No">Any program with the word “leadership” in the title appears to automatically imply that the organizing authority or promoting entity sponsoring such programs possesses the actual knowledge and the secret of providing what needs to be provided in order to prepare people for leadership. What can be further from the truth? A cursory examination of the current state of affairs throughout this country and the world would indicate that it is the lack of leadership that is at the center of what underlines most crises.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par5" TextBreak="No">At the risk of sounding terribly pessimistic or even “fatalistic”, it would appear that there is a great deficiency of level I evidence-based data regarding the value of these leadership training courses and the overall state of affairs regarding effective leadership. Perhaps there are many successful leaders out there all trained under these programs and each and every one of these leaders may be exercising effective leadership within their own world. Yet in our world “the one that affects us all”, we continue to see chaos and poor leadership. Just open the newspaper today, or better yet turn on your iPad to observe this crisis.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par6" TextBreak="No">Sadly, merely being in a leadership position or holding a position of authority does not necessarily mean that an individual in such position or with such responsibility will exercise leadership effectively. This is a common delusion that tints our daily lives and leaves us with great expectations and an equal number of frustrations emanating from our current “leaders” and their lack of effective leadership.</Para>

            <Heading>Leadership Vacuum</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par7" TextBreak="No">As surgeons and surgeon scientists, it should come to us a surprise that there is not a lot written about leadership as a science. Warren Benis in “The Challenges of Leadership in the Modern World” states that it is almost a cliché of leadership literature that a single definition of leadership is lacking [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par8" TextBreak="No">In most scientific disciplines, there are basic units of analysis and terms of reference which are generally understood within that discipline. Yet in the study of leadership, no such agreements upon conceptual foundations yet exist [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par9" TextBreak="No">JC Rost wrote that for many years the emphasis given by those who “teach” leadership has been centered in only two concerns of leadership, the peripheral aspect and the content. There has been little science developed aimed at understanding the essential nature of what leadership is. He goes on to say that it is crucial that scholars and practitioners interested in leadership concentrate on the fundamental principles (i.e., the science of leadership) for there is no possibility of framing a new paradigm of leadership if we cannot articulate what it is we are studying and practicing [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par10" TextBreak="No">Many of the complex challenges our world faces are not new and yet remain unresolved despite generations of effort. This vacuum requires that leaders go beyond their familiar various prescriptions for the world, and for the situations with which they are dealing, as Granger succinctly stated in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">3.1</InternalRef> [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

            </Para>
            <Para ID="Par11" TextBreak="No">More generally, to be a leader you must be able to exercise leadership with bosses, peers, those in other organizations, any others over whom you have no authority, and the people you’re the leader of before you have earned the right with them to lead.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par12" TextBreak="No">Time has come for us to dwell deeper into the very nature of the human being from the ontological view point; specifically, that is to say the nature and function of <Emphasis Type="Italic">being</Emphasis> for human beings, and to deepen our ability to distinguish the ontology of leader and leadership. If such a goal could be accomplished, then being a leader, and the effective exercise of leadership, should happen as one’s natural self-expression, rather than as a learned activity in trying to emulate the characteristics or styles of noteworthy leaders, or learning what effective leaders do and trying to emulate them.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par13" TextBreak="No">For those of us who are involved in the art of training young physicians to become surgeons, perhaps it may come easy to distinguish what it is to use a skill or a trait “as your natural self-expression”. We have certainly witnessed when some of our residents begin to perform in the operating room “naturally”; admittedly, this moment may come with experience, but we all have seen junior residents who are moving their hands “naturally” faster and earlier than some of our most vetted chief residents.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par14" TextBreak="No">I believe this paragon may serve us well to advance through this chapter in an effort to share with the reader a number of distinctions that must be part of the basic core of the ontology of leadership. Leadership ontology is what we all would like to master in order to be able to communicate those valuable skills or traits that will leave them not just being surgeons but being leaders as their natural self-expression.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par15" TextBreak="No">Although being a leader and being a surgeon are two completely different things, the previous example continues to be useful. If you are not <Emphasis Type="Italic">being</Emphasis> a leader and you are simply trying to act like a leader, you are likely to fail. This is a classic example of lack of authenticity that is deadly in an attempt to exercise leadership and most certainly deadly when pretending to be a surgeon. Fortunately, such circumstances occur infrequently in our surgical training programs. However, all of us have encountered individuals who eventually had to abandon their surgical residency program or their clinical practice because <Emphasis Type="Italic">being</Emphasis> a surgeon never came naturally to them despite that they may have mastered the epistemological aspects of surgery (i.e., the <Emphasis Type="Italic">knowing</Emphasis> of surgery rather than <Emphasis Type="Italic">being</Emphasis> a surgeon).</Para>
            <Para ID="Par16" TextBreak="No">This chapter is our first attempt to introduce the ontological basis of being a leader in the setting of training surgeons; the distinctions shared here and the resemblances between teaching how to become a surgeon and allowing young individuals to discover by themselves what it takes within themselves to be leaders may not necessarily apply to all circumstances. But whenever possible, we will continue to move freely between these two parallels not with the intention of confusing the reader, but certainly with the idea of taking advantage of the fact that most of us who stand on the left side of the operating room table while we let someone younger and less experienced operate under our responsibility are in a unique position to distinguish what it means to perform as our “natural self-expression”.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par17" TextBreak="No">The materials shared with you here are the result of participating in an innovative course on leadership that has been developed over the last 10 years, first under the auspices of the U. of Rochester Simon School of Business and later under the Air Force Academy. The technology and the course are founded on what the creators of the course term an ontological/phenomenological model of human nature. The ontological approach is uniquely effective in providing actionable access to being a leader and exercising leadership effectively. The course has been designed to leave participants being leaders and exercising leadership effectively as their natural self-expression, and to contribute to creating a new science of leadership. Some of the material is drawn from work published by Steve Zaffron: “Being A Leader and the Effective Exercise of Leadership: An Ontological Model” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. Other material summarized in this chapter is also based on program material of the Vanto Group, and from material presented in the Landmark Forum and other programs offered by Landmark Worldwide LLC [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. The unique ideas and the methodology created by Werner Erhard underlie much of the original work [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par18" TextBreak="No">An integral part of gaining access to being a leader and the effective exercise of leadership as one’s natural self-expression requires dealing with those factors present in all human beings that constrain each person’s freedom to be. When dealing with the ontology of leadership, our inability to find that freedom ends up constraining ourselves and shaping our own perceptions, emotions, creative imagination, thinking, planning, and actions. When one is not constrained or shaped by these factors, one’s way of being and acting must result naturally in one’s personal best. The “ontological constraints” must be discovered by the individual in his or her quest to become an effective leader. We will share with the reader some of the most common and basic ontological constraints so that they also begin to discover by themselves what stands in their way to effectively exercise leadership.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par19" TextBreak="No">The objective of this chapter is to introduce a new model of leadership and leadership development, and adapt the distinctions made available in this material to the current reality of residency training in surgery as a platform to present this material to those interested in promulgating leadership during the formative years of training as a surgeon. Although the ultimate objective of the full course being summarized in this chapter is to leave participants being leaders and exercising leadership as a their natural self-expression, this chapter will obviously fall short of such promise; it will simply be an introduction of the methodology and its usefulness, with the hope that we gather enough interest so that those in charge of resident education may contemplate the possibility of incorporating the material to teach the ontological aspects of leadership during the residency program.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par20" TextBreak="No">This material is significantly different from others the reader may have known or experienced. In fact, when teaching the ontological bases for leadership, we begin from the proposition that given <Emphasis Type="Italic">being</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">action</Emphasis> by the right context everyone has the capacity to be a leader and that in most cases there are personal obstacles (constraints) that everyone needs to discover and deal with in order to actualize that capacity for leadership. It is not about teaching leadership strategies or providing a “how to” guide, but rather it is simply allowing participants to create for themselves a context that will enable and empower them for being a leader as one’s natural self-expression.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par21" TextBreak="No">This is only possible by “being aware of”, which according to Souba is defined as a state that grants us the ability to perceive, to feel, and to be conscious of events, objects, and sensations [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. Awareness, as he describes it, speaks to the concept of a human being as an observer who is present in the moment especially to be attentive to distinguish one’s own filters and blind spots (ontological constraints).</Para>
            <Para ID="Par22" TextBreak="No">What we would like to share with you in this chapter is highly relevant, and certainly complementary, to those issues related to management be it of an academic nature or business nature. It is also related to organizational behavior, organizational change, and development. All of these topics are undoubtedly related to leadership, yet what we are referring to here IS NOT any of these other disciplines. Therefore, we request that during the reading of this chapter you (the reader) avoid any attempt to make what you read “like” any of these other disciplines listed above.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par23" TextBreak="No">We would like to further emphasize this point by sharing with you a quote from Claude Bernard, the father of modern physiology and the founder of experimental medicine as a scientific method: <Emphasis Type="Italic">“It is what we already know that often prevent us from learning”.</Emphasis> While reading this chapter we request that you do not attempt to make this like anything you already know. We understand this may be a human tendency, but allowing yourself to think that this is like something you already have seen will prevent you from distinguishing what will be discussed next.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par24" TextBreak="No">In the following sections we will share with you a number of distinctions that, given under the methodology on the ontology of leadership, are designed to provide actionable access to leader and leadership. We are concerned specifically with the nature and impact of <Emphasis Type="Bold">being</Emphasis> when being a leader.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par25" TextBreak="No">As we mentioned earlier, we would like to generate enough curiosity and interest on the distinctions of the ontological bases of leadership that the reader will seek to participate in the full content of this material offered elsewhere. This material is being taken up by the academic realm, and many universities in the United States are incorporating such material in full semester courses that continue to burgeon. The complete material can also be taken in a full 8 days compressed format as well [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par26" TextBreak="No">At the end, however, the ultimate objective of distinguishing the ontological basis of leadership is to get the participants to live a personal transformation; the participants are not expected to have all the experience and knowledge that is necessary to be a truly extraordinary leader. However, they should leave ready to be who they need to be to be a leader and with what it takes for them to exercise leadership effectively.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par27" TextBreak="No">There are three major components that make the ontological bases for leadership. The first one is the foundational elements of leadership and these are: <OrderedList>

            <Heading>The Four Foundational Elements of Leadership</Heading>
            <Section2 ID="Sec4">
              <Heading>Integrity</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par33" TextBreak="No">
                <Emphasis Type="Italic">“Integrity is a matter of a person’s word-nothing more and nothing else”</Emphasis> (Michael Jensen). Integrity refers to the condition of an object, person, or organization as being whole, complete, and perfect [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. Integrity is an <Emphasis Type="Bold">indispensable</Emphasis> condition for functionality and workability. In fact, when we act with lack of integrity, our performance is diminished and the degree of energy required to maintain our own functionality is directly proportional to the lack of integrity.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par34" TextBreak="No">Integrity is what it takes for a person to be whole and complete. An individual is whole and complete when their word is whole and complete, and their word is whole and complete when they honor their word. There are only two ways of honoring our word: first, by keeping our word, and that means keeping our word on time; and second, by realizing that when you cannot keep your word you immediately inform all parties who were counting on you to keep your word and clean up any mess that you have caused in their lives by not keeping your word. When we do this, we are honoring our word despite having not kept it, and we have maintained our integrity [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. If you fail to see that who you are as a person is your word, that is, thinking that you are anything other than your word, it leaves you unable to see that when your word is less than complete, you are diminished as a person.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par35" TextBreak="No">Being your word requires transparency about what one is giving one’s word to, to whom it is being given, and by when the promise given by the word will be attained. In the absence of this foundation, exceptional performance is not possible and definitely not sustainable, making any attempts to effective leadership completely futile. In being a leader, you must think very carefully before giving your word to anyone or anything and beware of giving your word to two or more things that may be mutually inconsistent. If you want to be up to anything important in life, you will not always be able to keep your word, and that is alright, but if you are a person of integrity you will always honor your word. At the end, honoring your word is the only actionable route to being trusted by others.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par36" TextBreak="No">The distinction of integrity is easy to follow and most of us would agree with the statements made above, yet a conversation about integrity is not complete unless we all recognize that the most important aspect of integrity involves the relationship one has with oneself. By not being solemn when we give our word to ourselves, we lose the opportunity to maintain our integrity, that is, honoring our word to ourselves. As a direct consequence of our own lack of integrity, we create unworkability in our life: people will see our inconsistencies, and we will appear unreliable and unpredictable. Unfortunately, most of us are quick to rationalize and justify the “background” mess of our own everyday life and fail to see that such mess is a direct consequence of not having integrity.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par37" TextBreak="No">A common mistake is to consider integrity as a virtue instead of an essential condition for performance. When held merely as a virtue rather than as an element of production integrity is easily sacrificed when it appears that a person must do so to succeed. Furthermore, when seen as a virtue it may then generate the admiration of others. Admiration turns out to be something more valuable than money and as such is venerated as the highest currency existing today. Let me explain why. We all want to be admired. Any situation that threatens us with a loss of admiration can easily lead us to out of integrity behavior.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par38" TextBreak="No">Integrity is a mountain with no top. It is our human condition that constantly makes us unaware that we have not kept our word. Most of the time all we see are the reasons, rationalization, or excuses for not keeping our word. In fact, people systematically deceive themselves about who they have been and what they have done. “Put simply, people consistently act inconsistently unaware of the contradiction between their espoused theory and their actual theory, i.e., between the way they think they are acting and the way they really act” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par39" TextBreak="No">In fact, the combination of: (1) often not seeing our own out of integrity behavior, (2) believing that we are people of integrity, and (3) soothing ourselves with the notion that next time we will restore ourselves to being a person of integrity keeps us from realizing that these perpetuating rules place us in a mountain with no top. Our best bet is to recognize this fact and keep climbing; indeed, life should be about learning to enjoy the climb rather than whining about the slope, and not forgetting that the higher you climb the steeper it gets [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par40" TextBreak="No">Therefore, to empower and enable yourself as a leader, you will have to be rigorous in honoring your word – with yourself, with those you lead, and with those who lead you. Living in a constant quest for integrity can be seen as the best practice for being a leader.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par41" TextBreak="No">Lastly, integrity must be looked at as a purely positive proposition. It has nothing to do with good versus bad. It is rather, a law, like the law of gravity. There is no such a thing as good or bad gravity. Like integrity, it just “is”. More importantly, integrity is a necessary condition for maximum performance. As integrity declines, workability declines and as workability declines, value also declines. Attempting to violate the law of integrity generates painful consequences just as surely as attempting to violate the law of gravity [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>].</Para>

            <Section2 ID="Sec5">
              <Heading>Authenticity</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par42" TextBreak="No">The word authentic originates from the Greek word <Emphasis Type="Italic">authentes</Emphasis> meaning “one acting on one’s own authority”. In other words, one is accountable for one’s actions and behaviors. Being authentic is being and acting consistent with who you hold yourself out to be for others and who you hold yourself to be for yourself [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. Being authentic has a direct implication on our ability, or lack thereof, to recognize our out of integrity behaviors. Said in another way, it is our desire for approval and admiration that often drives inauthentic actions and behaviors. Souba, in writing about this subject, describes our attraction to the six As – admiration, achievement, attention, authority, appearance and affluence – as powerful lures towards inauthenticity. He goes on to say that “this inevitable ‘thrownness’ to self-concern dislodges us from the full possibility of being with others and is a major source of our inauthenticity” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par43" TextBreak="No">Being authentic is critical to being a leader. Inauthenticity is one of the barriers to being a leader and to having access to the effective exercise of leadership. The ideal scenario to empower students to be effective leaders is best realized by giving to them the opportunity to recognize their own inauthenticities. While most of us don’t like seeing them, by distinguishing these weaknesses in ourselves, we will open the doors to the pathway towards authenticity. In fact, it is easy to recognize that sometimes we find ourselves being limited in our ability to perform, out of fear of the loss of admiration, fear of being accused of being disloyal, or fear of looking bad. When you are appreciative of such insights and welcome them, you will benefit from them.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par44" TextBreak="No">How can we begin to overcome such fears? Is there an ontological response to these challenges? Tillich in his book “The Courage to Be” states: “courage as the universal and essential self-affirmation of one’s being is an ontological concept [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. The courage to be is the act in which a man or a woman affirms his/her own being in spite of those elements of his/her existence which conflicts with his/her essential self-affirmation.” Yet in our world it is perhaps something even less threatening than fear that prevents us from meaningful leadership. A tendency to accept a simple role of spectator by allowing ourselves to sink into a <Emphasis Type="Italic">stalling</Emphasis> realm of passivity may be the prevailing attitude of modern society. There is a disengagement associated with submissiveness that according to John Gardner is the greatest danger looming on our world. Our comfortable way of being is thwarting us from seeking the experience of participating in meaningful decisions concerning our own life and work [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par45" TextBreak="No">The emphasis on authenticity while sharing this material on the ontology of leadership refers to the simple fact that being authentic is a requirement for being a leader. The trainer is not concerned on the good or bad or the right or wrong of neither being inauthentic, nor do they offer an examination of anything normative. The ultimate goal is to help our students to discover their own path to authenticity.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par46" TextBreak="No">We all want to be admired, and almost none of us is willing to confront just how much we want to be admired, and how readily we will fudge on being straightforward and completely honest in a situation where we perceive doing so threatens us with a loss of admiration. Indeed, we spend a lot of our time on the run “doing” – achieving, impressing, acquiring, and parleying in order to measure up, be popular, and be accepted. We always appreciate and listen carefully for confirmation that what we are saying is accepted as right. In fact, “admiration is the highest coin in the realm” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. We will do anything to be admired and the loss of authenticity seems a small price to pay, especially when we don’t even notice that we are being inauthentic and even if we did, are unaware that being inauthentic costs us being whole and complete as a person. In addition, most of us have a pathetic need for looking good, and almost none of us are willing to confront just how much we care about looking good – even to the extent of the silliness of pretending to have followed and understood something when we haven’t. The threat of looking bad destroys the possibility of being authentic. Here is when courage becomes extremely handy; anyone who wants to be a leader needs courage to be straight when he or she is wrong.</Para>

              <Heading>Being Committed to Something Bigger Than Oneself</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par47" TextBreak="No">The word commitment is derived from the Latin word <Emphasis Type="Italic">committere</Emphasis> meaning to unite, connect, and bring together. It also means a pledge or an obligation of oneself. In the act of leading, leaders begin as ordinary people yet by the time when we learn about their accomplishments they all appear to be extraordinary people. However, when the story is told every great leader started as an ordinary person who was given being and action by something bigger than themselves. When we assume that only extraordinary people can be leaders, we are actually ignoring or depreciating what must have taken for someone to go beyond what they were before being leaders. If we tell our students that they need to be extraordinary people to be leaders, we are automatically concealing their access to being a leader.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par48" TextBreak="No">Quoted directly from the creators of this material [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>], on Being a Leader and the Effective Exercise of Leadership: An Ontological/Phenomenological Model: <Emphasis Type="Italic">“If you aspire to be a great leader, your life and your career or schooling and your relationships will have to be about something bigger than you, something bigger than your concerns for yourself – even bigger than the hopes, dreams, and grand ideas of the person you ‘wound up being’. And that surely includes something bigger than your dreams about your personal fame, position, authority, or money. If that is what is giving you being and action, you can forget about being a leader. Are you a stand for something beyond yourself – something you are willing to give your life to? Without that, for you there will be no chance of greatness.”</Emphasis>
              </Para>
              <Para ID="Par49" TextBreak="No">So, it is a matter of choice really; everyone has to make a choice between going in the same way that we ended up being or going beyond that so that the purpose of our lives, our careers, schooling, and our relationships is about something bigger than ourselves. Equally important, when given the opportunity to lead, one must recognize the personal concerns of those we lead and appreciate how important these concerns appear to be for them. It is ineffective to make these concerns wrong. As a leader, you will be better starting with the commitments of the people you are leading. Then, you may lead them to something greater.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par50" TextBreak="No">Most of us may spend great part of our lives seeking, for the purpose of our careers or our schooling, to be something bigger than ourselves. In doing so we may experience hopelessness or inadequacies from time to time. Unfortunately the longer this takes the more difficult it will be to free ourselves of such feelings and then it may be too late. Therefore, we must be careful, since being committed to something bigger than ourselves may be the only thing that will make us move beyond who we ended up being. We must work hard to identify what is it that we need to be committed to that will make us great.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par51" TextBreak="No">“What is your life about, and what are your career or schooling or relationships currently about – that is, what is your purpose in life, and what is the purpose of your career or schooling or relationships?” In order to answer these questions, you must be ruthlessly honest about your willingness to do the work to be bigger than the way you wound up being – leadership begins with leading yourself!</Para>
              <Para ID="Par52" TextBreak="No">Just be honest with yourself about what your life and your career or schooling and your relationships are about, and do it without any evaluations or judgments – that is, without making it wrong or right in any way.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par53" TextBreak="No">The material we are sharing with the reader in this chapter is a rather succinct version of the process necessary to provide individuals with a real opportunity to create for themselves a standing for something bigger than their own concerns.

              <Heading>Being Cause–in-the-Matter</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par54" TextBreak="No">The fourth element that constitutes the foundation for being a leader and exercising leadership is referred to here as being cause-in-the-matter of everything in our life as a stand we take from ourselves and life that is acting from that stand. This distinction may not appear as clear to us at the beginning; it is perhaps the distinction that lends itself for more than one depiction. So in an attempt to briefly expand on the meaning of being cause-in-the-matter, we will divide this discussion in two separate topics.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par55" TextBreak="No">The first one has to do with the stand we take in our lives, that is, where do I see myself in relation to everything else that is not me, how do I interact with life and other people. The second aspect of being cause-in-the-matter has to do with the degree of awareness that I have, or that I may need to develop, in order to realize all that needs to be realized, discovered, and dealt with for me to be free to act and interact with life and everything else that is not me. A profound dissertation on the philosophical foundations of existentialism and the thinking of Heidegger as the father of the study of being and the ontological bases of existing are beyond the scope of this chapter [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. A great deal of the material and the writings by those who mastered the ontological bases of leadership are available to us; however, for the purpose of this chapter we will limit ourselves to distinguish a few thoughts about the meaning of <Emphasis Type="Italic">being aware of</Emphasis> and the way we <Emphasis Type="Italic">interact</Emphasis> with all that is not us in life, so that leaders can exercise leadership [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par56" TextBreak="No">There are several aspects that deal with the neuroscience principles that are at the center of the role we play in both of these aspects (i.e., our awareness and our interactions). These subjects are discussed with some detail elsewhere [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. Therefore, we will not describe them here. We will simply say that no human being is fully aware. While the brain processes millions of bits of sensory input every second, we are consciously aware of only a tiny fraction of them. The brain is constantly anticipating events that are the result of what we have in our memory and that have evolved from millions of years [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>]. In fact, the brain’s mental constructs are built from deeply ingrained and internalized assumptions and generalizations that are constantly influencing how we interact in our lives and what we filter or move aside [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>]. Revealing the hidden and unchallenged assumptions, beliefs, and frames of reference that compromise our worldview is critical to effective leadership. Because of the many limitations and distortions that these biases create in our way of being, we may not be able to authentically listen to others, and by doing so, we constrain the otherwise endless possibilities available to us for leading effectively. Dr. Souba writes: “Our mental models are not so much views and beliefs that we hold tightly as they are views and beliefs that tightly hold us.” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>] He goes on to say, “All leaders dwell in already made clearings, some of which have become cluttered with antiquated worldviews, cognitive maps, and other hidden cultural baggage.” Effective leadership requires that one be a cause-in-the-matter by cleaning up and freeing ourselves from these constraints in order to create the optimal conditions for unrestricted possibilities of being a leader.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par57" TextBreak="No">What is meant by the term cause-in-the-matter is not any of the following: fault, blame, shame, guilt, burden, obligation, credit, or praise. For many people having caused something (“you did it”) cannot be seen as anything other than fault and the like, or credit and the like. It is important to distinguish that the term cause-in-the-matter used within the context of the ontological bases for leadership has no relation to assigning blame or credit, who is at fault, or who made it happen (i.e., who should be rewarded).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par58" TextBreak="No">The term cause-in-the-matter must be used as a declaration for which one is willing to stand, a declaration made on a commitment that gives us an empowering perspective from which to view some condition. In exercising leadership, who is at fault or to blame, or who gets the credit, or even who actually did it conveys no power to anyone. In fact, it is more likely to be disempowering [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. Ultimately, the stand you have taken in the matter is a new, separate, distinct place from which to view the facts of the condition you may be confronted with. By doing so you will be able to see opportunities to be effective that you simply could not see with any other context. Conversely, when our way of being and acting prevents us from, and stands in the way of, being cause-in-the-matter then we are <Emphasis Type="Italic">at the effect</Emphasis> of any given situation. The resulting effect is that we lack power. We’re not saying that, because we lack power, that the situation is bad or that we are bad; we’re just saying that to the degree we are at effect, we lack power.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par59" TextBreak="No">Power is always an exercise of something. Power equals the size of your intentions divided by the time it takes for your intentions to get realized. When I do not honor my word, I diminish power. The less authenticity I have the less power I have. When I am committed to myself I have little power. When I am at the effect I have no power. When you have as your foundation being a person of integrity, being authentic, being committed to something bigger than yourself, and being-cause-in-the-matter, you have given yourself a foundation that is truly powerful.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par60" TextBreak="No">Reich in 1928 wrote about power: “Anything that comes out of you and goes out into the world is power and in addition to that, the ability to be open, to appreciate, to receive love, to respond to others, to listen to music, to understand literature, all of that is power. When you “lead” someone against their will, that is not power at all, that is force, and force is the negation of power.” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]</Para>

            <Para ID="Par61" TextBreak="No">We have so far reviewed the four foundational elements required for effective leadership. In the next section we will briefly summarize what the writers on the ontology of leadership refer to as the contextual framework.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par62" TextBreak="No">Before describing how the contextual framework is built, we need to remember the original methodology of the ontological bases of leadership and the specific approach to leadership based in what we called transformational learning. This methodology is used to provide individuals with an opportunity to examine and eliminate the grip of their everyday common-sense worldview and their existing frames of reference (received ideas, beliefs, and unexamined assumptions) relative to leader and leadership. Then, the methodology provides individuals with an opportunity to create for themselves a context for leader and leadership that shapes and colors any leadership situation they deal with, such that their natural self-expression (their naturally correlated way of being and acting) in dealing with that situation is one of being a leader and exercising leadership effectively.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par63" TextBreak="No">How do you create a context? It will not be possible for us to enter into a comprehensive discussion about this methodology here. Perhaps a simple example quoted directly from the material on the ontology of leadership will help the reader to see how a context can be empowering and change everything by the way we react to a specific situation at any given moment and time.</Para>

            <Heading>The Power of a Context and Its Impact on Way of Being and Acting</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par64" TextBreak="No">An example of the power of a context: playing the violin in a subway. <Emphasis Type="Italic">“Dressed in jeans and a baseball cap, a 39 year-old ‘fiddler’ stood against a wall next to a trash can at the L’Enfant Plaza metro station in Washington D.C. He looked like any other street musician trying to make a buck. During the 43 minutes that he played his violin, researchers watched 1,097 people pass by during the morning rush hour. It took 3 minutes before someone even gazed in his direction, and even longer before any money was thrown into his violin case. Most people did not notice the musician. Some were talking on cell phones, others listened to iPods. Masterful pieces such as Bach’s “Chaconne”, Franz Schubert’s “Ave Maria”, and Manuel Ponce’s “Estrellita”, were passed off as nothing more than “generic classical music” (Weingarten, 2007). That day, the fiddler made $32.17, or 75 cents a minute. When situated within an upscale concert hall dressed in black, the same 39 year-old ‘fiddler’, Joshua Bell, on the same $3.5 million Stradivari violin, commands up to $1,000 a minute playing the exact same masterpieces. This elite musician is said to be “one of the finest classical musicians in the world, playing some of the most elegant music ever written on one of the most valuable violins ever made” (Weingarten, 2007).”</Emphasis> [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]</Para>
            <Para ID="Par65" TextBreak="No">Within the context of a subway street musician, a measly seven people were moved to stop and listen before walking by. Within the context of a famous concert hall musician, thousands of listeners invest significant money to hear and be moved by Bell’s music. The context uses you in that it shapes your way of being, which includes your perceptions, imagination, emotions, and thinking, and as a consequence the context shapes your actions.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par66" TextBreak="No">One of the most interesting aspects about the ontological bases of leadership is the ability to connect how our brain works (based on the current knowledge derived from neuroscientists and their experiments depicted within the material) and how we respond to different situations in our daily lives and in dealing with others that would require from us being effective leaders.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par67" TextBreak="No">Recent findings in the area of neuroscience have established that neural patterns of perception (phenomenologically speaking, the way something occurs to a person) and the neural patterns that give rise to a person’s way of being and acting are virtually always, as neuroscientists term it, “networked” together in the brain. This means that the neural patterns that give rise to a person’s way of being are networked together with neural patterns of perception (including stored neural perception patterns – memory); and likewise the neural patterns that give rise to action are also networked with those neural patterns of perception. This is what Libet [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>], in his book Neurophysiology of Consciousness, summarize as follows – “… the brain ‘decides’ to initiate or, at least, to prepare to initiate the acts before there is any reportable subjective awareness that such a decision has taken place.” Both, Clancey [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>] in 1993 and later Hawkins and Blakeslee [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>] in 2004 arrived at the same conclusion: “Perceiving, thinking, and moving always occur together as coherent coordination of activity,” in other words, as if “perception and behavior are almost one in the same.”</Para>
            <Para ID="Par68" TextBreak="No">For the purposes of bringing this point across and in order to make practical sense of it, let’s assume for a moment that a “leadership situation” could be defined simply as: a situation in which the current circumstances, and the possible futures (outcomes) that can be realized in the prevailing context for those circumstances, are unacceptable or non-optimal.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par69" TextBreak="No">As we said before, a person’s way of being and acting in any leadership situation is correlated with the way in which the situation they are dealing with occurs for them. Therefore, for a person to be a leader and to exercise leadership effectively, the situation they are dealing with must occur for them such that their naturally correlated way of being and acting is that of actually being a leader and exercising leadership effectively. Given that in any leadership situation a person’s way of being and acting is a correlation of the way the situation occurs for them, the way in which the situation occurs for them is the actionable access to the being of being a leader and the actions of the effective exercise of leadership as their natural self- expression. And put simply, the actionable access to the way in which a leadership situation occurs for a person is the context that person brings to or creates for leadership situations.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par70" TextBreak="No">It is plausible that if we were to dedicate some time during the formative years of the residency program (and beyond) to specifically use these ontological methods so that young individuals training to be surgeons could at the same time experience a shift of what it really means to be a leader, then a different context about leadership could be created. A context in which the individual is committed to something bigger than his or her own agenda, a context that “uses” the individual and allows for a new will to challenge deeply held assumptions or a habitual way of being, then the possibility for a meaningful transformation becomes real.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par71" TextBreak="No">As Souba writes, “Ontologically, this leadership approach entails an inward journey of self-discovery and reinvention. In the cognitive, affective, and behavioral neuroscience realm, it is about letting go of our obsolete or predetermined mental maps that hold us back from exercising more effective leadership. Electrophysiologically, this new learning involves re-wiring of neural circuits. Functionally, this leadership journey enhances our workability, performance, and joy in life” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par72" TextBreak="No">Anyone interested in being a leader as his or her natural self-expression, must practice every day in order to rewire those circuits that Souba is referring to in the previous paragraph. The prevailing tendency in our brain is to go for the default set of solutions (or contexts); after all that has worked out well for human beings from an evolutionary view point. A leader must be aware of the challenges ahead so that the context to be created is not just another default context. Leaders fail when the future they are trying to create becomes just an enhanced, augmented or improved version of the SAME future. If one can see possibilities for resolving a situation in the prevailing context, there is no need for leadership. All that this requires is competent management.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par73" TextBreak="No">While people may consciously have hopes and dreams, and worries and doubts, and goals and strivings regarding the future, the brain, below the level of consciousness, only has patterns from the past from which to predict the future. The brain shapes a person’s way of being and action in the present to be consistent with realizing the brain’s predicted future. As we have already described, neuroscience studies confirm that brain activity selects an action even before the person experiences consciously choosing that action [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par74" TextBreak="No">This explains in part, why life for most people is “business as usual”. They may do more of what they have done, but that is just more of the past. Or, they may do what they have done in the past, but better. However, “better than the past” is still more of the past; “better than the past” is only a reshaping of what they have done in the past.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par75" TextBreak="No">In fact, neuroscientists consider that the evolutionary survival value of the brain’s storing memories of the past is purely their value in predicting the future. The brain initiates those ways of being and acting in the present that are most likely to ensure success, which for the brain is the realization of that past-derived predicted future. This is the way our brains evolved to best ensure survival. Consistent with this, MRI studies show that virtually the same regions of the brain are active both when we think about the past and when we think about the future [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>]. It is intuitive to state that if all of our behaviors are evolutionarily conserved then this concept should apply not only for all of our behavioral traits but also for the traits that go along with making a good leader. Without excellent leaders our species would not have survived and evolved.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par76" TextBreak="No">You may think then that our hope for change, specifically in our ability to create or educate other people about a new context for leadership, may be dismal. The facts indicate that the prevailing context is the future people are living into, and the future that people are living into is by default derived from and shaped by the past. Remember, the context is decisive. That means that, in the default context, people’s being and action in the present will result in more of the same. It may be more, better, different, or a change, but it will still be some variation of the past.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par77" TextBreak="No">In order to break this cycle, that is to create an intervention that is capable of bringing about a discontinuous future, a future that is not a continuation of the past, we have only one option: language. It is through language that we can bring forth something that revises one’s worldview, frame of reference, or context. In fact, language is our path into what is revealed about the nature and function of human beings from the perspective of being.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par78" TextBreak="No">When you see someone being a leader or exercising leadership, or when you have experienced being led, you see someone functioning in the sphere of language.

There may be surprising examples that may help us distinguish when being a leader exists as a leader in a realm of possibilities: There are instances in which you can only be effective as a leader by being a follower. There are instances in which you can only be effective as a leader by being a bystander, and there are frequent instances in which you can only be effective as a leader by saying and doing nothing, just listening in a certain way. That certain way of listening means to listen authentically; it is critical to be aware of our listening as W Erhard states, “…to exercise leadership effectively, one must be masterful in empowering others to see for themselves actual errors in their thinking, and masterful in enhancing their valid thinking…”.</Para>

            <Heading>The Third Component Is the Ontological Constraints</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par101" TextBreak="No">There are many constraints that constantly stand between us and our ability to best and <Emphasis Type="Italic">naturally</Emphasis> exercise effective leadership. These constraints relate directly to how we see the world that surrounds us and how things occur to us. It is not about the state of our minds, which is what we refer to under the psychological method. When distinguishing the ontological bases for leadership, it is fundamentally important to be able to establish the differences between the psychological method and the ontological method. Although both methods are available to us in order to deal with all that may interfere with a person’s effectiveness in life, the psychological methods deal with those “interferences” as problems of the mind (mental and emotional disorders). The psychological method therefore uses language with the ultimate goal of having an impact on the mind. Quite differently, when the ontological method is used, it should give us access through language so that we discover by ourselves the distortions in the meaningfulness or clarity of the way the world, others, and oneself occur for one.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par102" TextBreak="No">The strongest constraint that may interfere with our ability to interact with others as effective leaders is a perceptual constraint referred to as “<Emphasis Type="Italic">already-always-listening”.</Emphasis> This is the typical constraint that is already there in our listening before we hear anything.

            <Para ID="Par105" TextBreak="No">Let us finish by sharing with you a piece of one of the most beautiful writings about the new context that leadership needs to be. It comes from a “story” told by Dr. Souba entitled “The dream: A leadership fable” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>]. In it, the author compares our humanity with a worldwide corporation that has lost its compass and like our current world appears to be spinning out of control. A world where the context of leadership is so obtuse that members of the humanity corporation truly believe that leadership must be the sole possession of one person rather than something people create by working together. A world where petty self-interested people feel that they are more important that the other members of humanity. A world where the designated leaders are merely people in charge with the authority to call the shots and if necessary “kick butt.” Souba finishes by adding that the “humanity corporation” is at a critical juncture and that only through a new context in leadership, will every member of humanity be called to make life better. These are choices we all must make to build the kind of future that humanity and life were designed to have.</Para>
