              <Para>Epidemiologic studies of air pollution have traditionally relied upon surrogates of personal pollutant exposures, such as ambient concentration measurements from fixed-site pollutant monitors. This study evaluates the performance of alternative measured and modeled exposure metrics for multiple particulate and gaseous pollutants, in the context of different epidemiologic studies performed by EPA, Rutgers/Rochester/LBNL and Emory/Georgia Tech researchers. Alternative exposure estimation approaches used, included: central site or interpolated monitoring data, regional pollution levels based on measurements or models (CMAQ) and local scale (AERMOD) air quality models, hybrid models, statistically blended modeling and measurement data, concentrations adjusted by home infiltration rates based on LBNL algorithms, and population human exposure (SHEDS and APEX) model predictions. The Emory/Georgia Tech team examined the acute morbidity effects of ambient traffic-related pollutants (CO, NOx, PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> and PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> EC) and ozone using time series analyses of emergency department (ED) visits and case-crossover analysis of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) detected ventricular arrhythmias in Atlanta, GA. The Rutgers/Rochester/LBL team examined the associations between PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> mass and its species with myocardial infarction (case-crossover study) and adverse birth outcomes (cohort study) in New Jersey. Initially, the various exposure indicators/metrics were compared in terms of their ability to characterize the spatial and temporal variations of multiple ambient air pollutants across the different study areas. These metrics were then used to examine associations between ambient air pollution and adverse health effects. Next, pollutant–specific relative risks (RRs) obtained from epidemiologic analyses of the alternative exposure metrics were evaluated against those obtained from using a conventional approach (i.e., central site data alone). Pollutant and metric dependent exposure prediction differences were found in some cases, indicating a non-uniform exposure prediction error structure across pollutants. Results suggest the need for additional refinements to methods used to estimate exposures in support of different types of air pollution epidemiologic studies.</Para>

              <Para>Numerous air pollution epidemiology studies conducted to-date have used measurements from central site ambient monitors to estimate population exposures to air pollution. However, depending on the epidemiological study design, this approach may introduce exposure prediction errors and misclassification of exposures for pollutants that are spatially heterogeneous, such as those associated with traffic emissions (e.g., carbon monoxide, elemental carbon, nitrogen oxides and fine and ultrafine particulate matter). Moreover, central-site monitors do not account for multitude of factors that influence personal exposures and associated health effects of ambient pollutants such as, elevated concentrations/exposures near localized emissions sources, variations in infiltration of outdoor pollutants indoors either at home or in other microenvironments, demographic human activity and mobility patterns and indoor pollution exposures. Exposure prediction errors resulting from the use of simple surrogates of personal exposure, such as central-site measurements, may in turn influence the strength and significance of the inferences derived from epidemiologic investigations [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00111">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00112">2</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>In order to enhance the results from epidemiologic studies of ambient PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript>, PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> components and gaseous air pollution, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently sponsored a collaborative agreement research program with three academic institutions: Emory University, Rutgers University and University of Washington. The investigators from these institutions, along with modelers from EPA’s National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) developed and evaluated several indicators or tiers of air pollution exposure metrics (ranging from simple to more complex indicators or predictors of exposure) and their influence on epidemiological study finding in several locations in the US. This presentation summarizes the key findings for the Emory/Georgia Tech study conducted in the Atlanta metropolitan area and the Rutgers study conducted in the State of New Jersey.</Para>

              <Para>The Atlanta study area is centered on downtown Atlanta and extends 70 km in all directions. This study examined the spatial and temporal variations of alternative measured and modeled exposure metrics for multiple pollutants: fine particulate matter (PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript>), PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> elemental carbon, PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> sulfates, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and ozone. Alternative exposure assignment approaches considered various techniques ranging from traditional central site ambient measurements to more sophisticated exposure models, such as the SHEDS (Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation) and the APEX (Air Pollutants Exposure) models. Six alternative indicators of exposure to ambient traffic and regional pollutants were developed for use in time-series analyses of emergency department (ED) visits and case-crossover analyses of tachyarrhythmic events in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) in Atlanta, GA, over a 4-year period, 1999–2002 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00113">3</CitationRef>]. The exposure metrics included several indicators at varying levels of exposure refinement. Under the first tier of refinement, existing ambient fixed-site monitoring data were used for CO, NO<Subscript>x</Subscript>, O<Subscript>3</Subscript>, PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript>, SO<Subscript>4</Subscript>, and EC (metric i), as well as estimates of the regional background for each of the pollutants obtained by removing local source impacts estimated by an emissions-based air quality model (AERMOD) from ambient monitor observations and then spatially resolving the regional background estimates using a previously developed distance-squared weighting approach (metric ii) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00114">4</CitationRef>]. Under the second tier of refinement, an air quality emissions model (AERMOD, metric iii) and hybrid and blended models (metric iv) were used to obtain spatially-resolved estimates of ambient concentrations at 225 zipcode centroids (for the ED study) and over 400 Census Block Group centroids, for the ICD study [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00111">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00115">5</CitationRef>]. Under the final two tiers of exposure refinement in the ED study, spatially- and temporally-resolved estimates of air exchange rates (AER) as an exposure factor (metric v) and outputs from APEX and SHEDS modeling (metric vi) were utilized as estimates of population exposures for each of the pollutants of interest. Health risk estimates from models using the various exposure metrics were then compared and evaluated for each pollutant and health outcome.</Para>

              <Heading>New Jersey Study</Heading>
              <Para>Two different epidemiologic heath data sets in New Jersey were chosen: (1) The New Jersey (NJ) Triggering of Myocardial Infarction (MI) Study and (2) The NJ Adverse Birth Outcomes Study. The MI study used a time-stratified case-crossover design, with case periods defined as the 24 h period before emergency room (ER) admission for MI. The Birth study was a cohort study examining associations between fetal growth restriction and trimester-specific mean PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> concentrations. Epidemiologic analyses examined the association between the health outcome and PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> exposure, using four different exposure surrogates: Tier 1 – central site PM<Subscript>2.5;</Subscript> Tier 2a – exposures estimated using the Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation (SHEDS) model; Tier 2b – indoor concentrations of ambient PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> predicted using a deterministic mass balance model (Aerosol Penetration and Persistence, APP, model) and an air exchange rate model (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Infiltration Model); and Tier 3 – a hybrid approach (SHEDS with modeled AER). Additional analyses were also performed to investigate whether there were differences in the risk of a MI associated with increased ambient PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> concentration for communities with high, medium, and low AERs, and whether the PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> health effects were modified when the mass fractions of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) on that day were high versus low.</Para>

              <Para>Exposure metric characteristics in Atlanta confirmed previously reported findings of greater spatiotemporal variability in traffic-related pollutants (i.e., CO, NO<Subscript>x</Subscript>, and EC) compared to secondary pollutants (i.e., O<Subscript>3</Subscript> and SO<Subscript>4</Subscript>) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00115">5</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00116">6</CitationRef>]. Distributions of modeled exposure estimates were found to differ from modeled ambient air pollutant concentrations due to either the influence of infiltration factors or varying times spent in non-ambient microenvironments. Specifically, the PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> exposures were lower than the ambient levels, while the NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> and CO exposures were greater than ambient values mainly, due to the influence of local traffic sources. In comparison to the use of central site monitoring data, we found greater estimated effects on respiratory disease and asthma/wheeze ED visits for the traffic-related pollutants when using the spatiotemporally-refined hybrid and APEX/SHEDS exposure metrics. However, we did not observe similar results for secondary pollutants. These results suggest that the modeled exposure metrics for traffic-related pollutants captured patterns of spatiotemporal variability in air pollution that were not reflected by measurements from the central site. On the other hand, these findings did not hold for cardiovascular disease ED visits, for which observed associations were similar among the various exposure metrics for each pollutant. We did not detect any significant associations in the ICD study.</Para>
              <Para>In both of the New Jersey epidemiological studies, consistent results were obtained across all four exposure surrogates. Namely, the use of refined exposure surrogates did not lead to a change in the predicted risk of MI or “small for gestational age” over that predicted by the central site PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> measurements (i.e., added explanatory power). In an alternative MI analysis, the use of air exchange rate was found to be an effect modifier of the PM2.5/MI association. Namely, we found that each interquartile range (10.8 μg/m<Superscript>3</Superscript>) increase in PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> concentration was associated with a significant 15 % increase in the relative odds of MI for subjects living in zip codes within the medium or high air exchange rate tertile, compared to subjects living in zip codes within the low air exchange rate tertile [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00117">7</CitationRef>]. Also, acute effects of ambient PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> on MI were greatest on days with a larger fraction of secondary PM (sulfate, nitrate and/or secondary OC), using based on bias corrected CMAQ model PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> species predictions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00117">7</CitationRef>].</Para>

              <Para>Our results indicate that the type of an epidemiologic study design and the level of detail of available health data can influence the spatio-temporal resolution needs of exposure information used for health effects research. Observed benefits of refined exposure estimates depend on the study design (time-series vs. cohort), health outcome (long vs. short), and spatial and temporal patterns of the pollutant. However, neither a case-crossover study nor a study that involves mid-term (e.g., trimester-long) averages of exposures is an optimal design for detecting whether refined exposure estimates add a significant amount of information beyond the central site monitor mainly due to their design. Epidemiologic study designs most likely to benefit from the use of refined exposure surrogates include those that have individual and/or household level data. We found in general that for time-series studies (e.g., MI or ED studies) ambient concentrations may serve as an appropriate exposure surrogate. However, for cohort studies or better spatio-temporally resolved acute studies (as shown in the Atlanta analysis) the use of more refined exposure surrogates than the conventionally used ambient monitoring data may boost study power, reduce exposure prediction errors, and strengthen the estimated associations between air pollution and health data. We also found that for spatially heterogeneous urban pollutants like CO and NO<Subscript>x</Subscript>, the associations of asthma ED visits with model-based exposure estimates were higher and more statistically significant than those with central site-based exposure estimates. However, for spatially homogenous pollutants, spatiotemporal models may add little to explaining variability as we found for O<Subscript>3</Subscript> in Atlanta. Clearly, it is important to better understand the different sources and factors influencing uncertainties in ambient pollution epidemiology analyses. It is possible that potential compounding errors or uncertainties in exposure model specification could introduce additional errors during the epidemiologic analyses when using modeled exposure metrics. We anticipate that the results of this research will improve exposure assessments in future air pollution epidemiology studies and help identify situations that might require refined exposure metrics. Overall, these new approaches will help to reduce uncertainty in health risk assessments of ambient air pollution and consequently the effectiveness of federal and state/local air quality management strategies.</Para>

                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: Based on your results, would you consider higher spatial or higher temporal resolution more beneficial to exposure assessment?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: This is a very good but complex question to respond. Typically, improved understanding of within vs. between individual variations in exposures is critical for conducting better exposure and health risk assessments, as well as, formulating optimum risk management strategies for many pollutants of health concern. Either higher temporal or spatial resolution can be important, depending on the context how individual or population level exposure information will be used in subsequent analysis. For instance, in predicting exposures to pollutants with short-term or acute health effects concerns (e.g., supporting epidemiological time-series or case-crossover studies on acute mortality or morbidity effects of air pollution, longitudinal panel studies on limited number of subjects) higher temporal resolution is often more desirable. However, for predicting exposures to pollutants with long-term or chronic health effects implications (e.g., supporting epidemiological cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, spatially resolved health data sets used in daily time-series studies) higher spatial resolution is often more desirable.</SimplePara>
