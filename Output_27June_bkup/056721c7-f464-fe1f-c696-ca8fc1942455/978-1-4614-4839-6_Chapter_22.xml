              <Para TextBreak="No">Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and <Emphasis Type="Italic">determinants</Emphasis> of diseases and injuries in human populations (Houghton Miffline Company, 2011). Disease does not develop randomly, and all individuals are not equally likely to develop a specific disease at a given time. The risk of developing a disease is therefore different for each individual and, isotypically, a function of his or her personal characteristics (inheritance) and their surroundings (environment). Epidemiology is often used in the occupational setting to determine causation (and hence financial responsibility), or to direct prevention programs. The epidemiological literature on occupational disorders is often confusing because of conflicting evidence on the importance of various potential risk factors. This chapter describes basic epidemiologic methods so the reader can learn to evaluate and critically analyze the published literature on occupational disorders.</Para>

              <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Epidemiology requires a methodology for testing scientific hypotheses in groups of individuals. Indeed, with the understanding the fundamental strengths and limitations of the design, combined with the implementation of published studies, it is possible to evaluate the strength of the evidence derived from these studies, and even to make sense of conflicting results from different studies on the same issue. Thus, we present an overview of the basic terminology used in epidemiology and the characteristics, strengths, and limitations of analytic (hypothesis testing) study designs, with an emphasis on observational study designs. At the outset, it should be noted that the two most common types of epidemiologic studies are: descriptive epidemiology is the most common type and is used to monitor the health of a population, identifying health problems, and compiling information that can be used to develop causal hypotheses. Analytic epidemiology is designed to test specific a hypotheses.</Para>

            <Section1 ID="Sec00222">
              <Heading>Why Is Determining Causation Important?</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In the occupational setting, causation analysis is most often used to determine legal and, hence, financial responsibility for the health condition. Causality assessment can also be used to develop prevention programs to: reduce the risk of disease or injury occurrence; establish eligibility for Social Security, welfare, or other entitlement programs; and to develop reasonable stay at work or return to work guides. To elaborate on the former, a causal determination in workers’ compensation is typically based on physician opinion, and used to decide whether or not employers or their insurers are legally responsible for the costs of evaluation and treatment of the health condition in question, as well as any disability and/or impairment resulting therefrom. In the United States, workers’ compensation is not a single system, but is a conglomerate of systems created by each State and Territory, in addition to federal statutes covering longshore and harbor workers, railroad employees, federal and postal workers, etc. The threshold for legal causation differs from one workers’ compensation system to another, and from tort or liability cases, both of which may be quite different from the criteria for scientific-medical causation. This lack of uniformity injects additional complexities into occupational causation analysis, which has both a medical and legal component. A well-informed physician opinion on causality requires knowledge of the applicable medical literature on causation of the condition in question, legal criteria for causation in the applicable jurisdiction, and facts of the specific case.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Before workers’ compensation statutes, suing the employer was the only legal means for a worker or the family to obtain compensation for an occupational injury or illness. Workers had to prove the employer’s negligence to be compensated, a hurdle that often could not be overcome due to three common law defenses: contributory negligence; fellow servant rule; and assumption of risk. These defenses, which often resulted in denial of recovery to injured or ill workers by nineteenth century courts, became known as the “three wicked sisters.” On the other hand, employers’ potential liability was not limited to healthcare costs, wage loss, and permanent impairments, but also included compensatory damages (e.g., pain and suffering, and punitive). Additionally, both parties had to undergo a time consuming and costly trial to determine liability and damages. Consequently, legislators passed workers’ compensation statutes as a compromise, ensuring that employees injured or made ill on the job received compensation in a timely manner, without need to prove negligence. Employers benefited via the preclusion of compensatory and punitive damages, thereby limiting their risk. Both parties and the courts were spared the temporal and financial costs of litigation.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Evidence-based medicine has become the standard for determining appropriate medical care. The most common definition was provided by Dr. David Sackett: “Evidence-based medicine is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients… [which] means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research” (Sackett, Rosenberg, Gray, Haynes, &amp; Richardson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00223">1996</CitationRef>). Unfortunately, randomized controlled clinical studies are difficult to perform in the workplace and, hence, are uncommon. Therefore, most of the information available is from epidemiologic studies which can disprove, but not prove, an association (Hadler, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00224">1999</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Epidemiology</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">As noted earlier, epidemiology focuses on the distribution and determinants of disease in groups of individuals who happen to have some characteristics, exposures, or diseases in common. Viewed as the study of the distribution and societal determinants of the health status of populations, epidemiology is the basic science foundation of public health (Melhorn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00225">1999</CitationRef>). The goal of epidemiologic studies is to identify factors associated (positively or negatively) with the development or recurrence of adverse medical conditions. A search strategy of bibliographic databases was used to identify epidemiologic literature that addresses causation of specific medical conditions as outlined in <Emphasis Type="Italic">Guides to the Evaluation of Disease and Injury Causation</Emphasis> (Melhorn &amp; Hegmann, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00226">2008</CitationRef>, Chapter 4: Methodology). Although the referenced Chap 4 is copyrighted, Drs. Melhorn and Hegmann have decided to offer the materials therein as “in the public domain and may be freely copied or reprinted” if appropriate acknowledgment of the reference source is used.</Para>

                      <Para TextBreak="No">Exacerbation is defined as: A transient worsening of a prior condition by an injury or illness, with the expectation that the situation will eventually return to baseline or pre-worsening level (Talmage &amp; Melhorn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002211">2005</CitationRef>). Some take issue with this definition because the signs or symptoms of a preexisting injury or illness may be temporarily worsened by something (i.e., activity, exposure, weather, reinjury), but the “something” is not an injury or illness. For example, a set of tennis will temporarily worsen the symptoms of degenerative arthritis in the serving shoulder, but tennis is neither an injury nor illness.

              <Para TextBreak="No">Epistemology (E·pis·te·mol·o·gy) [ih-pis-tuh-mol-uh-jee] is a branch of philosophy that investigates the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human knowledge. In other words “What We Know And How We Know It” or “What There Is to Know About Knowing” (Melhorn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002213">2008</CitationRef>). Therefore, as is often the case, a decision on causation may be difficult because the determination is based on imperfect or inadequate information. This chapter is designed to address causation analysis while acknowledging these intrinsic limitations. Limiting causal conclusions to proven and established facts does not guarantee that future studies will not prove the current data wrong. Conversely, shunning everything unproven will result in rejection of many statements that are true but just not proven.

                <Para TextBreak="No">Healthcare providers are often asked whether a condition is work-related or not (i.e., if it is causally related to a specific occupational injury or exposure). It is incumbent upon the clinician to give an opinion based on a careful review and analysis of: the individual’s clinical findings; his or her workplace exposures; the literature linking (or not) the injury or exposure of concern and the condition in question (Melhorn &amp; Ackerman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00222">2008</CitationRef>). In contrast to a witnessed occupational injury causing immediate symptoms and corroborated by objective physical and diagnostic test findings, a cause-and-effect relationship between the disease (nontraumatic injuries are classified by OSHA as illnesses) and an agent or condition in the workplace, may be unclear. Occupational diseases may develop slowly, with months or years between exposure and onset of symptoms and/or signs. Disease manifestations may be confused with changes due to normal aging. Information on past work exposure is often unavailable, inadequate, or incomplete. In addition, not all individuals react or respond in the same way to similar exposures to disease-producing agents. In some cases, there is a clearly identifiable single cause for the condition, whether work-related or nonoccupational. More often, causation is multifactorial, with one or more nonoccupational cause(s) (e.g., age-related degeneration, smoking, or obesity), in addition to varying contribution from the workplace.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Causality determination may be difficult and result in contested claims. Honest differences of opinion are common when the facts are subject to different interpretations. Therefore, considerable judgment is necessary when data are lacking or incomplete. With occupational diseases, what appears obvious to some may nevertheless still be controversial, and it is important to: assemble a complete a database (history including occupational and nonoccupational exposures, physical and test findings, healthcare records, etc.); be familiar with the relevant medical literature; and then review and analyze the data in a logical and unbiased manner to ensure a correct and equitable decision on causation.

                <Heading>Consideration of Epidemiological Data</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The essential approach of epidemiology is the investigation of relative and absolute measures of frequency, while comparing the characteristics of individuals with and without the condition. The most obvious measures of frequency are case counts and their variations, which are often referred to as <Emphasis Type="Italic">numerator data</Emphasis>. This number, the (numerator) describes the frequency of the disorder, without reference to the underlying population at risk (the <Emphasis Type="Italic">dominator</Emphasis> data). The United States Congress recognized that statistics on workplace injuries and diseases were essential to an effective national program of occupational disease prevention (Melhorn &amp; Ackerman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00222">2008</CitationRef>). Therefore, when the OSHA was passed in 1970, employers were required to maintain records on workplace injuries and illnesses (commonly labeled as OSHA 300 Logs). The Act delegated the responsibility for collecting statistics on these occupational injuries and illnesses to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). To comply with the OSHA, the BLS conducts an annual survey of the occupational injuries and illnesses in the United States (U.S. Department of Labor, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002216">2006b</CitationRef>). The survey compiles the OSHA 300 logs from over 200,000 establishments, grouped together by industry codes established by BLS as the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) (<ExternalRef>
                    <RefSource>http://www.bls.gov/bls/naics.htm</RefSource>
                    <RefTarget Address="http://www.bls.gov/bls/naics.htm" TargetType="URL"/>
                  </ExternalRef>). The frequency of the particular disorder can also be expressed as a proportionate ratio. The number of cases of the particular disorder, compared to cases of all disorders, in the study population. By itself, <Emphasis Type="Italic">numerator data</Emphasis> cannot provide useful information regarding the risk or probability of acquiring the disorder. The case frequency has to be related to the underlying population that could have potentially developed the disorder (the <Emphasis Type="Italic">denominator</Emphasis>). Without the denominator (the number of people at risk), it is not possible to estimate the risk of a specific condition in the population, or to test hypotheses regarding risk factors for a specific condition.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">There are, though, known limitations of the BLS data. The survey estimates of occupational injuries and illnesses are based on a scientifically-selected probability sample, rather than a census of the entire population. Because the data are based on a sample survey, the injury and illness estimates probably differ from the figures that would be obtained from all units covered by the survey. Also, the survey measures the number of new work-related illness cases that are recognized, diagnosed, and reported during the year. Some conditions (e.g., long-term latent illnesses caused by exposure to carcinogens) often are difficult to relate to the workplace, and are not adequately recognized and reported. These long-term latent illnesses are believed to be understated in the survey’s illness measures. In contrast, the overwhelming majority of the reported new illnesses are those that are easier to track (e.g., contact dermatitis or carpal tunnel syndrome) (Melhorn &amp; Ackerman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00222">2008</CitationRef>). Furthermore, employer bias in selecting which conditions to report may result in under-reporting. Additionally, the OSHA definition for work-relatedness is more inclusive than most. Injuries and illnesses that occur at work may not have a clear connection to an occupational activity or substance peculiar to the work environment. For example, an employee may trip for no apparent reason while walking across a level factory floor, be sexually assaulted by a coworker, or be injured accidentally as a result of an act of violence perpetrated by one coworker against a third party. For this reason, rates are often used when the objective is to assess the risk of the disorder or determinants of disorders or their outcomes.</Para>

              <Section2 ID="Sec002211">
                <Heading>Rates</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Rates describe the frequency of a disorder (or disorder per unit size of the population per unit time of observation). The most common rates are <Emphasis Type="Italic">incidence</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">prevalence</Emphasis>. The incidence rate is based on new cases of a disorder, whereas the prevalence rate reflects existing cases. Because they are based on new versus existing cases, incidence and prevalence rates have different uses and limitations. Therefore, the incidence rate is a rate of change, often described as the frequency with which people change from healthy to injured, sick, or disabled. Thus, the appropriate denominator is the population at risk of acquiring the disorder (i.e., those who are free of the disorder at the start of the time interval). The incidence rate may be quantified in a number of ways when the population is stable and the number of new events is counted each year. This is often expressed as the number of new events per 1,000 persons per year. Alternatively, incidence rate may be quantified as the number of new events per 1,000 person-years, as is done in prospective studies where a fixed population is followed until the end of the study. In practice, although the best denominator for incidence rates is the number of people free of the disorder at the start of the time interval, surveillance incidence rates (and prevalence rates) that are based on case reports often use the total population derived from estimates or census data.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The prevalence rate is the number of existing cases of a disorder in a given population in a given time period, while <Emphasis Type="Italic">point prevalence</Emphasis> is the number of cases per unit population at one moment. For example, point prevalence would be the number of railroad employees receiving disability because of a medical condition on a specific day such as January 1, 2010. Therefore, the unit of time is not expressed. A <Emphasis Type="Italic">period prevalence</Emphasis> would be the number of cases existing at one time during a definable time interval such as 1-year. Lifetime prevalence (which is a form of period prevalence) is defined as the number of individuals in a population that, at some point in their life which could be several to more than 100 years, have the condition in question, compared to the total number of persons. Prevalence is sometimes not defined as a rate because, in practice, data are often derived from surveys that are difficult to assign to a specific time interval. A number of variables, other than the risk factor under study, may affect the incidence and prevalence rates. Examples include demographic characteristics of the underlying population. The most common variable is age distribution because aging is associated with the onset of most disorders. Gender and ethnicity distributions must also be taken into account. Other confounders that can distort the incidence rate include company policies, workers’ compensation claims, and health care system influences that affect the likelihood of seeking medical attention, of being diagnosed with a given disorder, or of having the disorder reported. These variables must be considered when measures of disorder frequency are evaluated, particularly when changes are assessed over time or when different populations are compared. In order to eliminate the effects of differences in these variables, the rates may be adjusted or standardized algebraically. The adjusted rates express the risk of acquiring the disorder in the populations being compared as if they had the same age, sex, and ethnicity distributions. In other words, the “variables” have been accounted for. Sometimes, it is appropriate to not account for these variables (e.g., the morbidity rates within population strata defined by age, sex, and ethnicity). Remember, the number of existing cases of a disorder at any time is a function of both the rate of new cases (incidence) and the duration of that disorder. Accordingly, a change in prevalence may reflect changes in the incidence rate, duration, or both. Consequently, when a population is stable and the duration of a disorder is also stable, it is possible to estimate prevalence from incidence and vice versa, according to the following approximation:

              <Para TextBreak="No">Each epidemiologic study also has certain basic elements: occurrence relation, outcome, determinant(s), study population, and domain. Determinant(s) are defined as the risk factors related to the diagnosis. The study population must be well defined to allow the data obtained to be applied, or theoretically generalized, to a larger population called the domain. This requirement is often described as <Emphasis Type="Italic">external validity</Emphasis>.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Specific hypotheses are developed by inductive reasoning to explain observed patterns of variation, and then evaluated using a study designed to test them. Studies that test specific hypotheses are <Emphasis Type="Italic">analytic epidemiologic</Emphasis> studies (the second major type of epidemiologic study). As the results of hypothesis testing (analytic) studies are accrued, and their data added to the basis for causal inference, depending on their strengths and generalizability, and hypotheses are supported, modified, or negated. Analytic (hypothesis testing) epidemiology relies on two types of study designs: Observational and experimental. In observational studies, exposure to the hypothesized causal factor and the subsequence development of the selected disorder in the population under study occur in the natural course of events; in other words, the investigator does not cause the exposure to the causal factor. The study is designed and implemented to maximize the extent to which it is a natural experiment. Extraneous sources of variation are eliminated, and only exposure to the alleged cause and the frequency of the selected disorder vary between populations being compared. Once substantial observational evidence has accrued, causality is often widely accepted. However, only prospective randomized interventional or experimental studies can prove causation; and these are unlikely to be performed in the workplace as it would require exposing individuals to known or suspected risk factors and, thereby, potential harm.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Epidemiological versus individual causal assessment requires determination that a “risk factor” is truly a disease determinant, rather than merely an associated factor (Hegmann &amp; Oostema, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002215">2008</CitationRef>). If the risk factor is causal, then elimination of the risk factor must result in fewer cases of the particular disease. Literature review summaries require five steps, as listed in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00223">22.3</InternalRef>. To summarize, one must try to avoid omitting articles in the review of the literature. Of course, the purpose of a well-designed study is to provide insight into the “truth” regarding causation. The ability to determine the truth, or to infer from a limited sample to the whole, is compromised by a systematic or study design flaw in the form of bias and/or confounding. Alternatively, chance or random occurrence may influence whether the results of a study accurately reflect the truth. Etiologic epidemiology tests whether a hypothesized factor is a determinant or cause of disorder in previously healthy population whereas, in clinical epidemiology, one tests whether risk factors are determinants of the specific disease. The classic observational analytic study designs are the cohort study, the case–control study, and the cross-sectional study.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00223">

                <Para TextBreak="No">Because it is not possible to study the entire universe of potentially eligible subjects (workers), epidemiologic studies are conducted on samples of the population of interest. Even a study of an entire city’s work force constitutes a sample. The method of sampling should not introduce selection biases, but epidemiological studies are commonly affected by them. For example, no characteristics of the individuals should affect the likelihood of selection for the study; but a volunteer study is potentially susceptible to selection bias because the health behavior and health status of people who volunteer for research are known to be better than those who refuse.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Internal validity</Emphasis> refers to both how well a scientific study was conducted, and how confidently one can conclude there is a cause-and-effect relationship. Research design, definitions used, what variables were and were not measured, how accurately they were measured, completeness of data collection, and other factors all influence validity. This applies to both descriptive and experimental studies. However, in experimental studies, one also wants to know how certain is it that the effect was caused by the independent variable rather than extraneous ones. For example, did the treatment really cause or contribute to the difference observed between subjects in the control and experimental groups? If there is inaccuracy (measurement error) in the information collected, the ability to detect the association of interest is reduced. If the accuracy of information is worse for one exposure group than another, the effect on the study results may not be predictable. Hence, evaluation of the accuracy (or validity) of measurements is necessary for any study. Research reports should describe the validity of the sources of information. For example, questionnaires or reporting methods that have been validated in the study population, or in similar populations or circumstances, should be used.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Finally, the strength of evidence regarding etiology varies depending on the type of study. Prospective cohort studies are best, while retrospective cohort studies are of low-medium strength, and case–control and cross-sectional low strength.

The direction of data inquiry can be seen in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00223">22.3</InternalRef>. When well designed and executed, a cohort study produces the soundest results for incidence rates, disorder etiology, and/or prognostic determinants of all the observational study designs. The hallmark of a cohort study is that a population is initially free of the disease of interest. Potential confounders and important covariates are identified and characterized with respect to the hypothesized risk factor. The population is observed for a period of time adequate for development of the disorder, and the new (incident) cases are recorded. Rates of disorder development are compared between those who are and are not exposed to the hypothesized risk factor. Loss to follow-up, though, is a potential problem. If a number of individuals are lost to follow-up, the observed relative risk underestimates the true relative risk. Selective survival or selective attrition bias can occur. Long latency periods increase the cost to continue these studies.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00223">

                  <Para TextBreak="No">The essential feature of the case–control study that differentiates it from other observational study types is that individuals are selected for the study based on the presence of the disorder in question (cases) and compared with others who do not have the disorder (control subjects). The presence or absence of the hypothesized cause is then ascertained in both case and control subjects. Although this appears to be a simple undertaking, case–control studies present a number of methodological challenges that must be solved for the study results to be valid. Case–control studies frequently suffer from information biases and unbiased recall failure.</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">Cross-sectional studies simultaneously ascertain exposure to risk factors and the presence of the disorder in question in a population sampled without regard to the presence of either. This type of sampling is sometimes called naturalistic sampling. In contrast to a cohort study, which follows subjects over time and ascertains incidence, a cross-sectional study ascertains conditions present at the moment of study, that is, prevalence of the disorder. The estimates of relative risk derived from cross-sectional studies are therefore estimates of prevalence relative risk. Cross-sectional or survey studies are often undertaken because, unlike case–control studies, they require few a priori decisions regarding subject selection and, unlike cohort studies, it is not necessary to wait for the study outcome. These advantages are offset by their susceptibility to some of the problems of both cohort and case–control studies listed above, and resultant decreased strength of evidence.</Para>

Measurements made during research are nearly always subject to random variation. Determining whether findings are due to chance is a key feature of statistical analysis. The best way to avoid error due to random variation is to ensure that sample size is adequate (O’Keefe, Huffman, &amp; Bukata, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002217">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">confidence interval</Emphasis> is a plus-or-minus figure, and is often reported as the margin of error. For example, with a confidence interval of 5, if 40 % of a sample picks an answer, one can be reasonably certain that between 35 and 45 % (40  ±  5) of the entire study population would have selected the same answer if asked that question. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">confidence level</Emphasis> is the statistical likelihood that a variable lies within the confidence interval, expressed as a percentage, such as, 50, 95, or 99 %. It measures the reliability of a statistical result, and indicates the probability the result is correct. The 95 % confidence level is most commonly used. The sample size required depends on the confidence and confidence level (Creative Research Systems, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002218">2011</CitationRef>). For a given confidence level, the larger the sample size, the smaller your confidence interval, and the more certain one can be that the results truly reflect the entire population.

                <Para TextBreak="No">This is similar to bias and is often confused. Bias involves error in the measurement of a variable, whereas confounding involves error in the interpretation of what may be an accurate measurement. A classic example of confounding is to interpret the finding that people who carry matches are more likely to develop lung cancer as a cause-and-effect relationship. Smoking is the confounder. Smokers are more likely to carry matches and also more likely to develop lung cancer. Confounding occurs when the study results can be explained by a factor unnecessary to the hypothesis being tested. A potential confounding factor must be associated with both the disorder in question and the hypothesized cause. That is to say, the study group with the disorder having the confounding exposure must be different from the study group without the disorder but also have the confounding exposure. Additionally, it is necessary that the study group of those with the hypothesized cause and confounding exposure are different from the group not exposed to the hypothesized cause but have the confounding factor. For example, a study finding an association between low job satisfaction and occupational carpal tunnel syndrome could be confounded by the physical requirements of work. Specifically, those individuals whose work involves repetitive high force activities in a cold environment are at greater risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome, but this group also has a lower job satisfaction than individuals employed in less physically demanding occupations. So, which factor is actually responsible for the risk of occupational carpal tunnel syndrome? Potential confounding factors can be eliminated in the design of the study by restricted or matched sampling or, in the data analysis phase, by stratified or multivariate analysis, for example. In the study just described, if statistical analyses controlled for the physical requirements of work, or if the researchers conducted an exploratory analysis and found no association between job satisfaction and the physical requirements of work, the confounding could be reduced or eliminated. In experimental studies, potential confounding should be eliminated by truly random assignment of individuals to the treatment and control groups. Comparability of the groups should be confirmed by presentation of the baseline characteristics of each group upon entry to the study. Thus, confounding invalidates a study as a test of the null hypothesis, and its results cannot be taken as evidence of causality. Lack of generalizability, unlike confounding, does not invalidate a study’s results, but merely restricts inference to populations similar to those under study.</Para>

For example, the relationship between diet and coronary heart disease may be explained by serum cholesterol level. Elevated cholesterol is not a confounder because it may be the causal link between diet and coronary heart disease.

Therefore, the results of such studies are estimates of the true means, proportions, relative risks, etc. of the populations from which the sample groups were selected. The precision of a study estimate of the population value is described by the <Emphasis Type="Italic">standard error of estimate</Emphasis>. The standard error (SE) is the square root of the ratio of the variance (<Emphasis Type="Italic">s</Emphasis>
                  <Superscript>2</Superscript>), or variability of the measurement in the sample, to the number of subjects (<Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis>) in the study, as expressed by the formula <InlineEquation ID="IEq00221">

                <Para TextBreak="No">The statistical hypothesis test evaluates the null hypothesis: The study results observed occurred because of sampling error when there was no true association in the population from which the sample of study subjects was derived. If the observed association is large enough that this kind of error is improbable, the null hypothesis is rejected. The investigators then accept the alternative hypothesis, that the observed estimates of relative risk or association reflect the true situation in the sampled population. By convention, the cutoff for rejecting the null hypothesis is usually set at 0.05. Thus, if the probability (<Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis> value) that the observed results are due to sampling error is &lt;0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected. The results are declared statistically significant because within an acceptable margin of error, they probably did not occur by chance. The larger the observed association, relative to the underlying variability of the outcome being measured, the more likely it will be statistically significant.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A <Emphasis Type="Italic">Type I error</Emphasis>, also known as a false positive, occurs when a statistical hypothesis test rejects the null hypothesis, even though it is true. For example, the null hypothesis states a new treatment is no better than an older, less expensive one. A Type I error would occur if researchers concluded the new treatment produced outcomes when in reality there was no difference. The rate of Type I errors is represented by the Greek letter alpha (<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis>), and usually equals the significance level of a test. Relatedly, a Type II error, also known as a false negative, occurs when a statistical hypothesis test fails to reject a false null hypothesis. Continuing the prior example, a Type II error would occur if researchers concluded that there was no difference in outcomes between the new and old treatments when, in fact, the new treatment was more effective. False negative results are often due to too small sample sizes. The rate of Type II error is represented by the Greek letter beta (<Emphasis Type="Italic">β</Emphasis>).</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">In the planning phase of research, investigators should determine how strong an association (how large an estimated relative risk or how big a difference between treatments) would be statistically significant. Because a valid study requires that it be a true test of the research hypothesis, it is important to design it so the study has sufficient statistically power to detect a statistically significant association. The larger the sample size, the more power the statistical test has to detect associations. In other words, as expected differences or relative risks get smaller, the number of subjects studied must increase to have adequate statistically power to test the hypothesis. With very large sample sizes, it is possible to declare trivial associations statistically significant. When studies with small sample sizes report results that are not statistically significant, they should also report how large an association would have been required to detect it. One should also evaluate whether the observed difference and its upper confidence limit, although not statistically significant, are clinically significant. Conversely, when studies with large numbers of subjects report statistically significant results, then one needs to determine if the differences are clinically significant or not.</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">An <Emphasis Type="Italic">independent variable</Emphasis> is one whose value determines that of other variables. A <Emphasis Type="Italic">dependent variable</Emphasis> is that which is observed in a study, and whose changes are determined by the presence and extent of one or more independent variables. A <Emphasis Type="Italic">continuous variable</Emphasis> describes numerical information that can be any value within a range. Continuous data may be <Emphasis Type="Italic">parametric</Emphasis> or <Emphasis Type="Italic">nonparametric</Emphasis>. Parametric data may be represented in a distribution explained by a single mathematical equation. Nonparametric data are not represented by a single mathematical equation, and does not belong to any particular distribution. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Relative risk</Emphasis> (RR) estimates the magnitude of the association between the exposure and disease of interest. RR equals the incidence of disease in exposed subjects divided by that in unexposed individuals. A RR of 1.0 means the disease incidence rates are identical in the exposed and unexposed study groups. A RR &gt;1.0 suggests a positive association (increased incidence in exposed group), while a RR of &lt;1.0 suggests a negative or inverse association (decreased incidence in the exposed study group). Finally an <Emphasis Type="Italic">odds ratio</Emphasis> (OR) is used in retrospective case–control studies where incidence cannot be determined.

              <Para TextBreak="No">How does the evaluator take the general epidemiological data and apply this information to the specifics of the individual in question regarding causation? Occasionally, occupational data will be presented for each relevant job or duty. The following information would be helpful: the identification of risk factor(s); and data from industrial hygiene studies, especially any that indicates the magnitude of worker exposure. With regard to occupational disease, there is no generally accepted medical definition of <Emphasis Type="Italic">aggravation</Emphasis>. However, for workers’ compensation, aggravation of a disease or impairment may be defined as any occupational occurrence, act, or exposure that permanently worsens, intensifies, or increases the severity of any preexisting physical or mental problem. The existence of a condition before exposure does not necessarily mean before employment. Furthermore, an individual may experience multiple exposures, while working for different employers having different workers’ compensation insurance carriers. An example may be helpful.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A 35 year old man has worked as a chain saw logger for the past 15 years, and complains of a 10 year history of numbness in both hands and digits. History, physical examination, and nerve conduction study by a physician reveal bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. A judge decided his condition was compensable under the current state’s workers’ compensation system and asked for an apportionment of the medical condition. During his 15 years of employment, he has worked for three different companies. The last employer changed insurance carriers 1 month before he filed the workers’ compensation claim.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec002222">
                <Heading>Apportionment</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Workers’ compensation boards in all jurisdictions are faced with an expanding challenge in the management of occupational disease claims. In some cases, there are multiple risk factors, with multifactorial causation, and the resultant need to clarify the contribution of each risk factor to the condition in question in order to apportion liability and financial costs. The process of adjudicating workers’ compensation claims depends on the applicable statue, but may involve differentiation between occupational and nonoccupational causes of disease and injury. Although, in practice, this can be exceedingly difficult and, in some cases, impossible, establishing causation and <Emphasis Type="Italic">apportionment</Emphasis> are integral parts of the philosophy of workers’ compensation. Apportionment by cause is the estimation in an individual case of the relative contribution of several risk factors or potential causal exposures to the disease. In the tort system, the equivalent concept is apportionment of harm (meaning responsibility for causing harm). However, because workers’ compensation is a no-fault insurance system, assignment of blame or responsibility is generally irrelevant.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Apportionment by cause must be performed on the individual case, which may vary from the population as a whole. However, often apportionment cannot be determined with certainty, and epidemiologic data may then be used to derive an estimate of the relative contribution of risk factors in an individual claim. The estimate for apportionment of causation derived should not to be confused with the apportionment of its social derivative, disability. The benefits of fair and accurate apportionment, when it can be done, are obvious. Adjudication may be simpler, quicker, cheaper, and fairer to injured workers, employers, and insurers. Workers might be encouraged to take responsibility for their own health. The financial resources conserved could be used to increase benefits and/or decrease premium costs. Fiscal exposure for healthcare, disability, and impairment would be more fairly divided among payers, such as provincial or private healthcare plans, Social Security, or workers’ compensation.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Although apportionment is an attractive option for adjudication in workers’ compensation, it has many drawbacks and uncertainties (Melhorn, Andersson, &amp; Mandell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002219">2001</CitationRef>). The single greatest obstacle to apportionment is the availability of data and limitations on the methodology of assessment of relative contribution to the disease. Therefore, apportionment is often consensus- or expert-derived. Workers’ compensation carriers are generally required to accept medical claims in their totality if a component of the disease is work-related. However, there is a wide variation between jurisdictions regarding how big the occupational component must be before the condition is accepted as work-related. A minimal contribution from work, even one iota, is sufficient to render a disease compensable in some states, whereas others require that work have been the substantial factor, the major contributing cause, or a significant contributor. Furthermore, defining what constitutes a substantial, significant, or even minimal component is often difficult. Apportionment is more often applied to the permanent impairment rating which is often used to determine a financial settlement in workers’ compensation claims.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A special case of apportionment is <Emphasis Type="Italic">presumption</Emphasis>, of which there are two types. A <Emphasis Type="Italic">rebuttable presumption</Emphasis> shifts the burden of proof to the part against which the presumption applies (Melhorn, Ackerman, Glass, &amp; Deitz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002220">2008</CitationRef>). In law, it is an assumption by a court that is considered true until a preponderance of evidence disproves (rebuts) the presumption. For example, in criminal law a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty. On the other hand, an <Emphasis Type="Italic">irrebuttable presumption</Emphasis> establishes a legal conclusion which may be based, not on scientific or other evidence, but the desire for social justice and fair play (Melhorn et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002220">2008</CitationRef>). Judges and legislatures have the power to substitute convenience for science. For example, an irrebuttable presumption may be made based on information (not necessarily facts) that, because most cases of a disease in persons with a given job can be attributed to an occupational risk factor, any such case for which a claim is filed will be accepted as work-related. Many presumptions are written into law, often without good evidence, such as the presumption in California that heart disease among firefighters and police officers is work-related (Brooks &amp; Melhorn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002221">2008</CitationRef>). Others are “scheduled,” or designated on lists. Presumption logically requires both strong evidence of an association and a risk that is at least doubled. A simple association can be accepted at a &gt;50 % level of certainty for the occupational group overall at whatever degree of association, but a simple association is not the same as presumption. A presumption involves the same degree of certainty, but an actual proportion of the disease (attributable fraction) compatible with at least 50 % in the occupation or population overall. At such a high frequency, it is statistically likely that, for any one individual drawn from that population (and submitting a claim) who presents with the disease or outcome in question, the occupational cause would be the risk factor. For example, firefighters have a much higher risk of kidney cancer than the general population, but their risk of lung cancer is only elevated by about 50 % (Guidotti, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002222">2006</CitationRef>). One can justify a presumption for kidney cancer, but not for lung cancer. Any firefighter with kidney cancer probably would not have been at risk if he or she were not in that occupation.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Presumptions can also be legislated in the opposite fashion. For example, in 1996, the Virginia Supreme Court said that carpal tunnel syndrome does not make a person eligible for workers’ compensation benefits even if a doctor insists the problem is work-related (Carrico, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002223">1996</CitationRef>). The effects of increasing requests for apportionment are reflected in the definition use in the AMA <Emphasis Type="Italic">Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment</Emphasis>. The 4th edition, published in 1995, states apportionment is an estimate of the degree to which each of various occupational or nonoccupational factors may have caused or contributed to a particular impairment. For each alleged factor, two criteria must be met: the alleged factor could have caused or contributed to the impairment, which is a medical determination; and in the case in question, the factor did cause or contribute to the impairment, which usually is a nonmedical determination. The physician’s analysis and explanation of causation is significant. The 5th edition, published in 2001, defines apportionment as the distribution or allocation of causation among multiple factors that caused or significantly contributed to the injury or disease and existing impairment. The 6th edition, published in 2008, states apportionment is the extent to which each of two or more probable causes are found responsible for an effect (injury, disease, impairment, etc.). Only probable causes (at least more probable than not) are included. Hence, the first step in apportionment is scientifically-based causation analysis. Second, one must allocate responsibility among the probable causes and select apportionment percentages consistent with the medical literature and facts of the case in question. Arbitrary, merely opinion-based unscientific apportionment estimates which are nothing more than speculations, must be avoided. When appropriate, the current impairment can also be apportioned to more than one cause.</Para>

                <Heading>The Changing Threshold for Workers’ Compensation Compensability</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Kansas House Bill No. 2134, An Act Concerning Workers Compensation, passed May 15 2011 as Law 04-18-2011 (Kansas House, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002224">2011</CitationRef>) defines “Prevailing Factor Test” which, under this test, the employee’s work must be the “prevailing factor” for the injury to be considered work-compensable. If it is not the “prevailing factor,” the injury is not compensable. It is believed that, under this standard, employers will have a defense against preexisting degenerative conditions not “caused” by work. In other words, employees will no longer have a compensable claim for an aggravation, acceleration, or intensification of a preexisting condition. Unfortunately, the legislature did not define “prevailing factor” and did not reference the Missouri law which could then have been used as “case law” to assist in the definition. Consensus opinion is that the need to define “prevailing factor” will increase ligation and the associated costs.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The Missouri Workers’ Compensation Law was passed and is in Chapter 287 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri (<ExternalRef>

                  </ExternalRef>). The workers’ compensation statute is the law that controls the rights and obligations of employees and employers when employees are injured at work. It outlines that the work injury must be the “prevailing factor” in causing the level of disability and medical condition for it to be compensable. Medical causation is needed in cases where a traumatic incident occurred or where an employee is injured by an occupational exposure or repetitive motion that is part of their employment. The prevailing factor is the primary factor in comparison to any other possible factor resulting in the employee’s injury.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Nonprofessional persons cannot be expected to collect and evaluate all the information needed in causation analysis. In most cases, physicians will provide testimony on test results, medical conditions, and causation using information from industrial hygienists regarding exposure and epidemiologists regarding epidemiologic data. These professionals must consider all pertinent facts and literature in their area of expertise to present an accurate and meaningful evaluation of the available data. The judicial entity requesting the information or determination may have additional expert witness criteria, such as the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Daubert Standard</Emphasis>, to be discussed next. The law of evidence governs whether testimony (e.g., oral or written statements, such as an affidavit), exhibits (e.g., physical objects), and other documentary material are admissible (i.e., allowed to be considered by the trier of fact, whether a judge or jury) in a judicial or administrative proceeding (e.g., a court of law) and how they are used (Wikipedia, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002226">2011</CitationRef>). In 1993, the United States Supreme Court established the current standards for the admissibility of scientific evidence in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. This decision abolished the old “general acceptance” test and set forth a new standard which focuses on the reliability and relevance of scientific testimony. In evaluating scientific testimony, trial courts will consider the following factors: whether the research was conducted prior to the litigation; whether it has been tested; whether it had been subjected to peer review and publication; whether there is a known or potential rate of error; whether the research was conducted according to fixed standards; and whether the technique is generally accepted in the scientific community (Klimek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002227">2001</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The Daubert Standard is a rule of evidence regarding the admissibility of expert witness testimony during United States federal legal proceedings (Wikipedia, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002226">2011</CitationRef>). Pursuant to this standard, a party may raise a Daubert motion, which is a special case of motion in limine raised before or during trial to exclude the presentation of unqualified evidence to the jury. A motion in limine (Latin: “at the threshold”) is one made before the start of a trial requesting that the judge rule that certain evidence may, or may not, be introduced at trial. This is done in judge’s chambers, or in open court with the jury absent. Usually, it is used to shield the jury from evidence that may be inadmissible and/or unfairly prejudicial. Nonexpert witnesses are permitted to testify only about facts they observed and not their opinions about these facts. An expert (professional) witness is one who, by virtue of education, training, skill, or experience, has knowledge and expertise in a scientific, technical, or other subject beyond that of a layperson, sufficient that others may rely upon his or her opinion on evidence and facts within the expert’s area of expertise, even though he or she was not present at the time of the injury, exposure, or other event. In law and religion, testimony is a solemn attestation as to the truth of a matter, and the expert opinion is intended to educate the judge and/or jury on a specialized subject matter, thereby assisting the trier of fact.</Para>

                <Heading>Consideration of Other Relevant Factors</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Medical causation is drawn from science, while in-law causation is the connection between a wrongful act and harm (Melhorn et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002220">2008</CitationRef>). Work-relatedness, in the context of occupational injury or illness, involves concepts of both medical and legal causation. The two may be mutually exclusive. Definitions of medical causation and legal causation arise from different sources—one from science and the other from desire for social justice (with origins in religion). This has been described by Melhorn as “the difference between why things are as they are, and how things ought to be” (Melhorn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002213">2008</CitationRef>). For physicians treating injured or ill workers, understanding the differences between the two concepts is essential. Legal causation requires two components: cause in fact, and proximate (or “legal”) cause (Melhorn et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002220">2008</CitationRef>). Both must be present. If the occurrence of one event brings about another, the former can be considered the cause in fact of the latter. This is true regardless of the number of events involved. Causal fallacies exist, and at least one of them requires attention here. The “<Emphasis Type="Italic">post hoc ergo propter hoc</Emphasis>” fallacy occurs when “after this, therefore because of this” reasoning leads to the assertion of a causal relationship. It is a fallacy to conclude that the occurrence of one event followed by a second necessarily demonstrates a causal relationship between the two. The second part of the legal analysis of causation seeks to determine whether two events that are linked in fact should also be linked in law. This second test, proximate or legal cause, is whether the two events are so closely linked that liability should be attached or assigned to the first event that produced the harm, the second event. The most common legal threshold is “that the injury arises, in whole or in significant part, out of or in the course and scope of employment” (Melhorn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002228">2000</CitationRef>). The most common level of legal certainty needed to establish medical causation in the legal system is “more likely than not” or “more probable than not” (Melhorn, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002229">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">What is a causal relationship?: Inferring a causal relationship requires an understanding of epidemiology. Epidemiology is a science and, as such, adopts the scientific standard of proof, generally greater than or equal to 95 % probability. However, civil litigation and adjudication hold to a different standard. How does one apply epidemiology when the standard is “more likely than not?” In general, this requires a relative risk odds ratio of greater than 2.0. Unfortunately, there is often insufficient data to establish a relative risk. Furthermore, conventional statistics for risk derived from epidemiologic research are generalized and may be difficult to apply to an individual case since the individual’s experience in the future may not be similar to the group studied.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Health and medical knowledge are essential to the resolution of disputes in legal and administrative applications (such as workers’ compensation) and provide essential input into public policy decisions. There are no socially agreed-upon rules for the application of this knowledge except in the law. On a practical level, the legal system lacks the capacity to evaluate the validity of knowledge as evidence and therefore relies heavily on expert opinion.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The determination of causation may be extremely difficult in contested claims. Honest differences of opinion are common when the “facts” may be subject to different interpretations. The practitioner faced with the above questions should know the legal definitions that determine whether the condition is considered work-related. Although the condition may not meet the medical criteria of causation, the condition may meet the legal threshold and therefore be considered work-compensable. Considerable judgment is necessary when data are lacking or incomplete. It is important to assemble complete information in a logical and orderly sequence wherever possible to ensure a correct and an equitable decision regarding causation.</Para>
