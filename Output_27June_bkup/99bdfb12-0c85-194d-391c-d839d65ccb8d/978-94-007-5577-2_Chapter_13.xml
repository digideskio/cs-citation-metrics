              <Para>One of the measures that is promoted in order to improve the air quality is the decrease of vehicle mileage. However, there are different reasons to assume that not every kilometer driven by car yields the same impact on air pollution nor on the exposure of people. For instance, some trips are driven at high speeds on highways, while others are driven at relatively low speeds in urban environments. This will have an impact on the resulting emissions. Furthermore, emissions exhausted during the night will have a larger impact on the ground-level concentrations than emissions exhausted during the day, due to the higher atmospheric stability. And another aspect is that emissions produced in cities will affect a larger population than emissions in sparsely populated areas. These and other aspects are examined in this chapter. Analysis of the results per trip purpose shows that driving 1 km to work increases the pollutant concentrations about 1.3–1.4 times more than driving 1 km to go shopping, mainly due, but not confined to, the time of the day at which the activity is performed.</Para>

              <Para>The importance of source-related measures to reduce the environmental impact of transport is widely acknowledged. Unlike technological measures, source-related measures intervene at an earlier stage of the problem and are therefore considered to be a more efficient solution towards transport related air quality problems.</Para>

              <Para>In this chapter, an integrated model chain is applied to assess the environmental impact of trips with different trip purposes. More detailed information on the individual models, the applied coupling procedure and the validation analysis can be found in Lefebvre et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00131">1</CitationRef>]. The motives for every trip are defined by the activity performed at the trip destination. As a result, going to work (motive work) is assigned a different motive than going home (motive home).</Para>

              <Para>The emissions per trip motive (relative to an average passenger car) are presented in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00131">13.1</InternalRef> (blue bars). Higher emissions per driven kilometer are seen with the heavy duty vehicles, compared to the passenger cars. This is as expected due to their high fuel consumption per kilometer. Comparing different trip motives driven by cars, we see a difference between them. For instance, trips for shopping and services have lower emission values per kilometer than for transit trips. This is closely correlated to the highway use of transit traffic and the almost complete lack of highway use for shopping and services. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00131">

              <Para>The concentration changes per exhausted emission reflect the marginal impact of an exhaust emission on the resulting concentration. Comparing the concentrations per emission value (calculated by dividing the total concentration change per motive by the total emissions change per motive), we see some differences between the different motives (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00131">13.1</InternalRef>, red bars (relative to an average passenger car)). In contrast to the emission results, where the road type used appeared to be an important factor, the concentration changes are influenced by the moment in the daily cycle when the emissions are exhausted. For example, the trip motive ‘going to work’ is generally done in the early morning, when the dispersion is very limited. As a result, an emission produced during a trip to work usually results in larger concentration increases than an emission produced when going home. Shopping, services, social activities and touring are activities that generally take place during the day or in the early evening. As a result, trips with these trip motives occur on average at moments with good dispersion conditions, leading to smaller concentration increases.</Para>

              <Para>In this chapter, exposure is defined as a simple passive exposure, based on residential address information. More specific exposure aspects like indoor exposure and dynamic exposure are not assessed. The added value of the exposure assessment lies in the high resolution (up to 5 m) habitation data used in this study.</Para>
              <Para>In fact, as there is more traffic in densely populated areas than in non-densely populated areas, the static exposure (i.e. the sum of the multiplication of each person with the corresponding concentration value) will be higher than the multiplication of the regional averaged concentration with the total population. We call the proportion of both factors the population multiplication factor (PMF) and define it thus as follows:</Para>

              <Para>As expected, this factor is above 1 for all motives, ranging from 1.75 to 2.55. Indeed, for all motives, more traffic is generated in densely populated areas than in sparsely populated areas. Furthermore, results show that motives which have a larger fraction of highway use have a lower PMF than those which do not have such an abundant highway use (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00131">13.1</InternalRef>, green bars (relative to an average passenger car)). However, the correlation is small, as highways regularly cross densely populated areas in Flanders. The exception is the transit traffic, which has a high highway use fraction but also the highest PMF of all motives. This is due to the specific distribution of the transit fraction over the region.</Para>

              <Para>The exposure per kilometer driven will be given by the multiplication of the emission per km driven, the concentration per emission and the exposure increase per concentration. We call the exposure per kilometer driven the exposure intensity (EI). As expected, heavy duty vehicles have a much higher EI than cars, but the EI is not so high as could be expected when comparing their respective emission per kilometer (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00131">13.1</InternalRef>, dark yellow bars). This is due to the low PMF for heavy duty vehicles. Furthermore, transit traffic exhibits a high EI, due to their high PMF. Finally, the EI is also high for going to work, but this is due to the stronger atmospheric stability in the morning. This effect is somewhat lowered by the low PMF for going to work.</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusions</Heading>
              <Para>In this chapter we have shown that different trip motives, due to their inherent differences in location of the emissions, road type used and time of the day at which they take place, have different influences on concentration and exposure. These differences lead to significantly different exposure estimates per kilometer driven for each motive. We can conclude that the response to the question posed in the title is positive, with a 1.3–1.4 times higher exposure for a kilometer driven to work compared to a kilometer driven for shopping.</Para>
