Even though Dr. Walt and Dr. Pellegrini are examples that are difficult to follow, their stories have a lot in common and show that foreign born individuals do serve in leadership roles in surgery.

This chapter also describes the career path of two general surgeons, both FMG, but from different continents, and how their culture has influenced their own leadership styles.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par2" TextBreak="No">In 1994, for the first time in the history of the American College of Surgeons (ACS), an individual who was not born in the United States (US) and had not trained in the US, was elected President. In his Presidential address delivered during the 78th Convocation of the ACS on October 13, 1994 Dr. Alexander J. Walt stated: “<Emphasis Type="Italic">I stand here as the first foreign medical graduate (FMG) to be President of this College…….The election of a FMG testifies to the great generosity of our American Society, to its warmth, tolerance, acceptance of strangers, willingness to experiment, and its disdain for artificial barriers…….</Emphasis>” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Nineteen years later, on October 6, 2013 another FMG, Carlos A. Pellegrini, gave his Presidential address in front of 1622 new fellows of the College as the 94th President. Of the 1,622 initiates, 346 (21.3 %) were from 55 countries around the world. Even though Dr. Walt and Dr. Pellegrini are examples that are difficult to follow, their stories have a lot in common and show that foreign born individuals do serve in leadership roles in surgery.</Para>

            <Heading>Foreign Medical Graduates (FMG)</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par3" TextBreak="No">In 2007, according to the National Residency Matching Program statistics, 22 % of General Surgery positions were filled by individuals who had graduated from medical schools located outside of the US [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. While some of them were American citizens, the majority were born and educated abroad. It is very important to separate these two groups. Generally, American citizens attended school and college in the US and then enrolled in a medical school abroad, mostly because they could not secure a position in one of the 125 medical schools in the US. After graduation, and after passing the required exams (i.e., the United States Medical Licensing Examination [USMLE]), they eventually obtained a residency position in the US. In contrast, the majority of FMGs were born and raised abroad, and went to school, college, medical school and sometimes even completed a residency in their own countries. For them the path to a residency position in the US is very cumbersome, as it involves learning a new language, passing the USMLE exams, and often doing a couple of years of research in the US before applying for a residency position. In fact, there is no reciprocal recognition of training between the US and the rest of the world, so that even surgeons who are board certified in their own countries must complete a residency in the US in order to be eligible for board certification and independent practice [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. It is a long and hard process that requires many sacrifices: (1) leaving their own country, their family, and their friends; (2) facing expenses for the multiple examinations (around $3,000) that are often equivalent to a 1 year salary in many underdeveloped countries [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]; and finally, (3) being immersed in an social and professional environment that is often radically different from their own. Language, beliefs, and family structure are unique to the American culture. For instance, in many other countries the role of the doctor is completely different, more “god-like”. Similarly, the role of nurses and other health care professionals, the concepts of informed consent, confidentiality, and documentation are unique to the American health care system [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par4" TextBreak="No">So why are so many individuals willing to undergo this long process and make considerable sacrifices? There are indeed some very strong personal and professional reasons. The US is still seen as a land of opportunity. It is seen as a unique place in the world where an immigrant can become educated and wealthy, and where meritocracy is still the norm rather than the exception. Thus, there is a strong desire for many to try to achieve a comfortable economic situation, guaranteeing an education and a better future for their own children. In addition, there are some characteristics of the surgical education in the US that are absolutely distinctive: it is a system that is open minded, flexible, grants graded responsibility, and practices a hands-on approach. In contrast to many other countries where training periods extend to 10–15 years before a surgeon is considered ready for independent practice, in the US a general surgeon is produced in 5 years, a neurosurgeon in 7 years, and a cardio-thoracic surgeon in 7–8 years. And contrary to many other countries, employment is a certainty after completion of training.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par5" TextBreak="No">Due to the shortage of American-born applicants to General Surgery programs, the number of FMGs will increase overtime. It is therefore important to understand and respect the cultural differences that exist. For the world of surgery it is a unique opportunity to create a work force characterized by the blending of many different cultures that will better serve a country blossoming with diversity.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par6" TextBreak="No">In this chapter, we will focus on the influence of culture on leadership. We will use the term FMG to indicate individuals who were born and educated abroad before doing their residency in the US.</Para>

This is a major obstacle to effective leadership as it can prevent a leader from understanding and valuing other people’s cultures. It can also make individuals less tolerant of other people’s behaviors. For instance, a leader that grew up in a culture that respects hierarchy and authority may find it difficult to deal with somebody that challenges his/her authority</Para>

For instance, while in the Nordic Europe cluster gender egalitarianism and institutional collectivism were very strong, in the Middle East cluster gender egalitarianism was very low as women are usually afforded less status than men and are rarely in a position of leadership. <Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab1">

For instance, a Confucian Asia leadership style is team-oriented but at the same time the leader uses status and position to make decisions independently, without the input of others. In contrast, in Anglo countries the leaders want to be non-autocratic, team-oriented and considerate of others. And they believe that face saving represents ineffective leadership.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par48" TextBreak="No">Overall the study identified positive leadership attributes (confidence building, honesty, excellence-oriented, and motivational) and negative attributes (autocratic, non-cooperative, asocial, irritable).

Furthermore, the GLOBE project stresses the importance of abandoning our ethnocentric behavior and opening our mind to different perspectives, with the goal of developing a richer understanding of the leadership process.</Para>

            <Heading>The FMG and the American Training System</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par50" TextBreak="No">As mentioned before, the path is very long for a FMG to get into an American residency program, often the end result of a process that can take anywhere between 3 and 7 years. Most FMGs enjoy tremendously the training period. Even if they have completed a residency in surgery before, they treasure the teaching in pre- and post-operative care, the multi-disciplinary approach to the care of the patient, the progressive independency in the operating room, the evolving role as teachers for those who come after them. There is no question that at the beginning of the training the FMGs feel a sense of pressure, the need to prove to themselves and the people that put their trust in them that it was not a mistake. The completion of training brings a unique sense of relief, the realization that it was possible to function at the same level as an American medical graduate and succeed in a different system.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par51" TextBreak="No">As the end of the residency gets closer, however, the FMG has to make an important decision, something that has a tremendous impact in his/her future, both personally and professionally. It is the difficult choice between securing a job in the US and starting a path toward citizenship versus going back to the country of origin. Clearly it is a balance between different powerful forces. On one side, there is the realization that working in the US is very gratifying. As shown by the example of others who have reached the pinnacle of American surgery, the US system allows the individual to reach his/her full potential and be rewarded for hard and high quality work. Along with the professional satisfaction there is the certainty of an economically safe life, with the possibility of providing opportunities and an education to their own children, something often not possible in their country of origin. On the other hand, there is the realization that staying in the US means to be away from family, friends, habits, and life style as it was. In a way, it depends on the degree of assimilation that has occurred during the years of training. Some FMGs have chosen <Emphasis Type="Bold">integration</Emphasis>, the conscious decision to accept different rules as a need to function in a culture different from their own, a culture that is not embraced, with preservation of their own values. This is typified by the FMG that goes home after work and spend time only with members of his/her own cultural group, speaking the language of their childhood, trying to raise his/her own children if they were not in the US. In such a situation the individual feels a tremendous pressure and lives a dichotomous life, American while at work, foreigner when at home. For other FMGs a slow process of <Emphasis Type="Bold">assimilation</Emphasis> occurs during training. It is based on the acceptance of new values, different beliefs, and a different life style. For a person who has only reached a state of integration, there is often the regret of “what life could have been” if he/she went back to their country of origin after completion of training in the US. However, the person who has been slowly and consciously assimilated into the US culture lives without regrets, enjoying the newly acquired status.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par52" TextBreak="No">Clearly these different emotional situations have a very profound effect on the way the person will behave if in a position of leadership. The person who tries to hold on his/her own culture will try to impose the values and characteristics of two different worlds, often failing and creating tension in the work place environment.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par53" TextBreak="No">In contrast, the individual fully or partially assimilated in the American system will show a leadership style that conforms to the “Anglo cluster” previously described. This person enjoys his/her acquired position and is grateful to the system, frequently trying to help others along the same difficult path.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par54" TextBreak="No">Some of these concepts are better explained by personal examples.</Para>

            <Heading>From Italy to the US</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par55" TextBreak="No">I was born and raised in Catania, a town on the west coast of Sicily. After completing high school (there is no college in Italy), at age 18 I enrolled in medical school, one of 1,500 new students who aspired to become physicians. I completed medical school at the top of my class, and I was accepted in the General Surgery program at the Vittorio Emanuele II hospital in Catania. Needless to say, I was enthusiastic about this choice. I was motivated by the desire to become a competent surgeon and by the ability of making a difference in other people’s lives. The enthusiasm and the dreams, however, were short lived as I soon realized that the system was not designed to prepare one for an independent practice before age 45–50. The Chairman of the Department of Surgery performed all the difficult cases, leaving very little to other faculty members and residents. Interestingly, he had trained in the United States where he had enjoyed very much the educational system. Back in Sicily, however, he felt he could not change the culture of the place and went back to the dictatorial and autocratic system that he had left (please note that I always refer to male figures as there were no female faculty or female residents). There was no formal mentoring or teaching, and we mostly learned by observing, reading, and performing simple cases. Needless to say, I soon became disillusioned and I looked for a way to escape this reality. This presented in the form of a fellowship that supported research abroad. With the blessing of my Chairman, I applied and was accepted for a 1-year research position at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). There I worked under the guidance of Lawrence W. Way and Carlos A. Pellegrini. I have to confess that the cultural shock was tremendous, and I am not only talking about the different language. Professionally, I soon realized I was in another world. Even though both Drs. Way and Pellegrini were very busy surgeons, they were always available for meetings during which they took the time to teach the intricacies of research, from formulating a hypothesis to designing an experiment to test it. But what struck me even more was the way resident education was structured. Interns and junior residents were taken through simple cases, while senior and chief residents were performing complex procedures. Residents were given progressive responsibility for patient care and Chief residents managed their services and were treated as junior colleagues by the faculty. This world was present and close, but yet incredibly far away for a foreigner. One year of research became 3 years, and after passing the required examinations, I applied through the National Residency Matching Program. In June of 1986, I started all over again as an intern in General Surgery at UCSF.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par56" TextBreak="No">I have wonderful memories of the years I spent training: it was hard work but it was incredibly gratifying. Every day I felt I was learning something new, becoming a better physician. After graduation I was sent by Dr. Haile Debas (the Chairman at UCSF at that time) to train at the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong with Professor John Wong. I went with one of the Chief Residents who graduated with me in 1993. Still, today, I remember my colleague’s reaction to being immersed in a very hierarchical and autocratic system, and how he demanded things rather than earning them. While for him it was a real cultural shock, I adapted really fast and enjoyed my time!</Para>
            <Para ID="Par57" TextBreak="No">After going back to UCSF, I spent the following 14 years working at Moffitt-Long Hospital as junior partner to Dr. L. W. Way (Carlos Pellegrini had moved to Seattle to become Chair of the Department of Surgery). Looking back, I can only be incredibly grateful to Dr. Way for his mentoring. He took a well-trained but rough individual and over time he transformed him into a surgeon. I also treasured the continuous, albeit long distance, mentorship that Dr. Carlos Pellegrini has provided over the years, making sure that I excelled in other aspects of academic surgery, such as scholarship and leadership in surgical societies.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par58" TextBreak="No">In 2008, I accepted the offer of Dr. Jeff Matthews, and moved to the University of Chicago where I assumed the position of Director of the Center for Esophageal Diseases. This was indeed a major honor, as I was trying to continue the tradition of Drs. David Skinner and Tom DeMeester, resuscitating a program that had been slowly dying after their departure [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. The rest is history.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par59" TextBreak="No">Overall, if I look back and examine this 31 year journey, from Catania to Chicago, what have I learned? How has this experience affected the way I lead other people? <UnorderedList Mark="Bullet">

From my country of adoption, I have learned the importance of embracing other cultures and be tolerant of differences, avoiding being ethnocentric, and be open to other people opinions with the goal of achieving a shared objective.</Para>

            <Heading>From Uruguay to the US</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par65" TextBreak="No">Although from Uruguay, I was a product of a mixture of the French and British system of medical training. In this type of system there is no college so that after high school (typically when 14–15 years old), you have to make a choice into a diversified pathway that is designed to lead you into a specific discipline. At this young age, many of my peers struggled with their decisions. For some reason, I always knew I wanted to be a Surgeon, so I chose the biological disciplines. Although the disadvantage of this system is that it forces people to make difficult and life-altering choices early on in their lives, it has the advantage of initiating profession-specific training at a much earlier age than in the US. Thus, it prepares you for life in Medical School and afterwards very effectively.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par66" TextBreak="No">I entered Medical School in the top 3 % and graduated from it in the top 1 %. During my training years, I became an Instructor of Anatomy, a highly coveted position where a large number of students compete for one of ten positions available every year. The experiences of teaching Anatomy in Medical School at such a young age was a powerful influence in my career, as I learned early on that the best available way to learn is to teach others. After the required 6 years of Medical School training, I competed for one of the roughly 100 positions available in the country as an Intern, managing to enter in the top 3 %. Eventually, I worked my way to a surgical House Staff officer position, where for 3 years I learned the intricacies of Surgery.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par67" TextBreak="No">At this point, at the age of 25, I had to make a very difficult decision: stay home and fight an uphill battle, or leave my home country and come to the US. Like in Italy, Uruguay has a very autocratic and hierarchical system where you truly do not gain independence from your elders until your early to mid-40s. Not only that, but after so many years of relying on a competitive system to advance through the ranks, once you hit the job market, jobs in most private hospitals become very difficult to obtain without connections inside the system. Facing this reality, I married my lovely bride, Luisa, and we decided to come to the US for our grand adventure. We really did not have a clue as to what was in front of us, but there was no turning back.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par68" TextBreak="No">Why the US? Like so many other FMGs, I was attracted by a system that can be best described as a meritocracy, as opposed to the autocracy that I was used to. Simply put, in the US, if you are willing to sacrifice and commit to your development, you will have a shot at earning your way. That prospect was a very powerful driver that allowed us to push through what can be described as the trials of entrance into the US surgical training system, passing the NBME exams (today’s USMLE exams) and eventually the two FLEX exams (they do not exist anymore) in order to be licensed.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par69" TextBreak="No">Since the ACGME does not recognize surgical training abroad, I also had to repeat my surgical training. The challenge was to find a spot as a surgical resident. I reasoned that despite scoring very highly in my entrance exams, I was facing an uphill battle. Therefore, I decided to apply for a Surgical Research Fellowship position. Dr. Joel Roslyn, who I had briefly met in Uruguay while he was lecturing there, and who was moving from UCLA to the Medical College of Pennsylvania as a freshly minted Surgery Chairman, offered me a position as a Research Fellow. Dr. Roslyn not only gave me the opportunity to get started in the US, but he also became the most influential mentor in my career development; I will be forever grateful for his kindness, mentorship, and support. Under his guidance, our research laboratory became extremely productive and I was able to obtain a PhD degree in Molecular Pathobiology. This time in the lab became the platform that allowed me to eventually become a categorical resident at MCP-Hahnemann and it effectively launched my career as a surgeon in the US.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par70" TextBreak="No">I absolutely loved my time in training and embraced it wholeheartedly. I was fascinated by the concentrated exposure to difficult disciplines, the system of progressive responsibility, and the emphasis on perioperative management. Above all, I loved the camaraderie with my fellow residents and the strong spirit de corps that we developed. We were, in the truest of ways, a team, and I knew that this was where I belonged. Unfortunately, shortly after MCP-Hahnemann became part of the AHERF system, AHERF went bankrupt. Simultaneously, Dr. Roslyn became ill and died way too young, cutting short a spectacular career in Academic Surgery. The residency program descended into severe turmoil and we all faced a difficult decision: to stay or to leave. I felt an enormous debt of gratitude to Dr. Roslyn, and decided to stay and finish what we had started together. This was a unique experience since we had the opportunity of working very closely with the new Program Director in re-shaping our training program. In the most unlikely of circumstances, we all learned the powerful value of working together as one.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par71" TextBreak="No">After residency, I was accepted for a 2-year fellowship in Surgical Oncology at MD Anderson. It was at Anderson where I learned the value of multidisciplinary care. It was a dream come true to be able to learn from some of the very brightest minds in the world of Oncology. After Anderson, I took my first job as faculty at the Medical College of Georgia, where we helped start a Surgical Oncology program and also participated in the creation of an MD/PhD Program in Oncology.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par72" TextBreak="No">After Georgia, I accepted a job at Baylor College of Medicine initially as the Chief of General Surgery and Surgical Oncology. At Baylor I have been fortunate to be able to help recruit and develop extraordinary faculty with whom we have developed multiple multidisciplinary programs for cancer, colorectal diseases, and advanced minimally invasive surgery. I am now a Vice Chairman for our Department and the Director for Surgical Network Development for our school. In the process, I have gone from mentee to mentor of many of our students, residents, and faculty; I consider this awesome responsibility my most important job.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par73" TextBreak="No">Along the way, I was very fortunate to become the first Hispanic president of the Association for Academic Surgery. I joined the AAS at a critical juncture in the life of this marvelous academic surgical society. It was at the AAS that I learned some of the most valuable lessons in collaborative leadership, and where I first realized that the whole is a lot more powerful than the sum of the parts. Over the last two decades, I have been blessed to work with truly amazing and passionate individuals. Together, we have embraced diversity like very few other societies have, and became an all-inclusive society with representation from people from all races, genders, and all walks of academic life. It is this diversity that helped transform the AAS into the vibrant and energetic dynamo that is today. It was the influx of fresh ideas and points of view that allowed the development of so many program-building new initiative such as the Fall courses, the international academic career development courses, and other global health initiatives, and many more.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par74" TextBreak="No">We are all the result of our collective upbringing, life experiences and mentorship. Together, these form a powerful cultural shaper that comes to define the frames that we use to see ourselves, and each other. When I reflect on how my experiences have helped develop my leadership style and qualities, I think the most important lessons that I learned are the willingness of embracing diversity and the force multiplying value of developing richly textured teams. Ultimately, it is all about building Programs, and allowing these programs to become the matrix where academic surgeons are nurtured and developed.</Para>
