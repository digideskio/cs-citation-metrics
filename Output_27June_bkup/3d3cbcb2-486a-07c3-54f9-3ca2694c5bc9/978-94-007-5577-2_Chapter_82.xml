              <Para>PMCAMx-2008, a detailed three-dimensional chemical transport model, was applied for the first time in Europe to simulate fine organic aerosol concentrations during the months of May 2008, February 2009, July 2009 and January 2010. The model includes a state-of-the-art organic aerosol module which is based on the volatility basis set framework treating both primary and secondary organic components as semivolatile and photochemically reactive. The model predicts that fresh primary OA (POA) is a small contributor to organic PM concentrations in Europe during the summer and spring, and that oxygenated species (oxidized primary and biogenic secondary) dominate the ambient OA. During the winter model results suggest a significant underestimation of OA emissions from wood burning. Use of very high resolution emissions inventory does not result in a significant improvement of the predictions of the model over the Megacity of Paris.</Para>

              <Para>Organic aerosol, although a significant component of submicron particles throughout the world, is poorly simulated by predictive models. Current Chemical transport models (CTMs) consistently underpredict OA mass concentrations at the surface during summertime conditions. CTMs have traditionally treated POA as non-volatile and non-reactive and SOA as semi-volatile products of VOCs’ oxidation. However, several recent studies (e.g. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00822">2</CitationRef>]) have shown that POA is semi-volatile while SOA can be seriously under predicted by models that use traditional SOA precursors and do not take into account further oxidation of these compounds.</Para>
              <Para>In this study we applied PMCAMx-2008 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00821">1</CitationRef>], a regional 3-D CTM, to the European domain, in order to simulate the OA formation during the months of May 2008, February 2009, July 2009 and January 2010. PMCAMx-2008 includes the recently developed volatility basis set framework to describe OA absorptive partitioning by organizing the total OA mass into surrogates along an axis of volatility. Nine surrogate POA species are used, with effective saturation concentrations at 298 K ranging from 10<Superscript>−2</Superscript> to 10<Superscript>6</Superscript> μg m<Superscript>−3</Superscript>. POA is simulated in the model in two types, “fresh” (not oxidized) POA and oxidized POA (OPOA). The SOA volatility basis-set approach used in the current version of the model includes four SOA species for each VOC with four volatility bins (1, 10, 100, 1,000 μg m<Superscript>−3</Superscript>). Laboratory results from recent smog-chamber experiments have been used to update the SOA module in PMCAMx in order to include anthropogenic aerosol yields. The model treats all organic species (primary and secondary) as chemically reactive. Chemical aging through gas-phase oxidation of OA vapors is modeled using a gas-phase reaction with OH. Each reaction step is assumed to decrease the volatility of the vapor material by a factor of 10.</Para>
              <Para>During the photochemically active period of May 2008, we evaluated the performance of the model against AMS ground measurements taken from various sites in Europe as well as airborne data. During the winter period of 2009 the model results are used to gain more insight into the sources and production of organic aerosol over Europe. Finally, during the July 2009 and January 2010 periods, we study the impact of horizontal grid resolution on predicted fine PM levels in the Megacity of Paris.</Para>

              <Heading>Results and Discussion</Heading>
              <Para>During the late spring period (May 2008), the model reproduces more than 87 % of the hourly data and more than 94 % of the daily averaged data within a factor of 2, for PM<Subscript>1</Subscript> OA. PMCAMx-2008 performs well in reproducing the high degree of oxidation as well as the average diurnal profile of the organic concentrations observed in the Eastern Mediterranean region. The model performance against the high time resolution airborne measurements of OA at multiple altitudes and locations is quite similar to its performance against the ground level hourly measurements. The model predicts that the Mediterranean region is the only area in Europe where PM<Subscript>1</Subscript> sulfate concentrations are much higher than the PM<Subscript>1</Subscript> OA during late spring, while organic matter is predicted to be the dominant PM<Subscript>1</Subscript> species over a large part of continental Europe. The model predicts low levels of fresh POA and that OA is dominated by oxidized primary OA (including IVOC oxidation products) (55–60 %) and biogenic SOA (30–35 %).</Para>
              <Para>During February 2009, PMCAMx-2008 predicts a higher contribution of fresh POA to total PM<Subscript>1</Subscript> OA (approximately 12 %) compared to the May period, on average over the entire domain. Oxidized POA is predicted to be the dominant OA component during this wintertime period with an average contribution of 46 % to the total predicted PM<Subscript>1</Subscript> OA. Contrary to the May period, a more distinct diurnal variation is predicted in most major urban areas following the diurnal variation of combustion emissions rates. When compared to AMS measurements from various sites all over Europe, the model performs reasonably well at most sites, however the results suggest missing wood-burning emissions in the inventories used, mostly in Scandinavia, east Germany, etc.</Para>
              <Para>The model was also used in a two-way nesting configuration to study the impact of different grid resolutions on organic aerosol predictions over the greater Paris area during a summer and winter. In an effort to stress more the differences between the two model grid configurations we combined high resolution emissions (1 × 1 km) with AMS measurement data and applied a high model grid resolution (4-km) over this Megacity in Europe (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00821">82.1</InternalRef>). <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00821">

              <Para>The model reproduces reasonably well the average observed diurnal profile of OA, while the contribution of local sources to OA in Paris is small to moderate during both periods (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00822">82.2</InternalRef>). Differences between the two grid simulation results in the Paris area are, on average, small for all species during the summer period. During the winter period there are significant differences in model predictions of mainly primary organics and black carbon. The major differences are seen for the maximum (morning peak) values in the two most polluted sites (LHVP and GOLF). The 4-km grid simulation captures the average diurnal concentration of fine organic aerosol better than the coarse grid. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00822">

              <Para>Much of the traditionally thought as particulate primary OA emissions are actually evaporating to produce low-volatility organic vapors which are the source (through photochemical aging) of a substantial amount of oxygenated OA that is distributed not only in urban and suburban areas but rural regions as well. PMCAMx-2008 tends to predict relatively flat diurnal profiles for PM<Subscript>1</Subscript> OA in many areas, both rural and urban during the late spring and summer. The model reproduces the relatively low OA concentrations in the free troposphere over Europe, suggesting that at least for this period there were no major missing OA sources aloft.</Para>
              <Para>During the winter, both the model results and the measurements point towards missing wood-burning emissions in the inventories used, mostly in Scandinavia. The improvement in model predictions with the use of fine grid is modest during the summer and somewhat more significant during winter in the Megacity of Paris. The use of very high resolution emissions does not lead to a significant improvement in the predictions of the fine grid simulation. These results suggest that the major reasons for the discrepancies between the model predictions and observations in both seasons are not due to the grid size used, but to other problems (e.g., emissions, process description, and meteorology).</Para>
