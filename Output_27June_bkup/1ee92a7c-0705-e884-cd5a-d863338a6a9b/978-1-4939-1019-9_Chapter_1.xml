          <Para>Weeds are the most important biological constraints in crop production systems. Herbicides are used to manage weeds; however, a heavy reliance on herbicides is not sustainable in the long run. Therefore, there is a need to develop ecologically based weed management strategies in different crop production systems, which aim to reduce the weed seed bank before crop sowing and reduce weed emergence and weed growth in crops. Some of the strategies to reduce the seed bank before crop sowing are the use of the stale seedbed technique and the adoption of practices that enhance seed predation and seed decay. Strategies to reduce weed emergence and weed growth in crops may include the use of appropriate tillage systems; retention of crop residue on the soil surface; the use of crop cultivars with weed competitiveness, allelopathy, and tolerance of germination under anaerobic conditions; the use of a high crop density; and the use of narrow row spacing. This chapter aims to provide a perspective on what can be done to improve ecologically based weed management strategies.</Para>

          <Para>Weeds are one of the most important biological constraints in agricultural production systems. They negatively affect crop growth and yield by competing with crops for nutrient, sunlight, space, and water. In some regions, especially in developing countries<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Developing countries</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, weeds are controlled by using hand weeding<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Weeding</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. However, manual weeding is becoming less common due to labor scarcity on farms and high labor wages [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. In other regions, herbicide use has allowed a massive release of labor from agriculture [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. The increased use of herbicides, however, has been accompanied by concerns over the evolution<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Evolution</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> of herbicide resistance in weeds, weed species population shifts, increased costs of herbicides, surface-water pollution, and effects on nontarget organisms [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. Therefore, a heavy reliance on chemical weed control is considered objectionable in some regions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. Water, as flooding, is used to manage weeds in crops such as rice<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Rice</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Oryza sativa</Emphasis> L.). However, farmers in many areas, especially in Asia, are expected to experience economic and physical water scarcity [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>], which may make it unfeasible for them to flood rice fields to ensure sufficient weed control<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Weed control</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. These concerns have increased the interest of weed scientists around the globe to develop ecologically based weed management<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Even in the era of herbicides, understanding the biology of weeds remains essential for developing effective weed management tactics [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]. In this chapter, we discuss ecologically based strategies to reduce the weed seed<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm> bank before crop sowing and to reduce weed emergence<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Heading>Strategies to Reduce the Weed Seed Bank</Heading>
          <Para>Weed seed banks are the reserves of viable weed seeds present on the soil surface and in the soil. These are the primary source of annual weed infestation in most crop production systems [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. Farmers would benefit from management practices that reduce weed seed input, increase weed seed losses, and reduce the probability that residual weed seeds establish [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. Weed seed banks are usually depleted through germination, predation, or death. Before discussing specific strategies, there is a need to better understand the effect of light and seed coat on weed seed<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Weed seed</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> germination.</Para>
          <Para>Light plays an important role in weed seed germination. However, the germination of different weeds in light and darkness varies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. Seeds of some species (e.g., <Emphasis Type="Italic">Avena fatua</Emphasis> L., <Emphasis Type="Italic">Malva parviflora</Emphasis> L., and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Mimosa invisa</Emphasis> Mart. ex Colla) germinate equally in light and dark; seeds of some species (e.g., <Emphasis Type="Italic">Eclipta prostrata</Emphasis> [L.] L. and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Cyperus difformis</Emphasis> L.) do not germinate in the dark at all; seeds of some species (e.g., <Emphasis Type="Italic">Galium tricornutum</Emphasis> Dandy) do not germinate in the light; and, for some weed species (e.g., <Emphasis Type="Italic">Echinochloa crus-galli</Emphasis> [L.] P. Beauv. and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Sisymbrium orientale</Emphasis> L.), light is not an absolute requirement for germination, but light stimulates germination [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>]. In the field, light conditions differ for weed seeds present on the soil surface, beneath the crop residue<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Crop residue</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> cover, or buried in the soil.</Para>
          <Para>Seeds of some weed species (e.g., <Emphasis Type="Italic">Malva parviflora,</Emphasis>
            <Emphasis Type="Italic">Mimosa invisa,</Emphasis>
            <Emphasis Type="Italic">Abutilon theophrasti</Emphasis> Medik, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Urena lobata</Emphasis> L.) have a hard seed coat, which imposes dormancy due to the impermeability of the seed coat to water or gases [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>]. Germination of such seeds is generally low unless they are scarified. In some species (e.g., <Emphasis Type="Italic">Rottboellia cochinchinensis</Emphasis> [Lour.] W.D. Clayton and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Raphanus raphanistrum</Emphasis> L.), dormancy is largely due to the pod surrounding the seeds [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>]. Mechanisms that increase breakdown of the pod will increase germination of species with such seeds. Possible factors that may account for a dormancy break in hard-seeded species and seeds surrounded by the pod are microbial and fungi attack, changes in temperature and moisture regimes, and fire [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>].</Para>
          <Section2 ID="Sec3">
            <Heading>Seed Predation and Decay</Heading>
            <Para>One way to reduce the size of weed seed banks is through mortality of newly produced weed seeds<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Weed seed</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> by predators [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>]<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Seed predation</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Seed predation has been recognized as an important means of seed mortality, particularly after seed shed [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>]. Weed seeds are most prone to seed predators while on the soil surface and burial makes seeds largely unavailable to most seed predators [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>]. Furthermore, weed seeds present on the soil surface are also prone to rapid decay due to unfavorable weather conditions, such as extreme changes in temperature and moisture fluctuations [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>]. Therefore, the use of no-till systems, in which most of the weed seeds remain on the soil surface, may expose weed seeds to seed predators. By delaying tillage<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Tillage</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> operations or creating an additional time lapse between seedbed preparation and seeding, the first weed flush can be easily controlled [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>]. The number of seed predators can be increased by creating better opportunities for shelter and additional food [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>]. For example, the management of field bunds, through creating favorable environments for seed predators by accumulating crop and weed residues on bunds rather than burning<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Burning</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> them, could provide a promising opportunity to encourage weed seed<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Weed seed</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> predation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>]. Similarly, organic cropping practices, especially cover cropping<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Cover cropping</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>, may increase the activity of weed seed predators [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Seed predation</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>.</Para>
            <Para>Different studies suggest that seed predation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Seed predation</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> can cause a substantial reduction in the number of weed seeds entering the seed bank, and therefore could contribute to ecologically based weed management<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> operation. As most of the weed seeds remain on the soil surface after crop harvest, this practice may help to reduce the weed seed bank. Most weed species sensitive to the stale seedbed practice are those that require light to germinate (as discussed in a previous section), have low initial dormancy, and are present on or near the soil surface. Some of these weed species are <Emphasis Type="Italic">Digitaria ciliaris</Emphasis> (Retz.) Koel., <Emphasis Type="Italic">Leptochloa chinensis</Emphasis> (L.)

The feasibility of this practice, however, should be assessed by farmers themselves, especially when the period between the harvest of the previous crop and the sowing of the subsequent crop is short.</Para>

An earlier study, for example, reported that a no-till system retained 56 % of the weed seeds in the top 1-cm soil layer, whereas a conventional tillage system buried 65 % of the seeds to a depth of 1–5 cm and only 5 % of the seeds remained in the top 1-cm soil layer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. In another study, about 85 % of all weed seeds were found in the top 5-cm soil layer in a reduced tillage<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Tillage</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> system and only 28 % of the weed seeds were found in this soil layer in the conventional tillage system [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>]. These studies suggest that no-till or reduced tillage systems leave most of the weed seeds on or near the soil surface. In some species (e.g., <Emphasis Type="Italic">Lolium rigidum</Emphasis> Gaud.), weed seeds present on the soil surface under no-till and zero-till germinate and emerge at a slower rate than seeds buried to a shallow depth by tillage<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Tillage</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Weeds emerging later and after the crop are likely to be at a competitive disadvantage against the crop in no-till than those emerging before or with the crop under conventional tillage systems [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para>As discussed in a previous section, seeds present on or near the soil surface are prone to seed predation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Seed predation</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> and decay. Therefore, adopting no-till systems for some crops may help to enhance seed predation and deplete the seed bank, resulting in fewer weed seedlings in the crop. In no-till systems, most of the weed seeds are present on the soil surface, where light may stimulate germination and help in reducing the seed bank through germination. In some situations, a large weed seed<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Weed seed</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> bank may accumulate on the soil surface. In such situations, a deep inversion tillage operation could be used to bury weed seeds below the maximum depth of their emergence. Most weed seedlings cannot emerge from depths more than 10 cm. A previous study also suggested that the success of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Alopecurus myosuroides</Emphasis> Huds. in reduced tillage systems could be overcome by plowing once every 5 years [<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>].</Para>

In rice, for example, the built-up population of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Ischaemum rugosum</Emphasis> Salisb. in wet-seeded rice was reduced by using a no-till system [<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef>]. Similarly, the increasing population of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Echinochloa colona</Emphasis> in no-till rice could be managed by shifting to wet-seeded rice [<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR39">39</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Primary>Crop residue</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> on the soil surface can also help suppress weed seed germination and seedling emergence; however, the extent of suppression depends on the quantity and allelopathic potential of the residue and the weed species [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR42">42</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef>]. The presence of large amount of crop residue on soil surface can substantially reduce and delay weed seedling emergence by preventing light penetration, decreasing thermal amplitude, and increasing the time needed for seedlings to emerge through the residue cover. Crop residues<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

In Australia, Vandeleur and Gill showed that there was a significant positive linear relationship between the year of wheat cultivar release and crop yield loss from weed competition, indicating the inferior competitive ability of the modern cultivars<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

In the future, the use of nitrogen fertilizers may rise in some crop production systems to meet the increasing food demand, and high nitrogen doses are known to cause lodging in tall cultivars [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Therefore, by selecting traits other than tall plant type, the trade-off between yield potential and competitive ability may be minimized.</Para>

Similarly, rice cultivars having high seedling vigor suppressed weeds to a greater extent, especially in rainfed and upland environments, where dry seeding is practiced [<CitationRef CitationID="CR59">59</CitationRef>]. In an earlier study, shoot length of rice was reported to have a positive correlation with fresh and dry biomass of seedlings, and vigor index [<CitationRef CitationID="CR60">60</CitationRef>]. Therefore, seedling vigor could play a critical role in dry-seeded rice<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Dry-seeded rice (DSR)</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> as it helps in better crop emergence and offers greater crop competition with weeds [<CitationRef CitationID="CR49">49</CitationRef>]. In general, the traits associated with weed competitiveness in rice<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Rice</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> are early canopy cover, high tiller density, droopy leaves, high biomass at the early stage, high leaf area index and high specific leaf area during vegetative growth, and early vigor.

Most efforts to select for improved weed competitive ability have focused on aboveground traits and little is known about the importance of root competition, especially in low-input production systems. Fofana and Rauber undertook one of the few competition studies in which crop varietal differences in root growth was investigated in rice (<Emphasis Type="Italic">O. sativa</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">O. glaberrima</Emphasis>) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR61">61</CitationRef>].

Some progress has been made in determining the role of allelopathy<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Allelopathy</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> in rice. Field experiments by Olofsdotter et al. revealed allelopathy accounted for 34 % of overall competitive ability in rice [<CitationRef CitationID="CR63">63</CitationRef>]. They have argued that optimizing allelopathy in combination with breeding for other weed competitive traits (e.g., early vigor) could result in crop cultivars with superior weed-suppressive ability. However, the benefits of allelopathy for weed management<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            <Para>In crops, such as rice, flooding is used to suppress weeds as most weed species cannot germinate and emerge under flooded conditions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. In the USA, rice is seeded in standing water (water seeding), mainly to suppress weeds. In Asia, however, flooding can be introduced only after the rice seedlings have emerged as rice cultivars capable of germinating under anaerobic conditions are not widely available.

            <Para>In Asia, rice is generally grown after transplanting of seedlings into puddled soil. Weeds are not a big problem in these establishment systems. However, there is a trend toward direct seeding (wet and dry seeding). In these systems, weeds are the number<Emphasis Type="Italic">-</Emphasis>one biological constraint. Recently, several studies reported the effect of increased seeding rates on weed suppression in direct-seeded rice systems. In one study, reducing the seeding rate from 80 to 26 kg ha <Superscript>−1</Superscript> increased weed biomass significantly and therefore a seeding rate of 80 kg ha<Superscript>−1</Superscript> was needed to avoid a large yield loss because of weeds [<CitationRef CitationID="CR55">55</CitationRef>]. Results from another study in India and the Philippines showed that the maximum grain yield of an inbred cultivar was achieved at 95–125 kg seed ha<Superscript>−1</Superscript> when grown in the presence of weeds; however, seeding rates from 15 to 125 kg ha<Superscript>−1</Superscript> had little effect on yield in weed-free conditions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR67">67</CitationRef>].
