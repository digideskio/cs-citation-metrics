              <Para>The results from epidemiology time series models that relate air quality to human health are often used in determining the need for emission controls in the United States. These epidemiology models, however, can be sensitive to collinearity among co-variates, potentially magnifying biases in the parameter estimates caused by exposure misclassification error or other deficiencies in the time series models by orders of magnitude. As a result, we examined collinearity among several covariates typically used in air quality epidemiology time series studies (ozone, fine particulate matter and its species, and temperature). In addition, we examined the ability of a bias-correction technique applied to estimates simulated by the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to “fill-in” for the spatial and temporal limitations of observations for purposes of reducing exposure misclassification. Specifically, we evaluated whether the bias-adjusted CMAQ estimates could replicate the correlation among variables seen in the observations. The results presented are for a domain east of the Rocky Mountains for the entire 2006 year and indicate that collinearity among covariates varies across space.</Para>

              <Para>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) relies predominantly on epidemiology time series studies to estimate future health impacts of emission controls [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00091">1</CitationRef>]. High correlation among explanatory variables used in these studies can result in inaccurate results when applied in health impact assessments. In addition, the assignment of the wrong exposure value differentially (misclassification) can mask the true health effect of a pollutant [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00092">2</CitationRef>]. To address these two issues, this study examines (1) the collinearity that exists among ozone, particulate matter and its species, and temperature; and (2) whether we can fully represent this natural relationship among covariates in the deterministic, 3-dimensional Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. This latter objective is particularly relevant due to the paucity of measurements for some pollutants (e.g., speciated fine particulate matter) that are typically measured once- in-3-days at relatively few locations in the U.S.</Para>
              <Para>Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig00091">9.1</InternalRef> shows an example of a typical time series model used in an epidemiology study and the collinearity between ozone and temperature for ten summers (1997–2006) in New York State. Collinearity can also exist between ozone and fine particulate matter. Multicollinearity among covariates can magnify the effect of bias introduced by autocorrelation, misclassification error or other model deficiencies by orders of magnitude. Thus, while it doesn’t necessarily reduce the predictive power or reliability of a model when all collinear covariates are included, it can affect calculations regarding individual predictors, such as when the main effects coefficients are used to assess health impacts. If the covariates (and relationship among them) in the new dataset differ from the data that was fitted, it can introduce large errors in predictions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00093">3</CitationRef>]. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00091">

              <Para>Misclassification (inaccurately assigning exposure across space or time differentially) can also introduce errors in epidemiology time series studies. Air quality models, such as CMAQ, can help fill in missing measurement data but contains some bias due to uncertain emissions and meteorology input data, as well as limited knowledge of the physical and chemical processes governing the formation of ambient pollutants. Hence, CMAQ model estimates were combined with observations [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00094">4</CitationRef>] to produce bias-adjusted pollutant estimates with the objective of providing more spatially and temporally complete ambient air pollutant data for use in epidemiology studies. As part of this study, we examined the ability of the model alone, and the bias-adjusted model to reproduce the relationships that exist in the observed covariates used in a standard epidemiology study.</Para>
              <Para>The objectives of this study were to (1) examine whether the temporal variability seen intimated by CMAQ and adjusted CMAQ reflect those seen in observations, and (2) understand what pollutants are correlated with each other and with temperature.</Para>

                </ExternalRef>) for 2006. Measurements of O<Subscript>3</Subscript> and PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> were available for each day, whereas, measurements for PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> species were available for 1-in-3 days only. Daily averages were also calculated from the hourly concentrations simulated by the CMAQ model v.4.5 at a 12 km horizontal grid resolution. The meteorology and emissions inputs for this simulation were from the Fifth-Generation NCAR/Penn State Mesoscale Model (MM5) and EPA’s 2001 National Emissions Inventory, respectively. The 12-km simulation encompassed most of the Eastern U.S. and was nested within a 36 km × 36 km horizontal grid simulation covering the contiguous U.S. using the same model configuration as the 12-km nested simulation. Finally, the observations and modeled estimates were combined using a multiplicative adjusted bias approach described in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00094">4</CitationRef>] to produce daily averaged estimates as described above. To summarize the process, the ratio of observed to modeled values is calculated for each grid cell containing an observation. These ratios are interpolated using a kriging technique and then applied to the CMAQ estimates to produce a “bias-adjusted” value for each CMAQ grid cell. Pearson correlation coefficient (R) was calculated to measure the temporal dependencies.</Para>

              <Para>Bias-adjusted CMAQ estimates captured the temporal variability seen in observations for most pollutants (objective 1). Challenges, however, still remain in estimating EC because of the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of this pollutant. In addition, spatial differences in capturing the observed temporal variability were seen for OC along the Southern coastline and NO<Subscript>3</Subscript> along the Western edge of the domain and in the South. With regard to collinearity among variables (objectives 2 and 3), ozone is positively correlated with PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript>, SO<Subscript>4</Subscript> and temperature at most sites, reflecting the dominant SO<Subscript>4</Subscript> component of PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> mass and its common source with secondarily formed ozone from photolysis. Strong spatial patterns existed for several pollutants, with very strong spatial correlations between ozone and nitrate and ammonium in the Southeastern U.S. (not shown). As expected, PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> is highly correlated with most of its constituents (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00092">9.2</InternalRef>), but surprisingly, not as correlated with NO<Subscript>3</Subscript>, perhaps due to seasonal differences (e.g., high correlation in winter, but relatively low correlation in summer for the domain studied). The correlation between PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript>, and EC and OC is strongest in the upper Northwest portion of the domain, most likely due to wood burning. Correlation between PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript> and NH<Subscript>4</Subscript> is dominant in the Eastern U.S. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00092">
