              <Para>We present here the set-up and performance of a data assimilation system dedicated to air quality based on the Regional Chemistry Transport Model (RCTM) CHIMERE and an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). Our focus is on surface ozone concentration over the European domain. Data assimilation provides a framework to the estimation of the error budget for both observation and model. Particularly, the ensemble Kalman filter methodology [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00396">5</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00397">6</CitationRef>] offers a recursive flow dependant correction of both the ozone state and the associated model error covariance. Concerning the surface ozone data assimilation, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) as well as the Reduced Rank Square Root filter (RRSQRT) was firstly set up within the LOTOS-EUROS model. It has been demonstrated that theses ensemble filters improve the quality of the ozone fields compare to unassimilated stations with only a small ensemble size [<CitationRef CitationID="CR003911">10</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR003914">12</CitationRef>]. In our assimilation system, we choose to implement the deterministic Ensemble Square Root Filter (EnSRF) in order to avoid the sampling error induces by the perturbation of the observation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00398">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR003916">14</CitationRef>]. In the following, we first give more details on the CHIMERE model, then we present the observation that are used. Also, the assimilation method is presented. Finally results of an assimilation exercise are presented and discussed.</Para>

The global chemistry transport model MOZART-3 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR003912">11</CitationRef>] running at 1.875° × 1.875° has been coupled to IFS [<CitationRef CitationID="CR003910">9</CitationRef>] and provides global trace gas composition on a hourly resolution (three-hourly storage). Thus we obtain three-hourly boundary conditions that are temporally and spatially interpolated on the CHIMERE grid. The deterministic CHIMERE reference run covers June/July/August of 2009 and its output is used for the initialization of the assimilation period.</Para>

              <Para>It is necessary to define an objective subset of observations in order to provide a guideline of simulation verification. In this study, we calculate the daily variability and the daily mean for the entire available background airbase stations (with altitude under 300 m above sea level) in order to get an objective classification of station type following the approach developed by Flemming et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00399">8</CitationRef>]. As urban stations are not representative of areas on the order of the model resolution, we do not use stations corresponding to urban environment. Thus, we retain three ozone stations types with an increasing daily variability from background/mountain (MOU, 96 stations) for remote site, ‘RUR’ for rural (240 stations), ‘PUR’ (‘U1’, 395 stations) for suburban. Despite the use of a different period and a different geographical distribution, the shape of the ozone profile is similar. Because of the variability criterion, stations located in the north Scandinavia that have in average a lowest daily mean are considered here as background stations. In general, suburban stations are situated around the pattern of polluted environment around large urbanized areas like Paris and Berlin or the Pô valley.</Para>

              <Heading>Data Assimilation Method (EnSRF Formulation)</Heading>
              <Para>Firstly introduced by Evensen [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00396">5</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00397">6</CitationRef>], the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm is a sequential filter where Monte-Carlo methods are used to sample the errors statistics. Here, an ensemble of 20 perturbed model state evolve forward in time by the deterministic model which determines the model forecast variances and covariances. Then, we perform a local analysis with a cutoff radius of 250 km around the analysis cell. The impact of the covariance localization is efficient dealing with air quality analysis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00393">4</CitationRef>]. After the analysis step, we put additive white noise perturbations to the ozone state with a fixed decorrelation length [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00396">5</CitationRef>] of 200 km [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00392">3</CitationRef>]. Following Boynard et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00391">2</CitationRef>], we apply the same perturbation approach applied to the main parameters driving the ozone concentrations in the CHIMERE model which are the anthropogenic emissions, boundary conditions, the land-use, the vertical diffusion coefficient and the photolysis rate. In this case, the error variance doesn’t bring enough spread in the ensemble compared to the additive perturbation of the ozone field itself. As a consequence it reduces only very slightly the RMSE. Assuming no observational error correlation, the R matrix is defined by the observation error variance (diagonal terms). An observation error standard deviation of 5 ppb is used in this study which is common to previous data assimilation system [<CitationRef CitationID="CR003911">10</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00391644">15</CitationRef>].</Para>

              <Para>The CHIMERE-EnSRF has been run for ten days from the 14th of August to the 23th of August 2009 in order to obtain reliable statistics of the system. This period was characterized by a short pollution episode on 19th and 20th august, but with a large spatial extent. We define randomly an ‘assimilation’ and a ‘validation’ subset of stations (with respectively 368 and 347 stations). In this simulation, we define an arbitrary standard deviation of the additive perturbation of 25 % at night (7 p.m. to 6 a.m.) and 15 % (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) in the day time. Result in the forecast standard deviation is very close to the prescribed noise which is slightly higher in the nighttime and lower in the day time. The amplitude is in the range of the model error distribution and is found to be sufficient relatively to the observation error by comparing the total error in the system to the resulting forecast RMSE. The RMSE of the analysis is reduced over all stations type used for validation with an average decrease of more than 2 ppb (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00391">39.1</InternalRef>). The temporal correlation between the analysis and the observation is enhancing for all stations type. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00391">

              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: Model-obs difference shows diurnal cycle with a clear bias at night, probably due to the limited vertical resolution of the model. Should not you try to correct this bias rather than just increasing the uncertainty of nighttime data?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: The absolute observation error variance of 25 ppb<Superscript>2</Superscript> used in this study is therefore relatively more important in the nighttime, considering the total error profile; we also decide to increase the relative model error noise. Regarding the assimilated observations, the bias is considerably reduced at the analysis step, but also in the following one hour forecast. As the bias has a spatial and temporal variability, we prefer to correct the bias in the assimilation procedure as it is based on the model error covariance matrix.</SimplePara>
