              <Heading>The Changing Workplace: An Overview</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Rapid and continual changes in technology, and an aggressive and competitive business climate, are often noted as some of the more decisive forces that have directly impacted the modern workplace. Globalization, the “economic interdependence among countries that develops through cross-national flows of goods and services, capital, know-how, and people” (Gelfand, Erez, &amp; Aycan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002436">2007</CitationRef>, p. 481), is another powerful event that has irrevocably altered business and industry. The growing global connection among businesses has had a substantial impact on the people who work in organizations, as many workers are now venturing out on short- and long-term international assignments. Yet, it is important to note that both cross-national and <Emphasis Type="Italic">intra</Emphasis>-national events have influenced today’s business environment. For example, while globalization has resulted in more and more international workers joining US organizations, US minority populations in the past decade have significantly increased. According to the 2010 US Census, both the Asian and Latino populations grew a dramatic 43% each since 2000. Moreover, the Department of Labor reports that today’s minority labor force (which includes both the employed and unemployed) is made up of 47% women, 15% Latino, 12% African–American, 5% Asian–American, and 15.8% foreign-born workers. Employment projections reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002412">2009</CitationRef>) note that, by 2018, the minority labor force will increase considerably (Latinos by 33%, Asian-American by 30%, African-American by 14%, women by 9%), compared to White workers (5.5%). These numbers, along with increases in minority populations, indicate that this cultural shift in the work environment is not simply a temporary situation but rather a progressive pattern that will continue to have an effect on organizations and employees. People who represent various countries, ethnicities, and cultures are now, and will continue to be, closely interacting with one another at work.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Many researchers proclaim the enhanced organizational benefits that result from a having diverse workforce, such as increased competitiveness, innovation, and creativity (Chavez &amp; Weisinger, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002415">2008</CitationRef>; Fine, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002433">1996</CitationRef>; Hobman, Bordia, &amp; Gallois, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002441">2004</CitationRef>; Meares, Oetzel, Torres, Derkacs, &amp; Ginossar, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002461">2004</CitationRef>). These claims have been received with caution by researchers who warn that simply hiring individuals from diverse backgrounds will not necessarily guarantee that organizations will reap the benefits associated with a diverse workforce (Jayne &amp; Dipboye, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002447">2004</CitationRef>; Roberson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002476">2006</CitationRef>). It is the organization’s mindset (i.e., its general philosophy that guides specific practices, policies, and procedures) that will be the best indicator of how companies approach this changing work environment (Findler, Wind, &amp; Mor-Barak, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002432">2007</CitationRef>; Meares et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002461">2004</CitationRef>; Mor-Barak &amp; Levin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002465">2002</CitationRef>), and the impact that these changes will have on individual workers. Is workplace diversity a “problem” that organizations must “deal with?” Or, is workplace diversity an opportunity that will give organizations an advantage in an increasingly competitive global market? To answer these questions, organizations must first assess their objectives for establishing diversity<Footnote ID="Fn00241">
                  <Para TextBreak="No">For purposes of this discussion, we focus on gender, cultural, and ethnic diversity. The authors acknowledge that diversity can be defined using “the entire spectrum of human differences” (Jayne &amp; Dipboye, p. 410) including age, sexual orientation, level of education, physical and/or mental disability, physical appearance, political affiliation, marital status, organizational tenure, job class, personality, socioeconomic status, religious beliefs, or any other characteristic or attribute that differentiates one individual or group from another.</Para>
                </Footnote>. If the decision to increase diversity is based only on legal obligations, the resulting organizational environment will be much different than if the decision is based on the desire to accumulate unique perspectives. In order to fully capitalize on the potential benefits of a diverse workforce, organizations need to shift from a mindset of tolerating differences to one of inclusion where diversity is perceived as a valuable component to organizational effectiveness (Erez, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002430">2011</CitationRef>). Altering the organization’s mindset in this manner lays the foundation for building a multicultural organization which, in turn, will lead to a healthy work environment.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">As organizations continue to employ people from a variety of culturally diverse backgrounds, the effects on behavior at work, including the way in which individuals are treated and the subsequent physical, psychosocial, and emotional effects of that treatment, are likely to be significant. Thus, it is the purpose of this chapter to address the workplace consequences of this demographically shifting US population. What are the organizational objectives in terms of increasing diversity in the workplace? If a diverse workforce contributes to an organization’s competitive advantage, why do many organizations struggle to achieve the promised results? This chapter addresses these and other questions in detail and presents a framework that conceptualizes a variety of organizational environments derived from the combination of specific organizational elements. The framework also describes the associated health-related consequences that may potentially result from these various organizational environments. Finally, the chapter ends with a discussion about how organizations can create and promote a healthy, inclusive work environment. The key for organizations will be to develop a shared organizational identity, while simultaneously allowing for individuals to retain their own cultural characteristics. In this sense, true multiculturalism is achieved along with total organizational health.</Para>

              <Heading>A Focus on Diversity and Health</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">One of the recent challenges of occupational health psychology, as noted by Tetrick and Quick (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002489">2011</CitationRef>), is related to the demographical shifts occurring in the workplace. To the extent that occupational health psychology is still an emerging field (Barling &amp; Griffiths, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00248">2011</CitationRef>; Peiró &amp; Tetrick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0024104">2011</CitationRef>), issues related to organizational demographics can be considered recent challenges; however, organizational problems associated with culture and diversity are certainly not new. Historically, in the USA, women, minorities, and migrant workers have experienced pervasive, flagrant, and even state-sponsored workplace discrimination. The psychosocial, physical, and institutional effects of discrimination are well-documented (Clark, Anderson, Clark, &amp; Williams, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002416">1999</CitationRef>; D’Anna, Ponce, &amp; Siegel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002420">2010</CitationRef>; Thompson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002492">1996</CitationRef>; Williams, Yu, Jackson, &amp; Anderson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0024100">1997</CitationRef>). In general, perceived discrimination has been shown to impact blood pressure (e.g., Armstead, Lawler, Gorden, Cross, &amp; Gibbons, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00246">1989</CitationRef>), perceived stress, anxiety, and depression (e.g., Landrine &amp; Klonoff, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002453">1996</CitationRef>; Pascoe &amp; Richman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002471">2009</CitationRef>), psychosocial distress and well-being (Kessler, Michelson, &amp; Williams, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002449">1999</CitationRef>), quality of, and access to, health care (Briggance &amp; Burke, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002411">2002</CitationRef>), illness and workplace accidents (Gany et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002435">2011</CitationRef>) and injuries and disease rates on the job (Murray, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002467">2003</CitationRef>). Specifically in the workplace, perceived discrimination affects job satisfaction and increases the likelihood of job burnout, job stress, and poor mental health (Roberts, Swanson, &amp; Murphy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002477">2004</CitationRef>). Clearly, the current focus of attention on workplace health and diversity is both urgent and welcomed.</Para>

              <Heading>Defining the Constructs</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Organizations that implement diversity initiatives, such as training and development programs and hiring strategies, yet struggle to achieve the desired outcomes, may focus on such factors as culture, ethnicity, race, and/or gender to describe or identify potential causes. Rarely, however, are these terms properly distinguished or defined in specific and concrete ways (e.g., practices, behaviors, or beliefs) so that they can more easily be assessed and modified (Betancourt &amp; Lopez, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002410">1993</CitationRef>). To provide a clearer and more detailed account of the relationship among occupational health, culture, and gender, it is necessary to clearly define the constructs used in practice that pertain to diversity in order for organizations to better address the health problems that are implicated in the specific aspects of these constructs. For example, as noted in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00241">24.1</InternalRef>, culture can be conceptualized as systems of meaning that are learned and shared by a people or a segment (or segments) of a population (Rohner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002478">1984</CitationRef>). Subjective aspects, such as shared social norms, roles, beliefs, values, and practices are elements of culture (Triandis &amp; Brislin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002494">1984</CitationRef>). Subjective culture can be further specified in terms of gender roles, familial roles, communication patterns, affective styles, values regarding personal control, individualism, collectivism, spirituality, and religiosity. Ethnicity has been used interchangeably with culture; however, ethnicity refers to groups of people characterized in terms of a common nationality, culture, and/or language (Gelfand et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR002436">2007</CitationRef>). Specifically, ethnicity refers to the national or tribal affiliation of a group. Both ethnicity and culture are closely related and sometimes are hard to differentiate; cultural backgrounds can shape people’s ethnic identity or affiliation, and being part of an ethnic group or groups can shape cultural patterns. Finally, ethnicity and race have also been hard to differentiate due, in part, to both being utilized interchangeably with culture and nationality by a variety of disciplines including psychology, law, government, and business. Historically, racial categories have been used to classify people in terms of observable physical characteristics with the purpose of creating hierarchies among human beings (Corcos, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002417">1997</CitationRef>; Smedley &amp; Smedley, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002483">2005</CitationRef>). However, evidence has shown that there is no scientific support for the idea that races exist (Olson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002469">2005</CitationRef>). Data have demonstrated that genetic variability is greater within than between “racial” groups (Bamshad, Wooding, Salisbury, &amp; Stephens, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00249">2004</CitationRef>).<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00241">

              <Para TextBreak="No">The meanings that people attribute to these constructs compound the problems that organizations experience. Often, these terms are used synonymously, and people behave and make decisions based on their view that race, ethnicity, and culture are not distinguishable. For example, out-group categorization and discrimination against minority coworkers may occur due to the color of an individual’s skin. Furthermore, people may make attributions about a coworker’s beliefs and behaviors based solely on this type of superficial characteristic. Current classification systems used by the US federal government facilitate and reinforce the idea that racial categories exist, which further contributes to the ongoing confusion regarding ethnicity and race. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) continues to use race as a descriptor that often overlaps with ethnicity. As noted on Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00241">24.1</InternalRef>, the EEOC’s definition of ethnicity (i.e., national origin) uses physical characteristics as an indicator equivalent to language and culture. As further evidence of the blur between the constructs, Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00241">24.1</InternalRef> also summarizes how the EEOC defines discrimination. Despite the evidence against the concept of race or the idea that physical characteristics can be used as markers of ethnicity and culture, this classification system is widely used by researchers and practitioners. We distinguish between ethnicity and culture (although we acknowledge their relatedness), specifying ethnicity in terms of group affiliation and culture as a system of shared beliefs, norms, and values of a (ethnic) group. We further argue that race is a socially constructed term that may impede the understanding of the relationship between culture and health, and may contribute to discrimination in the workplace. A similar problem occurs between the definitions of sex and gender, as both tend to be used interchangeably which hinders the understanding of the processes that link organizational diversity initiatives and health (see Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00241">24.1</InternalRef>). Sex refers to the biological and physiological differences between men and women. Behaviors and activities directly related to biological differences are defined as sex roles (e.g., pregnancy or breastfeeding). Gender, on the other hand, refers to behaviors or patterns of activities that society or culture deem appropriate for men and women. Gender roles are the expectations for behaviors and attitudes that a particular culture defines as appropriate for men and women (e.g., expectation that women stay at home to rear children, or the assumption that women do not need competitive salaries because their male partners are the main breadwinners). Because these distinctions between sex and gender are often blurred, the potential to attribute and conflate gender differences to inherent biological differences increases. This, in turn, may lead to the belief that the causes of behaviors, and the behaviors themselves, are hard or even impossible to change (e.g., women cannot be good leaders because they are “too emotional”).</Para>

              <Heading>Cultural Differences in Values and Behavior</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Cultural values are associated with differences in beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, and these differences can shape the structure of organizations as well as the relationships within. Therefore, a helpful way to understand the impact of culture and gender on organizations is by examining how cultural values may facilitate and/or hinder some behaviors (e.g., discrimination, acceptance, harassment). Cultural values reflect the learned beliefs and behaviors that are shared by specific groups of individuals which distinguish them from other groups of individuals, and are shaped by culturally guided norms, emotions, and patterns in thinking (Plaut, Markus, &amp; Lackman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002473">2002</CitationRef>). In his seminal work, Hofstede (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002442">1994</CitationRef>) identified four major dimensions of cultural values: collectivism–individualism, power distance, masculinity–femininity, and uncertainty avoidance. These dimensions have been extensively used to explain and predict cross-national differences in values and behaviors (Spector et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002485">2004</CitationRef>). The collectivism–­individualism dimension relates to the degree to which a culture is more or less group oriented. Cultures that are high in individualism emphasize an independent, self-focused orientation, while cultures that are high in collectivism emphasize an interdependent, group-focused orientation. Power distance refers to the extent to which cultures encourage or maintain differences in power and status in interpersonal relationships. High power distance cultures favor centralized and authoritarian decision-making. The masculinity–femininity dimension relates to the degree to which cultures maintain stereotypical differences between men and women. For example, in a feminine society, men and women would be similar in feminine-type traits such as caring and modesty, whereas, in a masculine society, men would be more assertive and competitive compared to women. Uncertainty avoidance refers to a culture’s degree of comfort or discomfort in ambiguous or unstructured environments. Cultures that are low on uncertainty avoidance would be more comfortable with, and tolerant of, vague situations.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Organizations that are composed of individuals from different cultures naturally will experience a wider range of diversity in employees’ attitudes and behaviors. For example, research notes that, in certain collectivistic cultures, maintaining indirect eye contact while conversing is considered a sign of respect (Chang &amp; Spector, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002414">2011</CitationRef>). However, in other cultures, this act may infer that one group is more dominant over another. Hofstede’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002442">1994</CitationRef>) dimensions have also been used to demonstrate cross-cultural differences and similarities in how conflict is expressed and resolved. For example, in low power cultures, such as the USA, workers may be more likely to cooperate and use open communication instead of avoidance or conformity when resolving conflicts with coworkers (Tinsley, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002493">2001</CitationRef>). Similarly, in high femininity cultures, conflict is more likely to be resolved by engaging in problem-solving (Van Oudenhoven, Mechelse, &amp; de Dreu, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002497">1998</CitationRef>). These types of conflict resolution methods can result in lower levels of physical problems. Additionally, in terms of resolving conflict, research has shown that individualistic cultures prefer a direct, competitive style where one person’s goals are achieved at the expense of another’s and winning is key, whereas in collectivistic cultures, compromise is key and individuals prefer to resolve conflict indirectly using avoidance (Gelfand et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002436">2007</CitationRef>; Liu, Spector, &amp; Shi, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002455">2007</CitationRef>). Avoidance is not invoked in order to ignore issues, but rather to protect relationships and maintain harmony.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Other research highlights the negative outcomes associated with culture and interpersonal relations at work. Of special concern is verbal abuse and bullying. For instance, research has shown that high power distance, individualistic, and masculine organizations may facilitate organizational bullying (e.g., Einarsen, Raknes, &amp; Matthiesen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002425">1994</CitationRef>; Vartia, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002498">1996</CitationRef>). Bullying in an organizational context has been related to low job satisfaction (Loh, Restubog, &amp; Zagenczyk, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002456">2010</CitationRef>) and increased anxiety (Mikkelsen &amp; Einarsen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002462">2001</CitationRef>). It must be noted that bullied individuals may be more likely to be perceived as being part of the “out-group” and as having lower status (Loh et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002456">2010</CitationRef>). These perceptions may result in increased victimization of those individuals who hold lower-level jobs, such as minorities and women, and result in worse health outcomes for those who suffer from bullying. When the values of an organization (i.e., an organization’s mindset) are not consistent with the values of the larger culture, individuals may interpret and react to conflict and bullying in a way that may be more detrimental to their health. For example, women from a low power distance country, such as the USA, but who work in a high-power distance organization, may experience more health problems and lower job satisfaction than women from a culture where high power differences between supervisor and supervisee are more accepted (Mikkelsen &amp; Einarsen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002462">2001</CitationRef>). Differences in cultural values have also have been shown to affect the workplace in terms of job satisfaction and perceptions of justice which, in turn, can affect individuals’ mental and physical health (Robbins, Ford, &amp; Tetrick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002475">2012</CitationRef>). For instance, low levels of perceived justice within the organization have been associated with more sleeping problems, sickness absences, and mental health (Elovainio, Kivimaki, &amp; Vahtera, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002426">2002</CitationRef>; Tepper, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002488">2001</CitationRef>). These differences can exacerbate work and perceived organization conflict. Research has shown that conflict with supervisors is indirectly associated with mental and physical health via job satisfaction (Faragher, Cass, &amp; Cooper, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002431">2005</CitationRef>); whereas conflict with coworkers has a direct impact on mental and physical health (Frone, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002434">2000</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Cultural values can also affect workers’ health by favoring males or females at work and/or by influencing where work is performed, the types of jobs available, and the number of hours worked. For example, in some high masculine societies, men tend to choose more hazardous jobs than women (e.g., construction and manual labor), which can have a negative cumulative effect on their physical health. These types of jobs may result in early disability and physical dysfunction which, in turn, may lead to early retirement. Health risks associated with job choice have been related to the shortened life expectancy for men, although this accounts for a small percentage of the difference (Donkin, Goldblatt, &amp; Lynch, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002423">2002</CitationRef>). Job choice can also negatively affect women’s health. Traditionally feminine jobs, such as some health professions (e.g., nurse or midwifery) or care-giving occupations (e.g., teacher), may increase health risks such as infectious diseases and/or burnout for women who tend to be overrepresented in these lines of work. Preoccupation with one’s job may also have differential effects on health outcomes. In societies where females are expected to raise children at home, and males are expected to be the main source of household income, men invest more time at work than women and are at higher risk for workaholism (Snir &amp; Harpaz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002484">2009</CitationRef>). Workaholics have been found to report higher levels of physical problems and poorer emotional health (Burke, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002413">2000</CitationRef>; Andreassen, Ursin, &amp; Eriksen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00244">2007</CitationRef>). Women, on the other hand, are more likely to show presenteeism (i.e., the tendency to attend or stay at work despite being ill). Presenteeism can negatively affect the health of women who are in highly demanding jobs, such as nursing, midwifery, and teaching, by exacerbating the effects of the illness conditions (Aronsson, Gustafsson, &amp; Dallner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00247">2000</CitationRef>; Martinez &amp; Ferreira, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002459">2011</CitationRef>). In collectivist communities, where men’s and women’s social roles are similar (for both work and household contributions), gender differences in health tend to disappear (Anson, Levenson, &amp; Bonneh, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00245">1990</CitationRef>), and the male–female mortality gap is smaller (Leviatan &amp; Cohen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002454">1985</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Differences in cultural values not only exist and affect behavior at the cross-national level but also at the regional or intra-national level. In fact, Plaut et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002473">2002</CitationRef>) state that “…regional culture should not be ignored as an important shaper of psychological functioning” (p. 166). Plaut and colleagues assessed indicators of well-being in the USA, finding both agreement and variability across five US regions. Consistent with American ideology, one indicator of well-being that did not vary across the USA was control (i.e., feeling that one can accomplish anything if one wanted). However, between-region variability was found for many of the indicators. For example, compared to areas in New England, people in southeastern regions of the USA were less likely to view autonomy as an indicator of well-being. Also, compared to north-central regions, people in certain southwestern regions were more likely to describe themselves as lively and outgoing.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">In a diverse organizational environment, interactions among people are complex and are further ­complicated by the beliefs and social norms held by different groups. Strong evidence points to a connection in how differences in culture, cultural values, and gender shape and affect individuals and relationships at work. The above examples demonstrate that differences in values and cultural characteristics can exist anywhere. Individuals who engage in behaviors that are consistent with their cultural-specific or gender-specific norms, yet perform outside of a certain accepted model, may be viewed as atypical and thus may be a target for discrimination and exclusion. It is this dynamic which can lead to psychosocial and physical health-related problems.</Para>

              <Heading>Discrimination and Exclusion</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">That women and minorities in the workplace have experienced, and continue to experience, more discrimination compared to their White male counterparts, including mistreatment (Meares et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002461">2004</CitationRef>), alienation (Findler et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002432">2007</CitationRef>; Mor-Barak &amp; Levin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002465">2002</CitationRef>), and bias and harassment (Morris, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002466">1996</CitationRef>), points to how organizations have traditionally approached diverse cultural viewpoints. The recent influx of international workers into the USA adds another layer of complexity to what has already been an existing challenge associated with workplace diversity. Discrimination at work is of great concern because perceived discrimination has been associated with poorer mental and physical health, and increased stress in a variety of settings (Pascoe &amp; Richman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002471">2009</CitationRef>). Similarly, research in organizational settings has revealed that individuals who report high levels of racial discrimination are more likely to report worse physical health (De Castro, Gee, &amp; Takeuchi, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002421">2008</CitationRef>), and greater levels of perceived stress (Wadsworth et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002499">2007</CitationRef>), than their colleagues who report low levels of ­discrimination. At the forefront of this challenge is an organizational mindset which has traditionally excluded women and minorities from the mainstream culture (Cox &amp; Nkomo, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002419">1990</CitationRef>; Mor-Barak &amp; Levin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002465">2002</CitationRef>). Power, in terms of decision making, access to information, and other organizational processes, is typically held by the mainstream culture, and this majority culture is the basis for comparison and judgment of the values and workplace behavior of every other culture (Fine, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002433">1996</CitationRef>; Meares et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR002461">2004</CitationRef>). Karasek and collaborators have shown that lack of access to decision-making can result in negative health outcomes for workers (e.g., Karasek, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002448">1990</CitationRef>), such as increased depression and anxiety (Egan et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002424">2007</CitationRef>). For women, low decision control on the job can negatively affect physical and mental health, especially if coupled with high job demands. For example, in a large study with over 30,000 women, Amick et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00243">1998</CitationRef>) found that women in high demand jobs who have low levels of control reported increased physical and mental strains when compared to women with high demands/high control jobs. By virtue of their dissimilar characteristics compared to the majority culture, women and minorities may continue to experience lack of decision control and exclusion from the core functioning of the organization. Findler et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002432">2007</CitationRef>) stated that diversity characteristics are related to the way employees are treated. Therefore, those who have dissimilar characteristics are more likely to perceive detachment from the mainstream group. Over time, the concerns of the mainstream become the only concerns and, it is the responsibility of groups outside of the mainstream to conform to these established norms.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Fine (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002433">1996</CitationRef>) indicates that, historically, African-Americans and women are often judged using White males as the norm. She also notes the psychological and physical damage associated with individuals who feel compelled to assimilate into the dominant culture. Assimilation requires a great deal of energy to keep the genuine, true self repressed in order to “fit” with the mainstream, but assimilation does not necessarily equate to lack of discrimination. On the contrary, it merely highlights the division between the majority and the minority. Eventually, the effort expended on assimilation takes its toll in the form of anger and stress. The phenomenon of working hard at the expense of one’s health has been termed “John Henryism,” and refers to an individual’s predisposition to display unrelenting attempts to cope with stressors even in the face of significant barriers (James, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002446">1994</CitationRef>). John Henryism has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension among African-Americans of lower socioeconomic status (Taylor, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002487">2006</CitationRef>). Given an organizational environment where clear boundaries exist between the majority and the minority, fit by assimilation will never be achieved and those individuals who continue to work hard despite the unachievable will be at a higher risk of developing more adverse physical and psychosocial conditions. Moreover, people who expend energy on coping and assimilating will have less energy to perform their jobs well. Thus, the consequences to the organization are also negative (Fine, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002433">1996</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">An additional line of research has investigated the role of gender stereotyping and discrimination against women in the workplace. Because women make up a minority portion of managerial positions, confusion exists regarding how women should act in management roles to be perceived as effective leaders. If a female leader acts in a caring manner, her behavior may be perceived as a sign of weakness yet, if she acts using stereotypical male characteristics (e.g., assertiveness, competitiveness), her behavior can be perceived as going against typical gender roles. This ambivalent approach can lead to fewer women succeeding in top positions. However, women that do succeed in incongruent job positions (i.e., careers considered typically male) may be more likely to experience negative health outcomes, such as increased levels of stress (Jacobs, Tytherleigh, Webb, &amp; Cooper, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002445">2010</CitationRef>). Lyness and Thompson (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002458">2000</CitationRef>) identified several barriers to women’s advancement in managerial positions, including lack of fit with male-dominated cultures, stereotyping about women’s abilities, and exclusion from informal networks with males peers. Women, regardless of their job positions, are also more vulnerable to hostile behaviors such as sexual harassment. Approximately one-quarter of women in the workforce report having experienced sexual harassment (Ilies, Hauserman, Schwochau, &amp; Stibal, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002443">2003</CitationRef>; Krieger et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002451">2006</CitationRef>). High levels of harassment are associated with lower job ­satisfaction, poorer mental health, less satisfaction with life (Schneider, Swan, &amp; Fitzgerald, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002482">1997</CitationRef>) and increased blood pressure levels (Krieger et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002450">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">The harmful physical and psychosocial effects of workplace discrimination are clear. Workers who are subjected to an adverse or hostile organizational environment will not be in a position to add value to the organization. Moreover, it is likely that workers will not want to contribute to organizational functioning if they are not feeling valued. This places organizations at risk of not successfully achieving their goals, as organizations that continue to repress individuals lose out on the opportunity to explore diverse points of view. Not tapping into the knowledge and experiences of every employee limits organizational learning, and the promised benefits of a diverse workforce will not be achieved.</Para>

              <Heading>The Importance of Context</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Erez (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002430">2011</CitationRef>) notes that culture is a construct that can be represented at multiple levels (cross-national, intra-national, organizational, group, etc.) which suggests that, depending on the context, (e.g., organizational philosophy, structure, values), cultural characteristics can range from very similar to very dissimilar. Mor-Barak (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002463">2000</CitationRef>) indicates that the definition of diversity is context-dependent. Therefore, context should not be overlooked when evaluating what is considered typical. As an example of this, suppose a Muslim woman employed at an American Halal food processing company dresses in traditional Islamic clothing, including a hijab or headscarf. In this context, she may not be perceived as atypical. However, within a different context, such as in an American retail clothing store, she is likely to have more trouble fitting in (e.g., see <Emphasis Type="Italic">EEOC v. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Stores</Emphasis>). In the context of a majority/minority organizational environment, control and the retention of power and privilege of the majority are main characteristics that separate the mainstream group from all other groups. Although Meares et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002461">2004</CitationRef>) found that cultural groups who are silenced at work can resist (e.g., muted group theory), oftentimes those who are considered in the minority group will be excluded from organizational events. Findler et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002432">2007</CitationRef>) describe exclusion in terms of an inclusion–exclusion continuum, where individual characteristics dictate where a person falls. Salient characteristics, such as skin color, sex, accent, and language, are likely to be the primary means to identify mainstream versus minority group membership. Research has shown significant mean differences between groups where Whites felt more included than African-Americans and Native Americans, and males felt more included than females (Mor-Barak &amp; Levin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002465">2002</CitationRef>). Yet, characteristics that are capable of excluding individuals are not limited to physical characteristics. Differences in cultural values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors can affect how people approach work (Fine, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002433">1996</CitationRef>; Meares et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002461">2004</CitationRef>) which, in turn, can affect how people are treated in the workplace, particularly when different from expectations of the mainstream (Thomas &amp; Inkson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002491">2004</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">It is important to note that, although women and minorities have historically been the targets of workplace exclusion (Mor-Barak &amp; Levin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002465">2002</CitationRef>), the agents of the exclusionary acts are not necessarily White and male. Rather, the source of an exclusionary environment lies with the organization’s culture (i.e., mindset) where the organizational norms and expectations are cultivated. Culture, in this sense, refers to the shared and deeply embedded belief system that usually stems from, and is filtered through, the organization’s founders and leaders (Schein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002479">1990</CitationRef>). It is safe to say that a majority of US organizations have been established by White males, which may be reason enough to explain why the shared values common to that particular demographic have, in general, dictated the beliefs, traditions, norms, and behavior of most US organizations. Statistics show that White males continue to occupy a majority (70%) of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Fortune 100</Emphasis> board of director seats (Alliance for Board Diversity Census, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00242">2010</CitationRef>). However, if culture can be portrayed as context-dependent and multilevel, “mainstream” is likely to change from context to context depending on the dominant set of practices and ideas in a given environment (Mor-Barak, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002463">2000</CitationRef>). The mainstream is not designated to one particular culture or set of ideals exclusive of all others in every circumstance or environment. A non-Spanish speaking White employee working in a company that values bilingualism may be just as likely to face exclusion and discrimination as a non-English speaking Latino employee working in a company that holds traditional Anglo values. In fact, in a study conducted using New York City police officers, Morris (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002466">1996</CitationRef>) found that, compared to women and minority officers, White male officers who worked within an ethnically diverse department and who served an ethnically diverse population perceived less positive social interactions with supervisors and felt more alienation. Thus, the mainstream adjusts based on contextual factors. In this sense, <Emphasis Type="Italic">any</Emphasis> group or individual is a potential target of discrimination and exclusion.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Research and theory from social psychology have demonstrated the complex dynamics of exclusion in terms of the impact on it has relationships between people. In essence, exclusion occurs because individuals deviate from a prototype envisioned by the majority group. Abrams, Hogg, and Marques (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00241">2005</CitationRef>) assert that “the effects of exclusion are almost wholly negative” (p.14). Exclusion threatens the self-concept and an individual’s need to belong, and results in a variety of adverse physical and psychosocial conditions. Empirical investigations have shown that exclusion lowers an individual’s sense of well-being (Mor-Barak &amp; Levin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002465">2002</CitationRef>), and leads to more aggression and procrastination, and less cooperation and intelligent thought (Twenge &amp; Baumeister, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002495">2005</CitationRef>). In the workplace where group coordination and interaction are vital to many organizational processes, exclusion will have a powerful impact on organizational productivity and effectiveness. Rather than providing an environment where all employees participate fully, often individuals from diverse backgrounds are marginalized which, in turn, prohibits organizations from gaining the competitive advantage that a diverse workforce is supposed to provide (Mor-Barak, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002463">2000</CitationRef>). Although little research on the effects of exclusion on health has been conducted in the workplace, this evidence suggests that perceived exclusion or rejection is associated with poor psychosocial health (Hitlan, Cliffton, &amp; DeSoto, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002440">2006</CitationRef>), specifically increased levels of depression (Penhaligon, Louis, &amp; Restubog, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002472">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Whether individuals perceive themselves to be included or excluded will be based on a comparative evaluation relative to others (Mor-Barak &amp; Cherin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002464">1998</CitationRef>; Roberson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002476">2006</CitationRef>), and this comparison will affect an individual’s interpretation of where he or she stands in the social environment. Mor-Barak and Cherin (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002464">1998</CitationRef>) note that “…inclusion and exclusion are at the root of psychosocial well-being” (p. 49). Indeed, other research (Mor-Barak &amp; Levin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002465">2002</CitationRef>) has demonstrated a strong relationship between inclusion and both job satisfaction and employee general well-being (absence of depression and strain). Often, however, these “soft” outcomes are given minimal attention by organizations in favor of more financially based indicators of effectiveness such as organizational productivity. Thus, given the conventional wisdom that proclaims a diverse workforce leads to improved organizational performance, bottom-line productivity may be an organization’s main or sole ­motivation in establishing a diverse workforce, while employee well-being is overlooked or dismissed ­altogether. In some instances, organizations may welcome diversity, but employee inclusion may be assumed rather than proactively managed. In other instances, the organization’s culture may be far from embracing diverse viewpoints, choosing instead to dismiss or ignore those who deviate from the mainstream. A truly healthy organizational environment is one that considers not only the organizational financial bottom line but also the well-being of all employees within (Grawitch, Gottschalk, &amp; Munz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002437">2006</CitationRef>), as ultimately the success of any organization rests with its employees. Therefore, organizations that wish to promote total health and success will need to first assess the factors that influence the existing organizational environment.</Para>

              <Heading>A Framework for Conceptualizing Diversity Environments</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Research reveals the reciprocal influence of the organization’s embedded philosophy or values (i.e., the organization’s mindset) and the organization’s observable practices, policies, and procedures. That is to say, the organization’s values guide the practices that employees engage in, and implementing new organizational practices and policies can influence existing values (Schneider, Brief, &amp; Guzzo, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002480">1996</CitationRef>; Schneider, Ehrhart, &amp; Macey, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002481">2010</CitationRef>). The development and implementation of the organization’s overall strategic objectives are also influenced by the values and practices of the organization. This interplay among organizational values, practices, and objectives is a key factor in determining the organizational environment. The resulting organizational environment, in turn, could have a critical impact on workers’ health. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig00241">24.1</InternalRef> provides a framework that combines these organizational elements to produce an organizational environment wherein employees’ attitudes and behaviors are cultivated. Drawing on, and integrating, a variety of research and conceptualizations, this framework is designed to show how the organizational environment develops through the relationship between the mindset of the organization and the actual practices that organizations engage in. The organizational mindset is depicted through an exclusion–inclusion continuum as discussed previously. Organizational practices are represented by degree of management activity and effort expended toward creating and managing diversity initiatives, such as hiring strategies, and training and development programs. Both researchers and practitioners stress the critical influence of management involvement on organizational practices because managers are the key representatives who develop and enforce these practices. In addition, actions by management provide cues regarding appropriate attitudes and behaviors of employees (Cox, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002418">1991</CitationRef>; Peiró &amp; Tetrick, 2011).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00241">

              <Para TextBreak="No">***The framework also provides de facto organizational objectives to show how this particular organizational element may be at odds with what the organization claims or thinks are its objectives. The misalignment between objectives and the environment could be the critical factor that hinders organizations from capitalizing on the full potential of a diverse workforce. Including organizational objectives on the framework will help those organizations to better understand why diversity initiatives may not be contributing to the success of the organization so action can be taken to ameliorate the environment. Finally, the framework conceptualizes the influence that all of these organizational factors have on workplace health. As noted throughout this chapter, research has verified that an environment of intentional discrimination increases stress levels and mental health problems. A similarly stressful yet different atmosphere is an ambiguous environment where the organization’s espoused objectives are at odds with the actual practices of management (Podsakoff, LePine, &amp; LePine, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002474">2007</CitationRef>). In fact, the alignment between what the organization values and its practices has been recognized as being critical to workplace health (Grawitch et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002437">2006</CitationRef>). Ultimately, the framework will allow an organization to reflect upon what it wants to achieve (objectives), what it is actually able to achieve (mindset and practices), what might be expected as a result (environment), and the consequences of these on employee occupational health. The following section describes a variety of organizational environments produced from the combination of practices and mindset, and the resulting health outcomes from those environments. It should be noted that the organizational environments are arranged vertically and quasi-hierarchically on the framework, under the three main columns of organizational objectives. Until future studies verify the placement of each environmental construct, it is impossible to pinpoint the exact location of organizational environments in relation to the other constructs represented on the framework (i.e., organizational practices, organizational mindset). Each environmental construct may (or may not) overlap with another and to an unknown degree. This contingency is noted by the dotted lines within the framework.</Para>

              <Heading>Legal Mandate</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In the least inclusive sense, the organization’s de facto objective behind diversity hiring may be only to comply with EEOC requirements. In this organization, the majority culture dictates the policies and procedures, and diverse viewpoints are of little importance. Thus, there is little need to proactively manage diversity initiatives beyond monitoring EEOC compliance requirements. This type of organization might be compared to Cox’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002418">1991</CitationRef>) monolithic organization, where the organizational environment is composed of high levels of segregation and cultural bias, both of which produce prejudice and <Emphasis Type="Italic">discrimination</Emphasis>. Although the civil rights movement significantly reduced the overt monolithic organization in its truest sense, the fact that thousands of reasonable cause discrimination charges are filed with the EEOC annually (nearly 5,000 in 2010) is a demonstration that discrimination continues to plague organizations. Beyond satisfying hiring quotas, diversity initiatives meant to benefit the organization will likely fail, and the discriminatory environment will continue to produce negative health-related outcomes for workers (e.g., Wadsworth et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002499">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Organizations that maintain an exclusionary mindset yet provide a moderate amount of active management might perpetuate an environment of <Emphasis Type="Italic">segmentation</Emphasis>, both across and within jobs where (a) lower status jobs are overly represented by women and minorities and (b) higher status jobs keep women and minorities isolated and underutilized. These organizations may engage in particular job placement strategies, for example, relegating lower status jobs to individuals based on certain ethnic or gender characteristics. Physical demands of these lower status jobs may result in increased health problems for ethnic minorities and women (Lundberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002457">1999</CitationRef>). For those individuals who do rise to management positions, participation in organizational processes and decision making is limited or nonexistent. This incongruence between what individuals expect to do on the job compared to what the organization allows them to do can produce physical and/or psychosocial distress. Research has demonstrated the negative effects that perceived racial segmentation has on the psychosocial well-being of African-Americans, particularly in jobs of higher status (Forman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0024102">2003</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Even when a proactive management approach is taken, the emphasis of diversity initiatives will be on differences rather than on the potential for a collective organizational identity because the mindset continues to be exclusionary. For example, research has documented that the failure of diversity training programs is due in part to the training’s focus on differences that serve to perpetuate stereotyping and promote a “we-they” perception (Chavez &amp; Weisinger, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002415">2008</CitationRef>). <Emphasis Type="Italic">Differentiation</Emphasis> is underscored in Thomas and Ely’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002490">1996</CitationRef>) access-and-legitimacy organizational paradigm, which notes that this type of environment “pigeonholes” workers into positions where their physical attributes (i.e., perceived race), gender, or ethnicity is highlighted and aligned with demographically similar customers. Diverse viewpoints are not integrated into the organization’s mainstream culture but are considered only to the extent that they correspond to demographically similar customer markets. “Exploited” and “devalued” are terms that workers have used when describing how they feel within this type of environment (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002490">Thomas &amp; Ely</CitationRef>). Overall, if the driving organizational strategy behind diversity hiring is a legal ­obligation, both individual health and well-being, and total organizational health, suffer.</Para>

              <Heading>Equality</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Midway between the inclusion and exclusion continuum lays the organizational objective of equality. Similar to the access-and-legitimacy paradigm, hiring quotas and compliance still strongly influence diversity initiatives. However, unlike the emphasis on differences of the access-and-legitimacy ­paradigm, here the emphasis is on sameness. Additionally, unlike the monolithic typology of total exclusion, this organization’s mindset can be described as fair and respectful. Thus, the organization is more comparable to Thomas and Ely’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002490">1996</CitationRef>) discrimination-fairness paradigm where fairness is enforced. Within this environment, women and minorities are respected and overt discrimination is significantly reduced. However, the organization does not go so far as to allow the contribution of differing viewpoints. This sameness-fairness organizational mindset can produce a variety of organizational environments depending on the level of active diversity management. For example, combined with limited management, an environment of <Emphasis Type="Italic">assimilation</Emphasis> might evolve where minorities are expected to adopt the norms of the majority culture at the expense of losing their own cultural identity. An assimilation environment might also exist even in organizations where a moderate amount of active diversity management occurs. This type of organization might be compared to Cox’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002418">1991</CitationRef>) pluralistic organizational. Cox noted that this organizational typology falls short of full cultural integration much like the discrimination-fairness organizational paradigm where minority workers must resign their cultural norms in order to fit in with the majority culture. Forcing people to assimilate, rather than allowing them to express their cultural individuality, affects self-esteem and perpetuates feelings of social isolation. The health-related problems of assimilation were discussed previously and were noted as being particularly detrimental to both the individual and the organization (Fine, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002433">1996</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Cox’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002418">1991</CitationRef>) pluralistic organization is also characterized by a skewed minority worker population so, along with an environment of assimilation, this organization may also produce an environment of <Emphasis Type="Italic">tokenism</Emphasis>. A moderate amount of diversity management under the discrimination-fairness paradigm may equate to ensuring the minimum percentage of women and minorities are represented in the hiring process. In turn, an even smaller percentage of minorities are actually hired. In this sense, diversity hiring is seen as symbolic, which serves to draw attention to those “token” employees who are hired. Although the organization enforces color blindness and gender blindness, the fact that women and minorities represent a significantly smaller percentage of the organization’s workforce tends to make them stand out (in addition to the obvious physical differences). This type of visible notoriety can result in increased pressures to perform. Researchers have noted that tokenism is complex, involving more than just minority representation and percentages in the workplace (Stichman, Hassell, &amp; Archbold, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002486">2010</CitationRef>), but also includes psychosocial factors such as feelings of inadequacy which leads individuals to question their own competence. Some consequences of tokenism include increased depression, anxiety, lower levels of self-esteem, and stress on the job (Jackson, Thoits, &amp; Taylor, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002444">1995</CitationRef>; Krimmel &amp; Gormley, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002452">2003</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">An organization that practices a proactive management style within the objective of equality may take fairness to the extreme because fairness is not part of the cultural integration process, it is the end itself. The zeal to better integrate minorities and women into the organization may even lead to reverse discrimination and preferential hiring. Mostly, however, the organization devotes a great deal of effort to ensure that hiring quotas are met and everyone is treated equally. Differences among employees are not acknowledged, thus the environment might be characterized as <Emphasis Type="Italic">undifferentiated</Emphasis>. Sameness and conformity are emphasized in an attempt to maintain harmony, yet the organization continues to operate within a majority/minority mindset. The combination of a suppressed minority workforce and a persisting mainstream culture causes tension among employees and leads to resentment and distrust of management. Individuals’ unique contributions are not supported. Thus, women and minorities will continue to be marginalized resulting in a higher risk for health problems (Hitlan et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR002440">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Cox (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002418">1991</CitationRef>) notes that the multicultural organization is characterized by (a) full organizational ­integration of minority cultures, (b) the elimination of cultural bias, and (c) the elimination of the majority/minority gap. This type of organization can be compared to Ely and Thomas’s (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002427">2001</CitationRef>) integration-and-learning paradigm. Keys to this organizational typology are the emphasis placed on the inclusion of diverse perspectives and the integration of these perspectives into the organization’s core functioning. A true multicultural organization is composed of individuals from diverse backgrounds whose ideas are valued, supported, and incorporated into the organization’s overall operation (Cox, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002418">1991</CitationRef>; Nahavandi &amp; Malekzadeh, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002468">1988</CitationRef>; Thomas &amp; Ely, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002490">1996</CitationRef>). Improved productivity and organizational effectiveness are much more likely within a multicultural organization, but are highly dependent upon top management’s commitment toward true multiculturalism. As noted on the framework, inclusion is maximized in the multicultural organization, meaning that this organization will have a mindset that focuses on valuing human relationships. Therefore, the critical factor for this organization in achieving the full benefits of a diverse workforce will rest mainly on the organizational ­practices and the proactive management of diversity initiatives.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The multiple perspectives inherent within a multicultural organization produce a variety beliefs and attitudes. Thus, effort is required by leaders to implement and direct the policies that will guide appropriate employee behavior. Organizations that acquire an inclusionary mindset, but do not actively manage diversity issues, may produce an environment of <Emphasis Type="Italic">ambiguity</Emphasis>. The organization may have good intentions in terms of welcoming diversity, but may fall short of achieving the full benefits of a diverse workforce because diversity management is assumed rather than being proactively attended to. Inclusion is a necessary but not a sufficient element of true multiculturalism. Meares et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002461">2004</CitationRef>) noted how ambiguous policies kept employees from clearly understanding the organization’s expectations. This resulted in the continuation of mistreatment of minorities, as well as the continuation of a majority/minority gap. Furthermore, when this ambiguity is reflected in poorly defined roles (i.e., role ambiguity), workers’ motivation, performance, commitment and, more importantly, mental and physical health are negatively affected (Örtqvist &amp; Wincent, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002470">2006</CitationRef>). Limited management of diversity initiatives might also lead to a <Emphasis Type="Italic">reactive</Emphasis> environment where organizations spend a great deal of time problem solving and developing solutions that occur after the fact, but fail to actually resolve the central issue. For example, organizations may develop diversity training that informs employees about respecting diversity, yet never assess the alignment between the training and the goals of diversity programs. If the goal is to fully integrate the workforce, training that teaches respect and awareness may not be enough. Research has noted how diversity training initiatives typically fail due to conventional attitudes towards diversity issues (Chavez &amp; Weisinger, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002415">2008</CitationRef>). Although an important element in ensuring a fully integrated environment is the effort made to align and manage diversity initiatives, such as employee training and selection, this effort should not be confined to diversity initiatives only, but something that should be instilled within the organization’s core functions.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A true multicultural organization is characterized by the full integration of cultural differences. Individuals’ various points of view are valued and, even more importantly, are considered vital resources that aid in the organization’s learning and overall functioning (Ely &amp; Thomas, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002427">2001</CitationRef>). To be successful in achieving a multicultural organization, management must be committed to ensuring that, to greatest extent possible, all employees who want to be involved in organizational events, such as decision making and information and knowledge sharing, are encouraged to do so (McMahan, Bell, &amp; Virick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002460">1998</CitationRef>; Wood &amp; Wall, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0024101">2007</CitationRef>). Grawitch and colleagues (Grawitch, Trares, &amp; Kohler, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002438">2007</CitationRef>; Grawitch, Ledford, Ballard, and Barber, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002439">2009</CitationRef>) note that employee involvement influences various indicators of employee physical and psychosocial well-being, and organizational commitment. Given that inclusion has been shown to promote well-being, whereas exclusion has been shown to lower well-being (Mor-Barak &amp; Levin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002465">2002</CitationRef>), it might be argued that proactively promoting and encouraging diversity may be considered a healthy organizational practice. In the <Emphasis Type="Italic">integrative</Emphasis> environment, the goals for management will extend beyond implementing traditional diversity initiatives towards creating a shared organizational identity. Nahavandi and Malekzadeh (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002468">1988</CitationRef>) note that a shared organizational identity is where everyone belongs to the same social group (i.e., the organization) while, at the same time, each individual is allowed to retain his/her own cultural identity. Rather than suppressing individuality which leads to increased stress levels, unique perspectives are encouraged because the more ideas generated, the greater the likelihood of more creative solutions (Lauring, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0024103">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Tetrick and Quick (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002489">2011</CitationRef>) provide insight into how organizations might move toward true ­multiculturalism. For example, changing the organization’s culture might be considered a primary intervention (i.e., prevention before people are at risk). Quite often, organizations implement change programs out of a desire to keep up with current trends yet, over time, these initiatives will lose momentum because the crux of the issue has not been addressed. If multiculturalism in its truest sense is desired and possible in an organization, successful culture change will start with top management and an assessment of the potential barriers to successful diversity integration (e.g., embedded beliefs and values). Rather than an organizational culture being defined by the physical or cultural characteristics of the leaders and founders, organizations can change the culture so that it is driven by the organization’s mission and goals. The main focus of any organization should be on achieving its goals. An integrated, multicultural organization should be guided by the goals that reflect the objectives, mission, and strategies. This, in turn, will help to reduce and even eliminate the majority/­minority gap and move employees toward a shared organizational identity. However, the major shift in organizational thinking is not without its challenges. The strength of the multicultural organization is in its ability to draw upon diverse perspectives. If not managed effectively, the organization’s ability to capitalize on that strength may be threatened. Leaders will have to manage employee involvement and participation by not allowing one group to dominate over another. At the same time, leaders will need to ensure that employees are allowed to retain their individual cultural identity. People who feel they must hide their own cultural uniqueness will be less willing to share information, whereas those who feel valued and respected for their competence will be more willing to contribute (Ely &amp; Thomas, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002427">2001</CitationRef>). Full contribution and participation by employees is what differentiates the multicultural organization from all others. Therefore, one challenge for the multicultural organization will be the balancing act between uniting people to the goals of the organization, while at the same time respecting the differences among individual cultures.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Inherent to this atmosphere of open dialogue, another challenge will be for leaders to manage the inevitable conflict that naturally occurs when different perspectives are allowed to emerge. Tense discussions are likely, but will be expressed by disagreements based on differences of opinion and not based on the characteristics of the individual. The multicultural organization encourages this type of open communication because it serves to expand the organization’s overall learning. In this regard, training initiatives on specific topics, such as effective communication and managing conflict, are likely to be more successful because the training’s purpose and the goals of the organization are aligned. Moreover, learning will not stop once training is over, but will continue outside of the training room because the behaviors and attitudes will be expressed consistently throughout the organization. For organizations that wish to adopt a multicultural perspective, a final challenge will be a potential change to the existing organizational culture. Due to the deeply held, embedded beliefs and values, changing an organization’s culture is difficult, yet not impossible. The reciprocal influence between an organization’s culture and its policies and practices as noted previously represents a starting point for organizations. Redefining what is considered acceptable behaviors and attitudes on the job can be achieved through enacting new policies. By frequently communicating these new policies, and having management at all levels of the organization consistently model desired practices and behaviors, over time culture change can occur.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Issues associated with organizational diversity have existed long before the recent appeal was made by occupational health psychologists to focus on total organizational health. Moreover, in recent times, the literature has clearly articulated the potential benefits of a culturally diverse workforce. If organizations wish to capitalize on these benefits, the framework presented here can be used as a starting point for organizations to assess the alignment among objectives, mindset, and practices. Merely acquiring individuals from diverse backgrounds, without providing a foundation that supports their success, will not produce the desired results. Even for those organizations with the best intentions, this strategy will eventually prove detrimental to the health and well-being of both the workers and the organization.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In 1996, the call for valuing differences in the workplace was made by Fine, who described how the organizational mindset at that time was starting to shift from suppression of women and minorities to awareness. A decade and a half later, it would seem another shift is in order: from awareness of differences to the active promotion and integration of diversity into the organization’s core functioning. The organization that proactively embraces this shift will certainly be in a better position to realize the full benefits that have been promised from implementing a diverse workforce. The heart of the matter lies with the overall values of the organizational that perpetuates established behaviors. Thus, whether organizations support or block the establishment of healthy workplace practices, such as integrating diversity, will be based on its underlying mindset, as this will be the ultimate determinant of success and sustainment over the long term.</Para>

              <Heading>Future Research Directions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">As organizations become more diverse, interest in the relationships among culture, gender, and occupational health will continue to grow. To meet the future demands from both practitioners and academics, researchers will have to develop and test more integrative, mechanistic models that can account for these relationships. Currently, support for the associations is indirect; there is strong evidence that culture influences organizational behavior, such as conflict at work and perceptions of fairness, and that these psychosocial factors, in turn, influence workers’ physical and mental health. However, the complete models and the specific pathways have not been fully examined. Future research is required to determine how the organization’s mindset and practices combine to produce the various environments, and result in organizational changes that affect individuals’ health. The knowledge resulting from this type of research will be critical for the identification of specific organizational practices that can be the target for modification.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">This work will require further specification and clarification of the terms used and constructs examined. As indicated above, there is still great confusion about the meaning and in the usage of key concepts such as culture, ethnicity, race, gender, and sex. A strong and useful theoretical body requires specific explanations which can only be achieved by increasing the rigor in the use and measurement of these terms. For instance, using race as a proxy for ethnicity or culture will most likely hinder the understanding of a phenomenon, as skin color does not tell us anything about the specific aspects of culture that may influence organizational behaviors and occupational health. However, if one is attempting to understand how individuals’ perceptions of coworkers may affect conflict at work, this may require the use of race as a descriptor of the ways in which individuals categorize coworkers. Something similar is required when sex and gender are the focus of studies. Women or men may experience differential health outcomes because of culturally prescribed roles (e.g., type of job one chooses) or because of sex-based discrimination.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">These recommendations also require that greater attention is paid to the quality of measurement. Specifically, it is critical that researchers test the assumption that the instruments are measuring the same construct, and in the same way (i.e., measurement invariance) for all groups (e.g., countries, ethnicity, or sex). Group comparisons or the examination of group differences in psychosocial processes across groups will result in biased results in the absence of measurement invariance. Psychometric research needs to be more closely integrated into the work conducted by researchers and practitioners to ensure the validity of inferences.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The road ahead is challenging but has the potential to be extremely rewarding for both researchers and practitioners. This will be especially true if investigators can produce knowledge about organizational processes that can be used by managers to enact changes to improve their organizations.</Para>
