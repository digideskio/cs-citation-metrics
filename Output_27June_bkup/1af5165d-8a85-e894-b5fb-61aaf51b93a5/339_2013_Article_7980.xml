              <Para>Nanoscale periodic rifts and subwavelength ripples as well as randomly nanoporous surface structures were generated on Si(100) surfaces immersed in water by tightly focused high-repetition rate sub-15 femtosecond sub-nanojoule pulsed Ti:sapphire laser light. Subsequent to laser processing, silicon oxide nanoparticles, which originated from a reaction of ablated silicon with water and aggregated on the exposed areas, were etched off by hydrofluoric acid. The structural phases of the three types of silicon nanostructures were investigated by transmission electron microscopy diffraction images recorded on focused ion beam sections. On nanorift patterns, which were produced at radiant exposure extremely close to the ablation threshold, only the ideal Si-I phase at its original bulk orientation was observed. Electron diffraction micrographs of periodic ripples, which were generated at slightly higher radiant exposure, revealed a compression of Si-I in the vertical direction by 6 %, which is attributed to recoil pressure acting during ablation. However, transitions to the high-pressure phase Si-II, which implies compression in the same direction at pressures in excess of 10 GPa, to the metastable phases Si-III or Si-IV that arise from Si-II on pressure relief or to other high-pressure phases (Si-V–Si-XII) were not observed. The nanoporous surfaces featured Si-I material with grains of resolidified silicon occurring at lattice orientations different from the bulk. Characteristic orientational relationships as well as small-angle grain boundaries reflected the rapid crystal growth on the substrate.</Para>

              <Para>Laser-induced structural phase transitions of silicon are of technological importance in areas such as microelectronics, micro and nanooptics, microelectromechanical systems, and material processing. For instance, pulsed-laser crystallization of amorphous silicon films is a key step in the production of polycrystalline Si thin film transistors with applications in active-matrix liquid crystal displays and organic light emitting displays [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Metallic silicon high-pressure phases feature different electronic and optical properties, which may be exploited in microoptical devices, whereas sensing microdevices may benefit from local changes in chemical reactivity and adsorbance. Laser-induced differences in hardness, stiffness, and abrasiveness may improve the performance of micromechanical systems and of templates for nanoimprint lithography. Phase transformations may influence the precision and morphology of fine laser cuts in the silicon material.</Para>
              <Para>Laser ablation by ultrashort pulses can produce structural phases of materials different from the bulk of the exposed target not only via redeposition of ablated atoms, ions, and clusters, but also by transforming the irradiated target itself [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. Pulsed-laser deposited thin and ultrathin films can exist in an amorphous or a metastable crystalline phase as, for example, low temperatures or high deposition rates may prevent the formation of equilibrium phases. Likewise, on the irradiated target, amorphization may be caused by melting and rapid resolidification or by bond-breaking in the solid material. Metastable phases may be generated by preservation of high-temperature phases on fast cooling or of high-pressure phases on fast pressure relief. Stress due to rapid thermal expansion, but also Coulomb explosions or lattice destabilization by high concentrations of excited electrons, which are athermal ablation processes, may leave part of the substrate in high-pressure phases. At subpicosecond pulse lengths, the electronic and lattice systems of the target are not in thermal equilibrium during laser excitation. A dense electron-hole plasma is generated as a prerequisite of ablation involving a small concentration of seed carriers, and further increase in the plasma concentration by collisional excitation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. As seed carriers can readily be provided by defects or generated by one- or two-photon excitation of valence band electrons, silicon has a relatively low breakdown threshold for excitation by near-infrared laser pulses. Its damage threshold of roughly 200 mJ/cm<Superscript>2</Superscript> in air was found only weakly dependent on pulse length and pulse number in the range of 5 fs to 400 fs [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>] in agreement with a single-pulse ablation threshold of 150 mJ/cm<Superscript>2</Superscript> measured with 150 fs-pulses [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. In contrast, an ablation threshold of 60 and 85 mJ/cm<Superscript>2</Superscript> was observed on multipulse excitation in water at pulse lengths of 12 fs and 310 fs, respectively [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. Usually, low-repetition rate amplified laser systems were used for such ablation experiments [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. However, as in the tight focal spot of a high-numerical aperture (NA) objective threshold fluences can readily be obtained, high-repetition rate near-infrared oscillators also facilitated surface nanostructure formation using nanojoule [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>] or even subnanojoule pulse energies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. The most prominent laser-induced surface structures on silicon were wavelength-period [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>] and subwavelength-period ripples [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>] as well as more complex patterns such as nanocone assemblies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. Recently, phase transitions on Si(100) surfaces were studied, which were induced in ultrahigh vacuum on ripple structures of period 200 nm and 600–700 nm as well as on submicrometer-size spikes by several thousand pulses of low-repetition rate 100-fs 800-nm Ti:sapphire laser light at a fluence slightly below the single-pulse ablation threshold [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. In the ripple zone, Raman spectra revealed body-centered cubic and rhombohedral phases of silicon (Si-III, Si-XII) as well as amorphous silicon, whereas the spike-like areas, which arose from more intense illumination, featured plenty of amorphous silicon, but less metastable allotropes. The ripples consisted of distorted crystalline silicon rich of defects with amorphous silicon in the hollows between the ripples, but an allocation of specific crystalline phases by electron microscopy failed [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. In the light of these studies, it is worthwhile to investigate the structural phases that emerge when ablation is performed using different ambient media, as highly excited material may interact differently or react chemically with the adjacent medium. For example, ripples of period 150 nm and 400 nm were produced by 100-fs pulses with water on the silicon surface without the requirement to etch off a substantial amount of laser-induced oxide [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. They were attributed to the existence of an amorphous surface layer of several tens of nanometers thickness generated by incubation prior to ablation. The pulse length may also exert an influence on the formation of structural phases. For instance, multipulse ablation at sub-single pulse threshold fluence levels was not observed at pulse lengths significantly shorter than 100 fs indicating the absence of significant material changes prior to the onset of ablation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. In contrast, at longer pulse lengths, an incubation coefficient of 0.84 was determined.</Para>
              <Para>Here, we present an analysis of structural phases of different kinds of nanostructures, which were generated on Si(100) surfaces covered by water using tightly focused high-repetition rate sub-15 femtosecond sub-nanojoule pulsed 800-nm Ti:sapphire laser light. At radiant exposure close to the ablation threshold nanorift patterns and subwavelength periodic ripple patterns were produced at an orientation perpendicular to the laser polarization, whereas at exposure well beyond the ablation threshold randomly nanoporous surfaces were obtained. Subsequent to laser processing, silicon oxide nanoparticles, which originated from reaction of ablated silicon with water and aggregated on the processed areas, were removed by hydrofluoric acid etching. Structural phases were investigated by transmission electron microscopy diffraction images recorded from focused ion beam sections. On nanorift patterns only the ideal Si-I phase at its original bulk orientation was observed, whereas periodic ripples revealed a compression of Si-I in the vertical direction by 6 %, which is attributed to the recoil pressure during the ablation process. The nanoporous surfaces featured Si-I material comprising grains of resolidified silicon at lattice orientations different from the bulk, but with well-defined orientational relationship indicating rapid crystal growth on the substrate. Silicon high-pressure phases (Si-II–Si-XII) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>] were not detected, and there was also no evidence of substantial laser-induced amorphization.</Para>

                <Para>The setup for nanostructure generation on Si(100) surfaces is shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>. A broadband mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (Integral Pro 400, FemtoLasers, Vienna, 730–850 nm) provided transform-limited 10-fs pulses at an average power of 400 mW with repetition rate <Emphasis Type="Italic">R</Emphasis>=85 MHz. The pulses were prechirped by multiple reflections from chirped mirrors as well as passage through an adjustable glass double wedge in order to compensate for the group velocity dispersion of the subsequent microscope optics, thereby largely restoring their original length in the focal spot. The laser beam passed a shutter, a polarizer-based attenuator as well as a combination of a half-wave and a quarter-wave plate for polarization control. Thereafter, it was deflected by a pair of galvanometric scan mirrors and expanded by a 6:1 telescope. Finally, the beam entered an inverted Zeiss AxioObserver.D1 microscope, where it was focused onto the sample by a Zeiss EC Plan Neofluar 40× NA 1.3 oil immersion objective. As verified by an interferometric autocorrelator (Femtometer, FemtoLasers), the pulse length achieved in the microscope focus was <Emphasis Type="Italic">τ</Emphasis>=12 fs. A piezoelectric translation stage facilitated vertical adjustment of the focal spot. Stray light from the sample surface was monitored by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera through a dichroic mirror, which filtered the reflected laser light. Coarse positioning of the samples was achieved using a motorized lateral translation stage. Further details on sub-15 fs laser microscopy and its applications were published recently in a comprehensive review [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

Transform-limited 10 fs pulses are prechirped by multiple reflections at chirped mirrors followed by a double wedge. After intensity and polarization control, the beam is scanned across the sample by a galvanometric scanner, which is part of an inverted microscope. Homogeneous illumination of the back aperture of the numerical aperture (NA) 1.3 oil immersion objective is ensured by a 6:1 telescope. The silicon samples are mounted on top of an object carrier with a thin film of water between the surface and the glass coverslip.

A glass coverslip of thickness 170 μm was put on top of the silicon surface leaving a small gap of approximately 10 μm in depth, which was filled with water and then sealed with some glue. Besides its function as reactive medium, the water film reduced aberrations of the focal spot caused by refractive index mismatch.

                <Para>Subsequent to laser processing the wafer pieces were cleaned by acetone in an ultrasonic bath and examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in an FEI Helios Nanolab DualBeam 600 SEM/FIB workstation for a first check of the quality of the nanostructures and to assess the amount of silicon oxide nanoparticles deposited on the structures. Thereafter, all of the oxide was removed by etching in 6 % hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes, and the samples were investigated by SEM once more. In order to study the structure of the nanopatterns in all three dimensions by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), (110)-oriented lamellae were prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) milling. To this end, on each of the samples listed in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef> a 250 nm thick platinum layer was deposited on a 30 μm×30 μm square followed by a central 5 μm wide patch of platinum of thickness 1.3 μm. At gallium ion beam energies of 30 keV silicon material was removed on both sides of the patch until thin lamellae remained, which were attached to TEM grids and further reduced in thickness to approximately 80 nm. In order to suppress surface amorphization by FIB milling, a final polish was applied at an ion beam energy of 5 keV. The TEM lamellae were monitored by SEM, and high-resolution TEM-images were recorded in a JEOL JEM2010 microscope at an electron energy of 200 keV. Electron diffraction patterns were recorded in the transmission electron microscope at selected places on and below the nanostructured surfaces using diaphragms of diameter down to 150 nm.</Para>

              <Para>At lowest exposure tiny rifts were observed on the Si(100) surface with an orientation perpendicular to the laser polarization. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>(a) shows an SEM top-view image of sample 1 with the TEM lamella cut perpendicular to the rifts as inset. The rifts occurred at a mean distance of roughly 130 nm with average depth and width of approximately 50 nm and 20 nm, respectively. Small grains of redeposited silicon material appear as white spots in the top view image ranging from 20 to 90 nm in size. The SEM image of the FIB section and also the TEM image in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>(b) did not reveal regions of different brightness indicating that the silicon material was homogeneous. Some faint contours directly at the interface are attributed primarily to superposition of silicon and deposited platinum occurring due to the finite thickness of the lamella. In the immediate vicinity of a typical rift, structural phases were investigated by TEM with the electron beam focused onto the position of the tip of the stop seen as black bar in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>(b). The inset shows the exposed area of diameter 150 nm directly beneath the rift, which was examined by electron diffraction. The diffraction pattern presented in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>(c) is an ideal bulk Si-I phase pattern as expected from the orientation of the lamella and the direction of the electron beam. The bright rings reveal some contributions by amorphous silicon. However, at lamella thicknesses below 100 nm amorphous silicon was also found at places, which had not been exposed to laser light (not shown). Therefore, diffraction images did not allow for a distinction to which extent laser irradiation or surface amorphization due to the ion beam caused these signals. The diffraction pattern resulting from the ideal bulk Si-I phase with the electron beam incident in the 〈110〉-direction is calculated readily using the Laue condition <InlineEquation ID="IEq1">

However, electron diffraction spot intensities are weak due to strong absorption, and significant signals were measured only on a limited number of mesh positions. Due to the strong interaction of electrons with the scattering nuclei diffracted waves are coupled exchanging energy among each other and, in addition, may undergo diffraction repeatedly [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>]. Therefore, the relative spot intensities were at large variation, and extinctions due to the geometrical structure factor were partly or totally ineffective. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig2">

              <Para>Slightly higher radiant exposure resulted in subwavelength ripple patterns of a periodicity of approximately 150 nm. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>(a) shows a scanning electron microscope image of such ripples (sample 2), which in the average were 30–50 nm in width and 50–70 nm in height as demonstrated by the SEM image of a FIB section in the inset (right) and the TEM image of a selected ripple (left). Again, silicon appeared to be of homogeneous consistence without any signs of regions comprising different phases. However, the diffraction pattern shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>(b), which was recorded directly below the ripples using once more the 150 nm diaphragm, revealed significant deviations from the diffraction image of bulk crystalline Si-I taken 3 μm below the surface as a reference [Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>(c)]. The spots of the reference pattern occupy the regular Si-I bulk mesh positions. The inset of Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>(c) shows the same pattern applying a <Emphasis Type="Italic">γ</Emphasis>-correction in order to emphasize the weaker spots not resolved otherwise. There were again spots on mesh positions ruled out by the geometrical structure factor, which are labeled in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>(c) by small squares. For example, the (−2 2 2)-spot was observed as a result of secondary diffraction of the relatively intense (−1 1 1)-beam, although it is forbidden by kinematic theory due to destructive interference of contributions from atoms a quarter of the unit cell space diagonal apart. In contrast, directly beneath the chosen ripple the diffraction spots shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>(b) still occupied the Si-I positions in the lateral direction (wave vector component Δ<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>
                <Subscript>||</Subscript>), but in the vertical direction (Δ<Emphasis Type="Italic">k</Emphasis>
                <Subscript>
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">z</Emphasis>
                </Subscript>) they were shifted by approximately 6 %. Due to their faint appearance, some of the spots are marked by an arrow. The observed shift reflects a compression of the Si-I phase in the vertical direction, which from the Young modulus in the 〈100〉-direction of 130 GPa [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>] implies an inherent compression stress of 8 GPa. The radiation pressure of approximately 0.3 GPa exerted by the laser beam in the focal spot of diameter 375 nm during the pulse duration of 12 fs did not reach such a level, but the recoil pressure of material ejected within picoseconds from the thin plasma layer of roughly 20 nm thickness [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>] could. However, such uniaxial stress is still below the Si-I–Si-II transition pressure of 10 GPa [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>]. We checked that none of the well-known silicon high-pressure phases Si-II–Si-XII features a tetragonal lattice with lattice parameters resulting in a reciprocal lattice matching the observed diffraction spots. This holds in particular for the body-centered tetragonal Si-II phase [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>], which corresponds to Si-I after strong compression in the c-direction [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>], but also for the tetragonal phases Si-VIII and Si-IX, which may arise from the body-centered orthorhombic Si-XI phase on fast relief from the pressure range 13–16 GPa [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>]. Apparently, the body-centered cubic Si-III phase [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>], which emerges from Si-II on pressure relief, and the hexagonal diamond phase Si-IV [<CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>], which is generated on heating of Si-III by a Martensitic transition with the (0001)-axis parallel to the Si-I (110)-direction [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>], were also not observed. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig3">

              <Para>At radiant exposure well above the ablation threshold a randomly nanoporous surface structure persisted subsequent to laser scanning. In Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef>(a), the SEM images in top-view perspective and of the FIB section as inset show such an arrangement (sample 3). The lateral and vertical dimensions of structural elements were tens of nanometers. Nanopores of typical diameters of 10–20 nm penetrated the surface with empty space existing also underneath silicon material. The electron diffraction patterns strongly depended on the position at the surface. The place marked in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef>(b) by the end of the stop revealed the diffraction pattern shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef>(d), which corresponded perfectly to ideal Si-I bulk material. In addition to amorphous contributions, a ring system appeared due to the platinum layer deposited on top of the surface (marked by concentric circles). However, at the second place shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef>(c) a much more complex diffraction pattern was observed [Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef>(e)]. At the (1 −1 1)-, (2 −2 0)-, (4 −4 0)-, and (3 −3 1)-type Si-I bulk mesh positions spots appeared, some of which were split indicating Si-I domains of different orientation. In addition, the diffraction image comprised Si-I patterns, which were rotated counterclockwise by 5° (marked by small solid circles around the spots) as well as clockwise by 57° (triangles) and 30° (squares) with respect to the bulk Si-I mesh. The outermost spots resulted from clockwise rotation by approximately 90° (long-dashed circles) and 105° (short-dashed circles). The big concentric circles around the centre of the pattern connect the diffraction spots with their original mesh positions. Thus, a multitude of low- and high-angle grain boundaries was established along the rather chaotic nanoporous surface. The regular orientation of these crystallites demonstrates that silicon material resolidified on the surface with well-defined growth directions rather than being redeposited as grains of ablated material from the water film that covers the sample. These findings agree with our observation that ablated silicon reacted with water and was redeposited on the surface as oxide, which could readily be etched off by hydrofluoric acid. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig4">

              <Para>Three different types of nanostructures were generated on Si(100) surfaces immersed in water using tightly focused sub-15 fs pulsed high-repetition rate 800-nm Ti:sapphire laser light: periodic nanorifts and ripples as well as randomly nanoporous surface patterns. The applied fluences were comparable in magnitude and slightly exceeded the (multipulse) threshold fluence of 60 mW/cm<Superscript>2</Superscript> [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. The number of pulses per site, and hence the radiant exposure made the difference, as it varied by two orders of magnitude from rifts to ripples and further to nanoporous structures. In the ablation process, silicon oxide nanoparticles were produced, which covered the illuminated areas densely and were etched off by hydrofluoric acid. As evidenced by TEM diffraction patterns, laser processing left the surface in its original Si-I phase as long as nanorifts were produced at lowest radiant exposure with only very little material ablated. The continuous periodic ripple patterns, which arose from longer exposure, featured strong compression stress perpendicular to the surface. Tentatively, it is attributed to an enrichment of defects accumulated on prolonged exertion of recoil pressure and rapid cooling, which preserved the deformation after the illumination was finished. In contrast, the nanoporous structures, which consisted of largely isolated structural elements, facilitated melting due to heat accumulation, as heat was not conducted easily to the bulk. Therefore, resolidification resulted in small and largely undistorted grains of Si-I, which grew from the melt comparatively slowly at well-defined orientations with respect to the bulk. Amorphous silicon did not conglomerate in regions of substantial size as evidenced by the homogeneous appearance of silicon in the TEM images for all of the nanostructures, but diffraction images revealed a substantial amount of surface amorphization of the FIB sections. The absence of high-pressure phases cannot be attributed to the lower pulse energy in our experiments as compared to [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>] and [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>], as similar fluences were applied. However, incubation by defect formation and amorphization in the early stages of exposure played a significant role in their experiments, which were performed with 100-fs pulses below the single-pulse ablation threshold. Possibly, the ablation of amorphous material pressurized the adjacent crystalline silicon stronger than ejection of originally crystalline material, which prevailed close to rifts and ripples at sub-15 fs exposure. Most likely, water as the ambient medium also had a profound influence on the structural composition. Massive excitation and heating did not only result in ablation of silicon followed by oxide particle formation in the surrounding water film, but presumably water vapor also oxidized the highly excited surface, thereby preventing the formation of silicon high-pressure phases or eliminating them once generated. Accordingly, as the formation of silicon oxide varied locally on prolonged exposure, a randomly nanoporous surface structure with hollows covered by silicon material was laid bare after etching. As compared to oxygen from the air, water as reactive medium is advantageous, because the thin vapor layer directly on the silicon surface features a higher pressure and hence a higher density, thereby intensifying the oxidation process. In conclusion, the structural phases generated on ultrashort pulsed laser-induced nanostructure formation on silicon surfaces strongly depend on illumination conditions such as the pulse length and on ambient media used. High-pressure phases or traceable amounts of laser-induced amorphous silicon were not observed in the absence of significant incubation and an environment containing reactive compounds.</Para>
