          <Para ID="Par1">Stroke is a disease with very high socio-economic impact. In average, the healthcare expenditure cost for Strokes across different countries in Europe and the USA is 3 % of their entire healthcare expenditure. This includes inpatient treatment cost, outpatient hospital visits and long-term rehabilitation and care. Analysis showed that costs of long-term care have increased from 13 to 49 % of overall costs in average in recent years. Therefore, there is an urgent need for devising an effective long-term care and rehabilitation strategy for Stroke patients, which involves patients actively in the process while minimising costly human intervention.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par2">Later, we describe main motivation behind pursuing research and development work on rehabilitation of stroke patients using an automated remote rehabilitation system by blending advances of ICT and practical clinical knowledge in order to empower the patients and their immediate care takers for effective application of the rehabilitation in home settings. The discussion further describes the state-of-the-art in research and development, signals similar systems already available on the market, concluding with identification of the potential impact of systems like StrokeBack and similar ones in European and worldwide perspectives.</Para>

          <Para ID="Par3">Stroke is hitting about two million [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>] people per year in Europe. For these people, the effect of stroke is that they lose certain physical and cognitive abilities at least for a certain time period. More than one third of these patients, i.e. more than 670,000 people return to their home with some level of permanent disability, leading to a significant reduction of quality of life which affects not only the patients themselves but also their relatives.</Para>

          <Para ID="Par8">Therefore, there is a strong need to improve ambulant care model, in particular, at the home settings, involving the patients into the care pathway, for achieving maximal outcome in terms of clinical as well as quality of life. In addition to the dramatic effect of stroke for individuals, it has strong impact on our society as well. The total cost of stroke in the EU was calculated to be over 38 billion in 2006. This figure included healthcare costs (about 49 % of total cost), productivity loss due to disability and death (23 % of total cost) and informal care costs (29 % of total cost).</Para>
          <Para ID="Par9">The prevalence of ageing in the European societies is expected to lead to an increased number of people suffering from stroke. For example, [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>] predicts that the number of stroke patients in Hessen, Germany; should increase from 20,846 in 2005 to more than 35,000 in 2050 which equals to an increase of nearly 70 % within the next four decades. The German Aerztezeitung predicts an increase of even 2.5 times is predicted leading to an enormous pressure on the healthcare systems in terms of cost. The effect on the healthcare cost might be even more significant since as the current trend suggest the ratio of young and healthy persons to elderly persons also decrease, so that the informal care cost might be shrinking and thereby directly leading to increased direct healthcare cost. This may become a burden for economies.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par10">The StrokeBack project addresses both of the sketched problem areas. The goal of the project is the development of a telemedicine system which supports ambulant rehabilitation at home settings for the stroke patients with minimal human intervention. With StrokeBack the patients can do rehabilitation in their own home where they feel psychologically better than in care centres. In addition, the contact hours with a physiotherapist can be reduced leading to a direct reduction of healthcare cost. By ensuring proper execution of physiotherapy trainings in an automated guided way modulated by appropriate clinical knowledge and in supervised way only when necessary, StrokeBack empowers the patients to exercise much more and at better quality than it is possible today. By that StrokeBack improves rehabilitation speed, and quality of life of the patient. This leads also to the reduction of indirect healthcare cost as well. The StrokeBack concept is complemented by a Patient Health Record (PHR), in which training measurements and vital data of the patients is stored. Thus, the PHR provides all necessary information medical and rehabilitation experts need to evaluate rehabilitation success, e.g. to deduce relations between selected exercises and rehabilitation speed of different patients, as well as to assess the overall healthiness of the patient. In addition, PHR is used to provide the patient with mid-term feedback, e.g. rehabilitation speed compared to average and improvements over last day/weeks, keeping patient motivation high.</Para>
          <Section2 ID="Sec2">
            <Heading>Scientific and Technical Objectives</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par11">The StrokeBack project aims at increasing the rehabilitation speed of stroke patients while patients are in their own home. The benefit we expect from our approach is twofold. Most patients feel psychologically better in their own environment than in hospital and also rehabilitation speed is improved. In addition, we aim at exploiting the increased motivation of patients when exercising with a tool similar to a gaming console. The ability of doing high-quality exercises without the need of being monitored by a physiotherapist helps to reduce healthcare cost through minimisation of expensive human contact hours. Currently, the quantity of hours performing occupational (ergo-therapeutic) and physiotherapeutic sessions are restricted to payable effort for patient’s accommodation, transport or visit of therapists in patient’s home. StrokeBack aims at providing new technical means and service structures to enable patients to enhance their healthiness by increasing the number of training sessions.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par12">Very recently gaming consoles have gained a lot of attention when being used in the area of rehabilitation. All publications report on very good results in terms of speed of the rehabilitation process and especially patient motivation. A first evaluation has shown that even though the majority of the publications deal with ‘normal’ rehabilitation process, e.g. after surgery, that similar results hold true for stroke patients as well [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. But most of the published articles about and envisioned applications for computer-aided rehabilitation of patients have revealed one major drawback. Since these approaches target to train fine motor skills only, they require the patients to already possess, or have recovered up to, a certain level of mobility [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. By that, these solutions cannot be applied to patients having limited mobility such as spasticity or partial palsy what is the major issue for patients affected by stroke. These patients cannot be asked to hold a sensing device by hand or to exercise by stand. In contrast to that, StrokeBack aims to already assist in early stage of rehabilitation enabling highly affected patients to profit from our proposed monitoring system as well. Our system is designed for ambulant use and targets to be adjustable to the abilities of the patient—a patient-centric approach. For example, it can be used by hemiplegic, paretic patients as well as wheelchair users, too. By that we intend to shorten the full time, stationary rehabilitation and treatment programme and allow patients to be reintegrated into normal life as early as possible.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par13">The StrokeBack concept puts the patient into the centre of the rehabilitation process. It aims at exploiting the fact the patients feel better at home that it has been shown that patients train more if the training is combined with attractive training environments. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1.1</InternalRef> illustrates how we think the vision of such a patient-centric approach can come true. First, the patients learn the physical rehabilitation exercises from a therapist at the care centre or in a therapist’s practice (left part of Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1.1</InternalRef>). Then, the patients do the exercises at home (middle part of Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1.1</InternalRef>) and the StrokeBack system monitors their execution and provide real-time feedback on whether the execution was correct or not. In addition, it records the training results and vital parameters of the patient. These data is then analysed by medical experts (lower right part of Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1.1</InternalRef>) for assessment of the patient recovery. The patient also gets mid-term feedback on his/her personal recovery process. In order to ensure proper guidance of the patient also the therapist gets the information from the PHR to assess the recovery process and decide whether other training sequences should be used, which are then introduced to the patient in the practice again.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

</Para>
            <Para ID="Par19">In order to provide remote rehabilitation exercises at gold standard level, i.e. as good as in a face-to-face training with rehabilitation experts, we plan to exploit the advanced features of today’s body area networks (BAN). A BAN attached to the patient enables permanent monitoring of patients activity and vital parameters. We aim to monitor and record the patients’ activity enabling them to regularly, maybe daily, exercise independently from the guidance of the physical therapist. With a correct instrumentation, we expect to be able to detect also unwanted additional movements. In order to achieve a comparable monitoring by cameras, at least two of them need to be deployed at the patient’s home. This is a costly solution which also bears a privacy risk. Both issues can be solved with our BAN-based solution.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par20">As one possible application, the physical therapist has to look after the patient once a week only to exploit the level of rehabilitation, to analyse the results of last exercises based on recorded data and to take corrective action if necessary. Furthermore, a physical therapist may show new exercises and configure a new exercise schedule. By that, we intend to boost the rehabilitation process at home.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par21">The BAN can be worn by the patients throughout the whole day which enables us to compare actual movements in their daily life with the correct movement pattern define in rehabilitation exercises. To simplify the configuration process of the system, we analyse and evaluate self-learning techniques for exercise recognition, i.e. the StrokeBack system may learn the correct behaviour (patient’s movements) when exercises are carried out under instruction of the physical therapist.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par22">We aim to additionally evaluate a feasibility and requirements of using electronic personal health records to store and document recorded data and to remotely track the rehabilitation process, e.g. by the attending doctor. This includes the recordings done during rehabilitation exercises and during daily life. The recorded data is stored and can then be processed by healthcare professionals. The evaluation can be used to deduce detailed information of effects of individual exercises. This feedback can be used to select exercises for other patients, to assess effectiveness of exercises for specific groups of patients, etc. In addition, the vital parameters can be used to assess the healthiness of the patients which might even help to assess the probability of a further stroke.

The StrokeBack project follows this approach and aims at empowering stroke patients in doing physical therapy at home. It goes beyond the tele-assistance by implementing assessment features into the training equipment thus ensuring a correct execution of training sequences. This way it allows the patient to exercise more often than physical therapists are available. In addition, it provides an offline data to medical doctors as well as physical therapists to enable them to monitor their patients’ recovery process and evaluating the effect of selected training sequences.</Para>

In this context, the StrokeBack system consists of two major parts. One of them, the BAN tracks patient’s movements while a graphical HCI environment offers a virtual reality representation of rehabilitation exercises and the success level of the patient.</Para>

The BAN can be realised by using resource constraint wireless sensor nodes deployed at the body of the patient.

High level of accuracy is of movement detection is key for proper assessment of the exercises done by patients. This issue is tackled by using high-quality sensors, specific evaluation and calculation models and algorithms. The reliability of the system is enhanced by using an extra redundancy in the BAN. This is achieved by data replication in the BAN.</Para>

In addition, clinicians can evaluate the health state of patients on detail data over long-term period.</Para>

In order to comply with such needs, the second part of the StrokeBack system implements a custom PHS, allowing for offline/online evaluation of patient data based on web services and by that allow for closed-loop assessment and monitoring when necessary. The online evaluation may be used to provide personal feedback from the therapist to the patient while exercising. The data collected via the StrokeBack system enables medical and therapeutic experts to offline deduce relations between the training done by patients and the improvement of the patients’ health status. As result of this evaluation, the therapist might adapt the exercises or try to increase the patient’s motivation, i.e. if the requested number of training sessions was not done by the patient. The analysis of collected data offers an additional benefit in revealing interdependencies of specific exercises and rehabilitation success. When designing the StrokeBack system, standardised approaches were used as much as possible in order to ensure its architectural design for interoperability.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par33">The Strokeback system is an advanced system offering <Emphasis Type="Italic">education and motivation of users</Emphasis>. The project idea was partly influenced by the observation that patients who have been using gaming consoles as the WII were more motivated and exercised more than other patients. Hence, the project embedded the physical therapy training sequences into serious gaming applications. Furthermore, recording the number of executed exercises as well as the level of correctness allowed more accurate tracking of progress that the patients made. This has contributed to improving patients’ motivation, i.e. they can see that their effort has visible impact and this fact teaches patients indirectly since it shows them that proper exercising helps while laziness may lead to degradation of already achieved improvement.</Para>

StrokeBack has investigated security/privacy issues in order to ensure confidentiality and data integrity in all parts of the system and in all stages of processing. This means strong, but energy-efficient crypto-operations implemented for ensuring confidentiality of patients data while transmitting it wirelessly in the BAN. Privacy protection was also investigated for protecting patients’ privacy when their data is analysed by medical experts, who are not directly their leading physicians or physical therapists. In order to ensure user acceptance, patients who had indicated their consent to take part in the project were involved from the very beginning in the design process.</Para>

Progress beyond the state-of-the-art in each of those areas is detailed in the following subsections.</Para>

Such a system complying with the latest HL7 standard would allow seamless integration with hospital and private medical assistance service systems. Having WSDL web services as the main programming interface, it simplifies and enables the development of secure third party systems, services and applications built upon the core PHR database. A significant innovation is the API programming layer and similar scripting device integration interface allowing to avoid pre-installation of the device support for each medical devices within the device layer of the core system before users can use the device to upload measurement data to their PHR account. Furthermore, the PHR therapy definition has been extended to include physical training/exercises prescribed by the physician in the same way that other medicines are prescribed. The added advantage of such an approach is to provide data to physicians for assessing the effectiveness of the exercises against the changing patient’s condition. In order to do this reliably, the correctness of performing such exercises needs to be carefully monitored against predefined templates (temporal and spatial record of body movements and their frequency/retentiveness, treated each as a different therapy type).</Para>

The popularity of EHR/PHR systems has given rise to the development of open-source platform too [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>].

            <Heading>Tracing Body Movement</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par40">In order to enable the tracking, the correctness of performed exercises automatically without the constant assistance of the physicians, an automated means of tracking and comparing patient’s body movement against correct ones (templates) has been developed. Although many methods are in existence, most of them employ elaborate sets of wearable sensors and/or costly visual observations. In our project, we adopted initially visual-light scanning methods allowing computationally effective and cheap dynamic 3D object (in our case patient’s body) tracing. The idea was similar to laser scanning employed in the Kinect game interfaces for Xbox (now also available for Windows operating systems on PCs), but using specially designed images projected on the person. The part of the R&amp;D work was to determine if shifting to light wavelengths just beyond visible spectrum (infrared and ultraviolet) would allow achieving necessary accuracy and performance. Considering extremely small sizes of such sensors (less than 5 × 5 mm each) a development of lightweight wireless energy-autonomous (employing energy harvesting technologies) were possible, leading to the target sensor node form factor of a small sticker. Considering a vast amount of products appearing in the recent years, the Strokeback project has also taken advantage of such products, among them the Leap Motion IR sensor [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>], Emotiv EPOCH EEG sensor [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>], Myo EMG sensor [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>], etc.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par41">
<Emphasis Type="Italic">State-of-the-Art</Emphasis>: The need to monitor movement and activity both within and outside the laboratory has been the focus of considerable research over the last decade. Body-worn sensors such as goniometers [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>], pressure tubes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>], gyroscopes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>] and accelerometers [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>] have been used in a range of activities and clinical conditions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>] and for control of Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) in walking and upper limb movement [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>] and in standing with spinal cord injured patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>]. However, body-worn sensors are often bulky and require associated instrumentation and accurate placement of the sensor elements. Nevertheless, such studies have already demonstrated the feasibility and potential benefits of long-term monitoring of movement [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>] and what is needed now is a shift in approach to make this feasible and usable in clinical practice and particularly in the home environment for rehabilitation. Such an approach has already been embraced by the textile industry. The so-called smart textiles have been developed to measure vital signs, such as the Electrocardiogram (ECG), and have even been commercialised in, for example, the ProArmBand from SenseWear™ [<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>] or various systems from Vionetics [<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef>]. Predictions are that wearable systems become a part of routine clinical investigations [<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">39</CitationRef>]. Movement and muscle activity are, however, more challenging than vital signs and, in addition, processing, storing, transmitting and using the data poses an even greater challenge. The SMART project (funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the EQUAL initiative) has explored how technology can be used in the home to support rehabilitation following stroke. Devices have been developed that are attached to the wrist and upper arm using clothing resembling sportswear to give a measure of movements made by the patient in activities prescribed by the therapist. Data are recorded and displayed on a computer or TV screen. Joint angles have also been measured using conductive fibres integrated into fabric which change their resistance due to bending as the joint angle varies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>] and by covering the fabric with an electrically conductive elastomer with piezo-resistive properties so that when deformed acts as a strain sensor able to detect movement [<CitationRef CitationID="CR40">40</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par42">Muscle activity poses problems for measurement since it has been well known for many years [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>] that the EMG reflects effort rather than output and so becomes an unreliable indicator of muscle force as the muscle becomes fatigued. Consequently measurement of force, in addition to the EMG activity, would be a considerable step forward in assessing the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies and could not only indicate that fatigue is occurring, but also whether the mechanism is central or peripheral in origin [<CitationRef CitationID="CR42">42</CitationRef>]. Similarly, conventional surface EMG measurement requires accurate placement of the sensor over the target muscle, which would be inappropriate for a sensor system integrated within a garment for home use. Electrode arrays are, however, now being developed for EMG measurement and signal processing is used to optimise the signal obtained.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par43">Some of the building blocks for a body sensor network of the form proposed are therefore already in place. Existing commercial systems provide basic information about activity such as speed and direction of movement and postures. Providing precise information about performance, for example, relating movement to muscle activity in a given task and detecting deviations from normal, expected patterns or subtle changes associated with recovery, requires a much higher level of sophistication of data acquisition and processing and interpretation. The challenge is therefore to design and develop an integrated multimodal system along with high-level signal processing techniques and optimisation of the data extracted. The Kinect sensor has potential for use in haptic interfacing [<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef>] and software support has already been offered, while by Open Kinect Community [<CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>] and the official Kinect SDK programming support offered by Microsoft [<CitationRef CitationID="CR45">45</CitationRef>].</Para>

<Emphasis Type="Italic">Beyond State-of-the-Art</Emphasis>: The existing techniques for taking measurements on the human body are generally considered to be adequate for the purpose but are often bulky in nature and cumbersome to mount, e.g. electro-goniometers, and they can also be expensive to implement, e.g. Vicon camera system [<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">46</CitationRef>].

This is realised by the processing logic that is physically represented by the distributed system of nodes interconnected by (wireless) network means. All the features of this underlying system, like data handling middleware, compression, data aggregation or fusion, networking protocols and hardware architecture, help reaching the goals set by the primary aspect on different layers. Due to the small size of the network there is not really a need for sophisticated routing mechanisms. Thus, the MAC protocol becomes the central part of the networking.</Para>

The schedule of the access can also be created as a result of a contention phase. The main advantages of schedule-based protocols is that they provide more predictable communication latency important for Quality of Service (QoS) and allow duty-cycling, i.e. saving energy by switching the radio off while there is no communication planned for a particular node.</Para>

<Emphasis Type="Italic">State-of-the-Art</Emphasis>: There are several approaches that offer the data storage and management functionality in the field of sensor networks [<CitationRef CitationID="CR68">68</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR74">74</CitationRef>]. More specific approaches, i.e. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR75">75</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR78">78</CitationRef>] have been developed to ease the data handling in the application layer. They provide a middleware layer that abstracts the direct data and message exchange and simplifies the development of the processing logic module. TeenyLime [<CitationRef CitationID="CR75">75</CitationRef>] provides a possibility to share the data using a common set of tuples, available to the nodes in the network, i.e. every node can insert and remove a tuple to and from the shared set. The nodes can also be notified if a specific tuple is inserted into the set. In TinyDB [<CitationRef CitationID="CR77">77</CitationRef>], the network topology is a tree rooted at the central node that can order data from the sensor nodes on an on-demand or periodic basis, and the data is delivered down the tree. MacroLab [<CitationRef CitationID="CR76">76</CitationRef>] provides mechanisms to programme the network of nodes as a vector of data items. Such a global programme is then optimised for a chosen deployment platform and broken into individual programmes for the nodes. The tinyDSM [<CitationRef CitationID="CR78">78</CitationRef>] middleware provides a shared memory abstraction realised as a shared set of variables that can be defined as array with one item per node or as singletons. The former is similar to the vector in MacroLab, and the latter is similar to the tuple concept provided by TeenyLime. The tinyDSM is configurable to support the needs of the application and be optimal at the same time. It provides an event mechanism that notifies the application running on top of it in case a specified condition described using a logical equation with the shared variables as terms is fulfilled. It can be also extended to support security and privacy.</Para>

The middleware shall provide a consistent view of the data stored together with mechanisms to evaluate the data to detect abnormal events of a predefined character. This might be deviations from expected movements but also deviations of the vital parameters. The efforts are mainly put in the data consistency research and in the migration of the pure software approach to a combined SW/HW one.

              <Heading>Signal Processing in BAN</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par54">
<Emphasis Type="Italic">State-of-the-Art</Emphasis>: Medical data captured at the sensors require sophisticated signal processing for signal de-noising, artefact removal, signal classification and feature extraction. Wavelet Transform (WT), Kalman filtering and Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) are widely used for these purposes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR71">71</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR79">79</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR82">82</CitationRef>]. Approaches like Blind Source Separation (BSS), in particular Independent Component Analysis (ICA), has been used for accurately separating out the target signal from its artefacts and in its feature extraction [<CitationRef CitationID="CR83">83</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR84">84</CitationRef>]. However, all the methods (traditional and advanced) mentioned above, although accurate to clinical standards, are extremely demanding in terms of computation. Thus, in a traditional patient monitoring system owing to the lack of energy (in terms of battery power) at the sensor nodes, these processes are carried out on a more powerful computation platform like a central server or using an on-board microprocessor. Therefore under the continuous monitoring scenario, the sensors are used as data collectors only and the unconditioned data are continuously transmitted to the central station for further processing. This puts a huge burden on the wireless network owing to the plethora of data to be transmitted continuously. In addition, the continuous data transmission over long distance puts high energy demand on the analogue front-end of the embedded radio structure leading to fast draining of the battery.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par55">In addition to the regular signal processing tasks, in order to reduce the amount of data to be transmitted and; in the PREACTION system; to increase the on-sensor storage time-efficient data compression algorithm needs to be developed. Some data compression techniques provide an alternative to merely reducing the sampling frequency. These techniques can be characterised as either ‘lossy’ or ‘loss-less’. When data is compressed using a ‘loss-less’ method, it is possible to reconstruct the original waveform without losing information. Such non-distorting compression modes are exemplified by the Huffman coding method and the Lempel-Ziv method [<CitationRef CitationID="CR85">85</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR86">86</CitationRef>]. Loss-less compression modes are computationally expensive, resulting in a more complex circuit design, increased power consumption, and a longer data processing time. Moreover, the compression rate that is achieved depends on the content of the physiological signals. The content may vary depending on the physiological condition being monitored. As a result, the amount of memory needed to store the compressed data cannot be determined in advance. As an alternative to the use of a loss-less compression process, a lossy technique may be employed. Lossy techniques (SAPA or ‘fan’ method [<CitationRef CitationID="CR87">87</CitationRef>], Wavelets [<CitationRef CitationID="CR88">88</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR89">89</CitationRef>], Lifting Scheme WT or its combination with distributed source coding [<CitationRef CitationID="CR90">90</CitationRef>]) may require less processing power to implement. The resulting system may therefore be both smaller and more energy efficient. However, when data is compressed using a lossy method, some information is lost when the compressed data is later used to reconstruct the original waveform. However, owing to the required reliability in medical application it may not be always recommendable to use lossy compression.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par56">
<Emphasis Type="Italic">Beyond State-of-the-Art</Emphasis>: In contrast to the classical architecture of remote monitoring in our architecture, sophisticated signal processing is carried out within the BAN with an emphasis on medically trustworthy parameter extraction in order to reduce the burden on the network and transmission energy. Separate optimisation of signal processing algorithms and architecture cannot be applied here since this approach does not guarantee overall energy optimisation. Thus, a cooperative and holistic approach needs to be taken for increasing energy efficiency. Following this route in this part of the present proposal, we have developed novel energy optimal algorithms and architectures leading to an ultra-low-energy ASIC realisation for on-board signal de-noising, artefact removal and accurate feature extraction and classification. Especially, the latter allows measuring in real time how accurately the patient carries out the prescribed exercise from the data acquired by sensor nodes using low-complexity computer arithmetic.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par57">In our approach, the sensors send their captured raw signals over the BAN to the ASIC (which also is a part of the BAN) for data processing, and therefore continuous data (required when the patient is doing exercise) need to be transmitted only within the BAN leading to energy efficiency from the communication perspective as well in addition to that resulted from the proposed algorithm-architecture joint optimisation. In order to retain the best properties of lossy and lossless data compression techniques, an event-driven data compression technique has been developed in this research programme. Based on the information content of the physiological signal, the compression ratio is dynamically adjusted upon encountering a potentially abnormal event and thereby achieving high compression ratios under normal circumstances whereas preserving all the relevant clinical detail under potentially dangerous scenarios. A low-power VLSI architecture for such an event-driven data compression algorithm has been developed which is integrated with the on-sensor signal pre-processing architectures to devise a complete tailor-made ultra-low-power signal processing unit.</Para>

<Emphasis Type="Italic">State-of-the-Art</Emphasis>: Whereas many privacy and data protection means aim at a declarative approach only, there are limited approaches for technical protection. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two approaches [<CitationRef CitationID="CR91">91</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR92">92</CitationRef>] that try to make sensitive data available to a third party while ensuring secrecy of that data. The authors of [<CitationRef CitationID="CR92">92</CitationRef>] propose an architecture that ensures secure data processing by exploiting the Java sandbox model as an execution environment for data processing code and by limiting the feedback from the data processing code to the outside world. For correct interpretation of data processing results and the development of appropriate algorithms, a part of the data has to be publicly accessible. In addition, sensitive data are always kept at its owner’s site. The prerequisites of this concept render it impractical for implementation of location based or context-sensitive services, although it is well suited for privacy preserving data mining. The approach presented in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR91">91</CitationRef>] and in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR93">93</CitationRef>] tries to make user data inaccessible outside a specially secured execution environment. User data are enclosed in an agent and securely transferred into an isolated, closed-door, one-way platform provided by a trusted third party. The service agents proceed analogous with their own data. These entire agents interoperate within the trusted environment and agree on a certain result. The result is forwarded by each involved agent to the closed-door platform, which posts the result to the agents’ origins if the forwarded results are equal. This ensures that no private data is transmitted to the opposite party unless requested by the agent. All agents, together with their enclosed data, are deleted after service completion in order to ensure the privacy of the user and to protect service data.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par59">In [<CitationRef CitationID="CR94">94</CitationRef>] a publication of the IHP, a partner of the StrokeBack Consortium, the authors described a Privacy Guaranteeing Execution Container (PGEC) that does not rely on a trusted third party that provides processing capabilities, such as a server plus a specific agent platform. By design this container provides encapsulation of sensitive data and its deletion after service completion. Basically, the concept is that the application obtains access to the user data in a specially protected and certified environment, the PGEC. PGECs enable applications to access private user data and guarantee that the user data are deleted as soon as the service is quit. In a few words, they guarantee a ‘one-time use’ of the provided private data. The PGEC also restricts the communication between the application and the service provider to what is explicitly allowed by the service user.</Para>

That way we would enable a pre-processing of the arising data and a relevancy decision before sending it over a wide area network. In addition, we plan to extend its data access control means with a self-adaptive feature so that the data access can be adapted to the current medical conditions of the patient, i.e. in urgent medical conditions such as emergencies, treating medical staff might access gathered data that were usually privacy protected. In addition, we want to integrate it in the medical work flow so that anonymous studies and comparisons between various patients and treatment methods could be achieved within a network of containers.</Para>

ASP has been used in many application areas, among them, planning [<CitationRef CitationID="CR99">99</CitationRef>], product configuration [<CitationRef CitationID="CR100">100</CitationRef>], decision support [<CitationRef CitationID="CR101">101</CitationRef>], reasoning tools in systems biology [<CitationRef CitationID="CR102">102</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR103">103</CitationRef>], and many more. The success story of ASP has its roots in the early availability of ASP solvers. The ASP solver Clasp [<CitationRef CitationID="CR104">104</CitationRef>], developed in the KRR group of UP, demonstrates its performance and versatility by winning first places at international competitions like ASP’09, PB’09 and SAT’09. More related to the StrokeBack, a reactive reasoning engine based on ASP has already been developed by UP, a partner of the StrokeBack Consortium [<CitationRef CitationID="CR105">105</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par62">The BAN consists of many sensor nodes. In order to represent and reason on the data coming from sensors of BAN, one should fuse sensor data. Most commonly used methods for sensor fusion are quantitative approaches like Kalman and Particle Filters [<CitationRef CitationID="CR106">106</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR108">108</CitationRef>]. The main limitations of these methods are identifying good cost function to merge heterogeneous sensor data and dealing with situations like addition of new sensor devices or the presence of misbehaving devices. In [<CitationRef CitationID="CR109">109</CitationRef>] a publication of the UP, the authors used ASP for knowledge-intensive sensor fusion in the domain of localisation.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par63">
<Emphasis Type="Italic">Beyond State-of-the-Art</Emphasis>: In StrokeBack, we plan to integrate a knowledge-intensive representation scheme of rehabilitation exercises. The causal knowledge related to exercise movements and the complex relationship between parts of body are represented in an ASP paradigm. Knowledge-intensive representation compared to traditional quantitative methods is more transparent and elaboration tolerant. We plan to use these advantages for shortening the time required to represent exercises and more importantly, for making the whole representation more tolerant to changes and variations. The reactive reasoning engine performs decision based on live data originating from BAN and check whether the current movement is the expected one in the plan if the desired exercise. Additionally, since nodes in a BAN are limited devices in terms of computational power and energy, we want to design a modular representation so that the reasoning process and tools can be distributed into nodes.</Para>

            <Heading>Immersive Environments for Stroke Rehabilitation</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par64">The use of virtual, augmented and immersive environments for training and rehabilitation of post-stroke patients opens an attractive avenue in improving various negative effects occurring as a result of the brain trauma. Those include helping in recovering the motor skills, limb–eye coordination, orientation in space, everyday tasks, etc. Training may range from simple goal-directed limb movements, achieving a given goal (e.g. putting a coffee cup on a table), improving lost motor skills (e.g. virtual driving) and others. In order to increase the efficiency of the exercises advanced haptic interfaces, allowing direct body stimulation, are being developed to supplement visual stimulation.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par65">
<Emphasis Type="Italic">State-of-the-Art</Emphasis>: Immersive environments have quickly been found attractive for remote home-based rehabilitation giving raise to both individual and monitored by therapists remotely. Depending on the type of a physical interface, different types of exercises are possible. Interfaces like CyberGlove [<CitationRef CitationID="CR110">110</CitationRef>] or Rutgers RMII Master [<CitationRef CitationID="CR111">111</CitationRef>] allow the transfer of patient’s limb movement into the virtual gaming environment. They employ a set of pressure-sensing servos, one per finger, combined with motion sensing. This allows therapists to perform, e.g. range of motion, speed, fractionation (e.g. moving individual fingers) and strength (via pressure sensing) tasks. Games include two categories: physical exercises (e.g. Digi Key, Power Putty) and functional rehabilitation (e.g. Peg Board or Ball Game) ones. They use computer monitors for visual feedback. CyberGlove has been used by Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, also for assessing the pattern of finger movements during grasp and movement space determination for diverse stroke conditions. Virtual environments are increasingly used for functional training and simulation of natural environments, e.g. home, work, outdoor. Exercises may range from simple goal-directed movements [<CitationRef CitationID="CR112">112</CitationRef>] to learning/training the execution of everyday tasks.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par66">
<Emphasis Type="Italic">Beyond State-of-the-Art</Emphasis>: Current generation of post-stroke rehabilitation systems, although exploiting latest immersive technologies, tend to proprietary approaches concentrating on a closed range of exercise types, lacking thoroughly addressing the complete set of disabilities and offering a comprehensive set of rehabilitation scenarios. The use of technologies is also very selective and varies from one system to another. Although there are cases of using avatars for more intuitive feedback to the patient, the use of complicated wearable devices makes it tiresome and decreases the effectiveness of the exercise. In our proposal, we intend to explore novel technologies for body tracing that exploit the rich information gathered by combining wearable sensors, and visual feedback systems that are already commercially available (e.g. MS Kinect, Nintendo WII) We intend developing more advanced and potentially less expensive ones (e.g. visual-light 3D scanning). The immersive environment supports full 3D physical and visual feedback through Augmented Reality technologies placing the user inside of the training environment. Considering that detecting muscle activity cannot be done without wearable device support, we intend to develop a customisable lightweight embedded sensor device allowing short-range wireless transmission of most common parameters including apart from EMG, also other critical medical signs like ECG, Blood Pressure, heart rate, etc. Training exercises offer a more intuitive approach by using exercise templates with feedback showing correctness of performed exercises. Therapists are now able to prescribe a set of the rehabilitation exercises as treatment through the EHR/PHR thus offering means of correlating them with changes of patient’s condition, thus showing their effectiveness in patients’ recovery process.</Para>

          <Heading>Potential Impact in Europe and Worldwide</Heading>
          <Para ID="Par67">The StrokeBack system offers an opportunity for reducing the hospitalisation rate and improving disease management, treatment or rehabilitation at the point of need, through more precise assessment of health status.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par68">The StrokeBack system empowers patients to do physical rehabilitation training without the need of being supervised by a physical therapist. Even though this is mainly thought to support the rehabilitation process when patients are back at home, the StrokeBack system can be used in hospitals and rehabilitation centres as well. Since the StrokeBack system allows the patient to exercise more often than with systems used by now, patients recover faster than today and can be released from hospital or rehabilitation centre earlier than today. The fact that the StrokeBack training exercises are embedded into a kind gaming application has a significant positive impact on the motivation of patients to do the training sequences, which also contributes to improve rehabilitation speed. In addition, the StrokeBack system records the patients’ vital data. By analysing all collected data, i.e. training effort and vital parameters, actual health status of patients can be assessed and the recovery speed can be determined and compared to standard recovery speed for example.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par69">Strengthened evidence base on medical outcomes, economic benefits and effectiveness of the use of Personal Health Systems in evolved care models are the strengths of the StrokeBack approach. Physical therapists report that the vast majority of patients (up to 80 %) does not do the exercises shown to them when they are at home and that the number of patients doing the exercises correctly is even lower. Here, the StrokeBack system provides significant improvements. Its body-sensing features combined and integrated with EHR/PHR to enable therapists to easily monitor the effectiveness of exercises (number and correctness of executed training sessions) in recovering from traumas caused by strokes by correlating the types of exercises prescribed and their execution with changes in psychokinetic performance and body coordination.</Para>
          <Section2 ID="Sec14">
            <Heading>Reinforced Medical Knowledge <Emphasis Type="Italic">Versus</Emphasis> Efficient Disease Management</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par70">StrokeBack-supported rehabilitation exercises are recorded in the EHR and/or PHR databases similarly to other therapies and medicines. Therapists and patients’ physicians are able to record various performance parameters and patients improvement ratings in the EHR/PHR. As a result they are able to reliably (considering that a large number of cases are cross-checked statistically) arrive at establishing medically acceptable procedures for applying certain types of therapies to certain types of exhibited stroke-induced mental and motor-coordination disabilities.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par71">The proposed StrokeBack approach contributes to a more sustainable European healthcare system through provision of high quality, personalised care, with better use of the available healthcare resources. StrokeBack helps to improve knowledge on the impact of rehabilitation effort as sketched above. By that it allows better planning on how available resources could/should be used. This could be for example additional support for patients who really put effort in their rehabilitation in order to improve their health status as fast as possible to a level in which they do no longer need help. Another option could be to reduce effort for those patients who recover due to the StrokeBack system very well and put freed resources to support patients who are recovering more slowly. A general decision how freed resource should be used is out of the scope of this proposal and it might be needed to decide individually. In addition, it is well known that patients feel better at home, so reducing the time in hospital improves quality of life for patients. StrokeBack contributes to this as well. In addition, it allows physical therapists and medical doctors to evaluate the impact of training sequences on the patients’ recovery process. By that these specialists are empowered to personalise training sequences to helping individual patients.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par72">Reinforced leadership and innovation capability of the industry in the area of Personal Health Systems, medical devices and services through introduction of new business models, creation of spin-offs and better exploitation of intellectual property contributing to products, standards and regulation.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par73">To the best of our knowledge, StrokeBack is the first system that aims at remote rehabilitation of stroke patients which does not require a physical therapist to monitor the execution of training sequences. Even more it is the first system that clearly addresses patients in early recovery stages, i.e. long before they are able to stand and hold remote controls in their hands, which is the point at which many already cited initiatives start. By that we see a solid chance to develop an unprecedented technology which can be used to gain international leadership in this market segment, and which can be commercialised by the project partners directly or by a common spin off company. Two of the partners (IHP; MEYTEC) have already started discussions to assess the potential of a joint venture in the telemedical area. Here, StrokeBack could be a concrete starting point. Accelerated establishment of interoperability standards and of secure, seamless communication of health data between all involved partners, including patients is ensured.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par74">The StrokeBack project aims at designing and testing a PHS which allows interaction between medical doctors, physical therapists and patients. The issue of proper security features as well as proper privacy protection are addressed in the StrokeBack system. Relevant standards have been taken into account in order to allow for compatibility from the very beginning. In addition, the StrokeBack architectural design follows a modular approach so that specific module, e.g. cryptographic operations can be exchanged transparently. Moreover, relying on web services for remote operations decouples the services almost fully from the underlying technologies. Also, one of the StrokeBack partners involved in a national project, called MATRIX [<CitationRef CitationID="CR113">113</CitationRef>], which researches telemedical systems in compliance to the HL7/VITAL (ISO/IEEE 11073) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR114">114</CitationRef>] standard while aiming to contribute to new standardisation processes as well. We exploited this cooperation for securing interoperability. Links and interaction between patients and doctors facilitates a more active participation of patients in care processes.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par75">StrokeBack allows to record patients vital data 24 h 7 days a week as well as to record his/her training effort and success. By that doctors and physical therapists can adapt the treatment exactly to the patient needs and can respond to variations in the recovery processes. Since all parties can have access to the data via networks, the need for physical meetings is reduced and thus faster and more often feedback between the parties is feasible. One of the major benefits of StrokeBack is the direct patient feedback. This can be used twofold. First, patients get direct feedback concerning training exercises they carry out, i.e. the patients see whether or not they do the training correctly and by that can improve the training execution. Second, patients can get personalised feedback on how fast they recover from the data recorded when exercising. This feature can be enriched with the vital parameters which are recorded as well. By this personalised long-term feedback to patients significantly increased patient motivation leading to additional training effort and by far better understanding of the recovery process by patients.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par76">Participation of essential stakeholders in the production of end-to-end solutions for personalised care has been of paramount importance when developing the StrokeBack solution. Partners participating in the project reinforced national or regional commitment in deployment of innovative services following participation in R&amp;D projects. Two partners of the StrokeBack consortium have strong expertise in the realisation of end-to-end solutions in the telemedical area. The partner MEYTEC has several years of expertise in building telemedical systems for treatment of acute stroke patients, and their systems are deployed in hospital and managed by MEYTEC since several years. MEYTEC also hosts WEB service-based medical services. ICOM expertise lies in the development of leading edge telecommunication products and solutions, delivering end-to-end integrated solutions, implementing large-scale turnkey projects, providing a wide range of engineering, consulting and outsourcing professional services in thematic areas of mobile, wired and wireless communication, e-Health and Tele-Assistance solutions, Smart Energy and Audio-Visual systems. Dedication to R&amp;D and commitment to technology innovation are fundamental components of the company’s business strategy with a long record in research in networked systems and active product lines, actively participating in shaping up the future.</Para>

            <Heading>European Contribution</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par77">The StrokeBack has pursued ambitious objectives, offering complementary technological expertise from various fields. The StrokeBack consortium covered all the required expertise ranging from the medical and physical therapy requirements over efficient wireless communication and signal processing to secure and dependable network and service architecture including personal health services and the management of remote health services. In order to ensure significant impact of the technology developed in the StrokeBack project, it has developed an open architecture, taking into account existing standards and ensuring interoperability and easy adaptability by design. A consortium reflecting all parts of the value chain stimulated better user acceptance of the system and reflected a diversity of the European community. In other words, the consortium needs to be a European one to get the support of relevant Europe-wide stakeholders and not only from national stakeholders. In addition, the required expertise is hardly found in a single country.</Para>

IHP is participating in that project and ensures close collaboration wherever possible and necessary. Since the major focus of MATRIX was on service composition, the overlap was very limited, nevertheless the collaboration helped to widen the impact of StrokeBack, since renowned medical sites, i.e. the Charité, were also partners in MATRIX, similarly to StrokeBack partner MEYTEC.
