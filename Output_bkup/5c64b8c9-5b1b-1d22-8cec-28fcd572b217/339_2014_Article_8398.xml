              <Para>X-ray grating interferometers produce three distinct signals; an absorption signal, a differential phase signal and a dark field signal. Until now a method for successfully creating dark field tomograms of nonisotropic samples has not been demonstrated. In this paper we test a method for creating such tomograms on a highly nonisotropic sample, i.e. a five layer “sandwich” of oriented carbon fibers. The fibers are parallel within the individual sandwich layers, but perpendicular to the fibers in the adjacent layers. We show that by choosing a rotation axis parallel to the grating stepping direction (i.e. a horizontal rotation axis in most setup configurations) it is possible to produce a darkfield tomogram where fibers parallel to the probed scattering direction appear to have no dark field signal. The method produces a tomogram in the form of a scalar field of dark field scattering values.</Para>

              <Para>Fiber reinforced materials have many applications in today’s society. In products where stiffness and low weight are crucial (e.g. wind turbine blades, high end bicycle frames and car chassis) glass- or carbon-fibers reinforced materials are often applied. To maximize strength and stiffness the fiber orientation of the fibers is crucial. Misaligned fibers have a devastating impact on the compressive strength of such materials, and the detection of misaligned fibers is therefore of great interest [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Visual inspection by microscopy gives only the fiber orientation distribution at the surface [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>] and not the fiber orientation distribution in the interior. 3D techniques based on X-ray absorption microtomography have been developed [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>] allowing for determination of interior fiber orientations. However, as typical sizes of glass- and carbon-fibers are in the range of 5–20 μm, and every fiber needs to be resolved with such techniques, it quickly becomes impractical for sample sizes exceeding a few millimeters. Grating interferometry based X-ray tomography uses the microstructure of the material as a contrast mechanism for dark field imaging. The method is sensitive to small structures (e.g. carbon fibers a few micrometers wide) decreasing the coherence of the X-ray beam, but images the resulting coherence signal with a pixel size much larger than the microstructure (e.g. a hundred micrometers or more), thus allowing us to map average scattering in samples much larger than what would have been possible if every component (e.g. individual carbon fibers) of the microstructure had to be within the resolution range of our detector. With this technique it has been demonstrated that the overall orientational characteristics in materials can be visualized but so far only in two-dimensional projections [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. Here we propose a new setup of the grating interferometry method that utilizes the insensitivity of the grating interferometry setup for fibers oriented along the grating direction. This is achieved by a simple tilt of the sample rotation axis 90° relative to the traditional setup geometry. With this new setup aligned fibers become almost invisible to the grating interferometer dark field signal, whilst non-aligned fibers clearly stand out, thereby allowing 3D tomographic reconstructions of the spatial distribution of fibers misoriented with respect to the main axis given by the grating.</Para>

                <Para>In the X-ray grating interferometer a partially coherent X-ray beam produces a Talbot interference pattern by passing through an X-ray phase grating [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. The interference pattern amplitude relative to the total beam intensity is called the visibility, and will depend on the coherence of the beam. The sample will introduce distortions in the interference pattern. The total intensity in the interference pattern will be lowered due to absorption, the fringes will be distorted due to refraction in the sample and the fringe visibility in the pattern will be lowered due to small angle scattering from the sample [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. Hence, imaging the lowering of the visibility is a measure of the small angle scattering strength and hence the technique is called X-ray dark field imaging [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>], which we will focus on the remaining part of the paper.</Para>
                <Para>Briefly, the experimental setup consisted of six main components in a laboratory-based X-ray grating interferometer as shown in the top part of Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>. The source was a rotating Cu anode with an effective spot size of 1 × 1 mm. The source grating was an Au slit grating introduced to minimize the effective source size of the X-rays. The period of the source grating was 14.1 μm. The phase grating was a Si grating introducing a π phase shift in half the beam, and thus producing a Talbot interference pattern. The period of this grating was 3.5 μm. The sample was mounted on a rotation stage between the phase grating and the absorption grating. The absorption grating was a Au absorption grating with a period of 2.0 μm matched to the period of the phase grating, while taking magnification of the beam into account. The detector was a Pilatus two-dimensional detector with a pixel size of 172 μm. The distance from the source grating to the phase grating was 140 cm, and the distance from the phase grating to the absorption grating was 20 cm. The center of the rotation stage was placed 10 cm from both phase and absorption grating.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

It is seen that the fibers of layers 2 and 4 remain parallel to the probed scattering direction in the horizontal rotation axis setup and hence invisible in the dark field image</SimplePara>

                <Para>The absorption grating in front of the detector is stepped along the grating direction in order to detect changes in the interference pattern. Changes in the visibility can only be observed along this direction and not perpendicular to it. Hence the sensitivity is highly directional and well suited to detect, i.e. the orientation of fibers [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. In the standard setup the sample rotation axis is perpendicular to the grating stepping direction, see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>, left image. We proposed a modified setup for tomographic mapping of misoriented fibers, see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>, right image. Since the grating stepping direction is the direction along which the incoherent scattering is probed in a dark field image, this setup kept the probed scattering direction constant within the sample, as the sample is rotated, which is not the case in a traditional vertical rotation axis setup. Beam decoherence occurs in the direction perpendicular to the fibers. Hence, in order to make a main direction of fibers invisible in dark field imaging, the fibers must be oriented along the grating direction and keep this direction during sample orientation. Hence, the rotation axis must be rotated 90° as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>, right.</Para>
                <Para>Although the probed scattering direction remains constant under sample rotation, the beam propagation direction through the sample does not. The aligned fibers in layers 2 and 4 are kept parallel with respect to the rotation axis and hence remain invisible. But the fibers in layers 1, 3 and 5 are not parallel with the rotation axis. This means that the magnitude of the scattering produced by these layers may fluctuate as the sample is rotated. This may violate the basic assumption in the reconstruction algorithm used to produce the tomogram. But if the fluctuations are sufficiently small compared to the difference between the signal from the aligned and misaligned fibers, this may not compromise the validity of reconstruction of the tomogram.</Para>
                <Para>As a reference, a scan with a traditional vertical rotation axis setup, was also performed. The setup and the geometry used for the two scans were exactly the same, except for the changed rotation axis.</Para>
                <Para>In the setup with a horizontal rotation axis, the fiber orientations in layers 2 and 4 were parallel to the grating stepping direction regardless of the rotation angle of the sample (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>, right). This meant that the magnitude of the scattering was always probed along the fibers’ longitudinal direction. In layers 1, 3 and 5 the fibers were perpendicular to the probed incoherent scattering direction, meaning that the incoherent scattering was always probed perpendicular to the fibers’ longitudinal direction (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>), which is the direction that produces small angle (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>) scattering.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig2">

              <Para>The scalar field this method produces can easily be extended to give a tensor field of the incoherent scattering in various directions for each volume element. This would only be a matter of rotating the sample along another axis than the sample stage rotation axis (in order to probe scattering in another direction), and then perform the tomogram measurement for the new scattering direction. This would enable us to probe incoherent scattering in several directions, and in this way investigate more complicated samples than the current, or alternatively for the sample used in this experiment, we could map not only the location of the misoriented fibers, but also their orientation.</Para>
