              <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par2">Limiting the man-made contribution to climate change by considerably reducing greenhouse gas emissions is regarded as one of mankind’s biggest challenges (Stern <CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2006</CitationRef>; Meinshausen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">2009</CitationRef>; IPCC <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2014</CitationRef>). The entire energy system needs restructuring and incremental technological change is insufficient to limit the global temperature rise (Antal and Hukkinen <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2010</CitationRef>). These scientific calls for ‘radical reform’ have been echoed by ambitious policy targets. For instance, the European Union (EU) provides a set of interdependent goals seeking to cut gas emissions by 40 % by 2030 and produce 27 % of its energy from renewable sources compared with 1990 levels. These targets are more ambitious than their predecessors of Europe 2020, although previous targets were binding. The 2020 targets, <Emphasis Type="Italic">inter alia,</Emphasis> considered a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % and a share of renewable energy of total energy consumption of 20 % by 2020.<Footnote ID="Fn1">
                  <Para ID="Par3">The European Commission (2011) provides additional targets for the contribution of renewable energy (RE) to the European electricity mix: 37 % by 2020. The fraction of electricity in total energy is on average 21$ in the EU. The contributions in the hereafter compared countries amounted to 20.1 % in Germany, 18.4 % in Denmark 23.9 in Spain in 2010 (IEA data).</Para>
                </Footnote> The transition to a new technology base will not be as smooth as previous transitions. The shift from wood to coal and subsequently to gas and oil occurred in a quasi-frictionless manner (Moriarty and Honnery <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">2012</CitationRef>). Over and above capital obsolescence and financial costs that the transition brings about (De Castro and Dutra <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2011</CitationRef>; Monopolkommission <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">2013</CitationRef>), there are imbalances between (sometimes) conflicting policy objectives that hamper the change to a new capital stock. In particular, this concerns sector regulation that seeks to maintain security of supply and promotion of volatile renewable energy.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par4">Volatile renewable energy is defined as renewable energy that is not stored prior to electricity generation. This includes not only wind and solar PV energy technologies but also technologies like tidal power and run-of-river hydropower (Cochran et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2012</CitationRef>). These facilities replace peak and emergency capacities due to their lower marginal costs on the wholesale market. Especially the deployment of cost-competitive wind power increasingly influences market outcomes and infrastructure requirements (Klessmann et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par5">This challenges the sector framework which is set by the policy objectives of the European Commission—sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply (European Commission <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">2006</CitationRef>). These are typically pursued to an equal extent by uncoordinated policy fields with separate stakeholders and policy makers. Hence, stakeholders often have conflicting interests and also different negotiation powers (del Río González <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2008</CitationRef>). Especially in Germany, there is evidence that outage risks increase (Bundesnetzagentur <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2011</CitationRef>; Schleicher-Tappeser and Piria <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2012</CitationRef>). This reflects that policy making has not fully adapted to the new setting that the diffusion of renewable energy (RE) technologies brings about, which has been particularly rapid in recent times (Wilson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR40">2013</CitationRef>). It is unclear how institutions and policies can be designed to provide an equilibrium between conflicting policy objectives (del Río González <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par6">The guiding question of this paper is as following: why did some countries increasingly face outage risks while others remained largely devoid of such difficulties? We argue that there are inherent trade-offs in energy policy objectives that pose frictions to the establishment of a new technology base. Three policy fields will be analysed: (1) the development of generation capacities, (2) promotion policies for RE and (3) the electricity transmission grids. These jointly determine the systemic performance, i.e. the integration of RE in the electricity mix under the condition of maintaining the security of supply (del Río González <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2008</CitationRef>; Rykkja et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR36">2014</CitationRef>). The results indicate that enhanced policy coordination mechanisms may mitigate outage risks.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par7">In addition to its policy relevance, this study contributes to the literature in several ways. It provides rare cross-country evidence of the outcomes of different public policies and institutional architectures in the electricity sector. The case study approach allows studying a phenomenon where large samples are lacking (Rykkja et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR36">2014</CitationRef>). In addition, the analysis goes beyond a single-country analysis but uses experiences from three countries by providing an analysis of the attributes of policy fields, thereby adding a multilevel dimension (Foxon et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par8">The remainder of this article is divided as follows: first, some conceptual thoughts and the method are presented. Then, the stage is set by a sketch of the underlying difficulty to maintain security of supply which is also linked to trade-offs in policy objectives; third, the selection of the comparison countries is justified and fourth, the country-specific policies in the abovementioned fields are presented. The paper closes with a discussion of the results and concluding remarks.</Para>

The guiding question can be addressed by various theoretical concepts. This study approaches the interplay of the analysed policy fields from a systems theory perspective. In addition, it draws on economic efficiency concepts that mirror difficulties to maintain security of supply by trade-offs and inconsistent policy objectives.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par10">The electricity sector changed substantially from a once largely planned system with few suppliers to one with many nodes and multiple suppliers where some consumers are also producers. This has challenged system predictability and stability (Hughes <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">1987</CitationRef>; Friesenbichler <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2013</CitationRef>). In order to discuss how the interplay of policy fields mutually shape systemic outcomes, one can interpret the electricity sector as an evolving system in which the interdependencies of the actions (policies) of relatively independent agents (policy makers) determine the overall performance of the system (Arthur et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">1997</CitationRef>; Arthur <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">1999</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para ID="Par11">Kaufman and Johnsen (<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">1991</CitationRef>) show theoretically that a relatively small increase in the number of actors (and the degree of systemic interdependencies) substantially increases possible systemic outcomes. This can be applied to the electricity sectors that underwent a large increase in agents with the arrival of RE. In the model, most outcomes are inconsistent. In this case, consistency is defined as an optimal outcome. In the present context, this would be an outcome where all policy objectives are achieved to the furthest possible extent.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par12">This evokes questions about the optimal policy design. A hypothetical ‘sectoral planner’ would design an optimal system with few interdependencies and little uncertainty to optimise outcomes (Hughes <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">1987</CitationRef>; Morçöl <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2012</CitationRef>) thereby minimising risks of outages. However, with decentralised production structures and fragmented policy making, more and more agents and interdependencies have emerged. It remains unclear how institutions can be designed to achieve optimal outcomes, especially against the background of conflicting policy objectives.</Para>

                <Heading>Research method</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par13">Methodologically, this study is a three-country case study about the interplay of the attributes of the abovementioned policy fields. The case study approach was chosen because data are not sufficiently available to implement statistical methods, and the analysed experiences may largely depend on country-specific environments. Several information sources have been used including key policy documents, secondary literature and publicly available data. Elements of the microeconomic market selection mechanism, technology policy literature, as well as the sector specific regulatory framework were used to identify cross-country differences. Considering the scope of this research, neither a granular policy discussion nor the underlying political economy will be analysed.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par14">The fragmentation of the European electricity market is used as the background to analyse cross-country variance in policy making. Germany serves as a showcase that eagerly promoted the diffusion of RE technologies in its electricity sector. This led to export from Germany to other countries and has increasingly caused difficulties with the grid stability, i.e. the lack of a steady balance between production and consumption, a prerequisite for a stable electricity grid and a secure supply of electricity. This paper explores why other countries remained largely devoid of similar difficulties. We compare policies and institutional arrangements in the abovementioned policy fields and then link the observed differences to differences in sectoral outcomes.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par15">The technological focus here is on wind and solar power. Some RE technologies have largely reached their saturation point. For instance, the market for hydropower is already highly developed, and hydropower development focuses on modernisation, upgrading and conversion of existing facilities (World Energy Council <CitationRef CitationID="CR42">2015</CitationRef>). Others have not yet been deployed on a large scale for a number of reasons. For instance, the World Energy Council (<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">2013</CitationRef>) analyses the diffusion marine power technologies. Despite sometimes considerable technological progress, costs remain high pending the implementation of larger scale projects (tidal power). Sometimes it is unclear what technology will prevail among competing concepts (wave energy), or if and how engineering challenges can be overcome (ocean thermal energy conversion). Biomass is a RE source which potentially provides constant supply. However, its generation costs are significantly higher than for wind; the results for solar power are mixed (Nakada et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">2014</CitationRef>). Hence biomass is not considered in this analysis. Moreover, technological advances may potentially solve the issues induced by volatile energy generation. For instance, recent projections predict biomass to become more and more price competitive (Nakada et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">2014</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Heading>Trade-offs inherent to policy objectives</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par16">The difficulties to maintain security of supply emerge from trade-offs in policy objectives that mirror economic efficiency concepts. European electricity policy principles reflect the politically desired outcomes of the electricity sector: sustainability, security of supply and competitiveness (European Commission <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">2006</CitationRef>). If this nationally implemented triangle of objectives is pursued to an equal extent, then an inherent trade-off may lead to an increase in outage risks. Due to their cost competitiveness, RE puts pressure on conventional energy sources. However, these typically serve as peak and emergency capacities. This trade-off is mirrored by economic efficiency concepts, namely dynamic (investment) and static (price) efficiency.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par17">Dynamic efficiency refers to investment incentives. In this context, dynamic efficiency is particularly relevant due to the integration of more RE in the grid and the provision of flexible capacities to cover peak loads and provide emergency capacities to avoid outages. At the same time, the market is required to induce static and allocative efficiency, i.e. guarantee electricity supply through a competitive selection mechanism at prices that reflect marginal costs. The trade-off is as follows: higher prices induce static inefficiencies, but they induce firms to invest (Gugler et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par18">Static efficiency on the wholesale electricity market is implemented by a selection mechanism, the merit order. This mechanism ranks technologies by their marginal costs and thereby provides a feed-in order. The most cost-competitive technologies obtain a feed-in priority. Wind and solar power are produced at negligible marginal costs and are therefore highly competitive on the wholesale market. As a result, the merit order effect prefers wind and solar power and lowers the demand for electricity from conventional sources such as nuclear power, coal, gas and oil plants. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef> shows stylised supply and demand functions in a merit order setting. Suppliers on the right side of the demand curve lay idle as RE on the left side displaces technologies with higher marginal costs.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

              <Para ID="Par19">The arrival of RE at low costs results in the exit of relatively ‘dirty’ technologies and the price reduction. Yet, the displacement effect challenges the design of the wholesale market. The demand curve is rather inelastic. RE technologies outperform conventional power producers. However, wind and solar supply are volatile, and outputs are relatively difficult to predict. Since electricity cannot be stored but only transformed into another source of energy, RE technologies need complementary facilities to balance supply and demand. This may occur via storage capacities such as pumped-storage hydroelectricity plants which pump water from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation. Low-cost off-peak electricity is then used to operate the pumps while, during periods of high demand, the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power. However, flexible capacities are often technologies displaced by the selection mechanism. Their provision is not a viable business model due to the displacement of the wholesale market. This is called the ‘missing money’ problem (Joskow <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">2008</CitationRef>). Hence, the growing contribution of RE relies on capacities that are not cost-competitive due to the merit order effect. In other words, wholesale prices for the base load decrease, but capacities for the peak load and emergency capacities are being displaced. This increases the likelihood of shortage situations (Philibert <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par20">Especially in Germany, a country considered to be at the forefront of climate-change policies, the deployment of wind and solar power was strongly promoted. This successfully altered the capital stock of the electricity sector, which—through the merit order effect—put pressure on the wholesale market to provide security of supply. The situation was aggravated by the shutdown of nuclear power plants (Bundesnetzagentur <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2011</CitationRef>; Fürsch et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2012</CitationRef>). There was excess electricity production in peak times that needed to be exported to stabilise the grid. Two critical situations emerged, which were eventually resolved by the emergency purchase of nationally provided cold reserves from a neighbouring country igniting a public debate on both grid stability and energy policies. Several remedies have been discussed which are reflected by the abovementioned policy field.<Footnote ID="Fn2">

              <Para ID="Par22">We compare experiences in Germany, Spain and Denmark. These countries were identified in a qualitative selection process. First, we focused on EU member states to analyse countries that have a similar legal framework. We sought to geographically cover the European electricity market. Since a single market does not yet exist, we used this fragmentation to identify variances in policies. We drew comparison countries from the main regional market blocks. Germany is in continental European, Denmark in the Nordic and Spain in the Iberian (Southwest) market. Second, we considered countries that financially promoted the diffusion of RE technologies effectively leading to an increase of RE in the electricity mix. EU member states that do not pursue the Europe 2020 targets were excluded. Cognisant of possible trade-offs between budgetary and social objectives and ecological targets (De Castro and Dutra <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2011</CitationRef>), some new member states and/or countries implementing austerity programmes increasingly rely on conventional, low-cost sources and continue to operate largely depreciated, conventional plants. Third, we identified countries that departed from a relatively high contribution of conventional power sources such as coal, gas or oil and then significantly increased the share of RE in the electricity mix (see Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef>).<Footnote ID="Fn3">
                  <Para ID="Par23">This selection also reflects technological capabilities of the economies. The European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS) depicts Denmark as an ‘innovation leader’. Germany is in the country group of ‘followers’, and Spain—a ‘moderate innovator’—ranks as the lowest.</Para>

                <Para ID="Par28">Discussions in Germany about changing the energy mix began as early as the 1980s. The awareness of the effects of climate change emerged amidst anti-nuclear protests, the aftermath of the oil crisis of the 1970s and the acid rain controversy. The general sentiment was moulded into effective policies initiating a ‘greening’ process within electricity production which then spread to the heating and transportation sector.</Para>

                  <Heading>Capacities</Heading>
                  <Para ID="Par29">The degree of competition on the German electricity market has been fierce after the sector’s liberalisation. Producers of conventional power lost market shares between 2007 and 2012, and wholesale peak prices fell by approximately 45 %. This decrease was absorbed by the profit margins of suppliers. Prices reached a level where coal and gas plants hardly covered fixed operational costs. Wind and solar power further intensified competition which was mirrored by wholesale price developments. The generated price-quantity curve is flat in the lower load range that is provided by wind, solar, hydro technologies and nuclear power, as well as brown and stone coal plants. Gas, coal and oil facilities occupy the upper load range (LBD <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para ID="Par30">Producers in the upper load range capacities were particularly affected by the change in the electricity mix. Especially peak and emergency capacities that cover the difference between the daily base load of approximately 45 GW and the peak demand of approximately 70 GW are under pressure. They lost approximately 70 % of their operating hours between 2007 and 2010. At the end of 2012, approximately 15–18 GW were not profitable due to their high marginal costs and are therefore likely to exit. In addition, Germany’s energy turnaround (‘Energiewende’) plays a key role. The shutdown of nuclear power plants has reduced the degree of competition in the lower load range, while it has also reduced the amount of steadily available electricity. Moreover, the deployment of wind and solar capacities is likely to further intensify competition in the coming years, especially in the upper load range (LBD <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para ID="Par31">The generation system has expanded in 2014. Additional coal capacities of approximately 8 GW were made operational, mainly to supply to Southern Germany. These plants have improved the provision of the base load but added to the economic pressure on existing peak capacity plants. Market forecasts predict that capacities between 26 and 31 GW will not be economically feasible by 2022. All currently operational peak capacities are affected (LBD <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2012</CitationRef>). This issue has been recognised by the German Monopolies Commission, an advisor to the German government and legislature in the areas of competition policy making, competition law and regulation. In 2013, it stated that is yet undecided what mechanism will be implemented to cover peak capacities (Monopolkommission <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>

                  <Para ID="Par32">RE technology promotion started in 1990 when the electricity feed-in act obliged grid operators to grant access to producers of distributed RE. Two additional goals were included by the ‘Renewable Energy Act’ in 2000: the exit of nuclear power and a share of RE in total energy consumption of 12.5 % by 2010. The share of nuclear power decreased substantially from 28.6 % in 2000 to 17.8 % in 2011. RE accounted for 11.4 % in total energy consumption in 2010.</Para>
                  <Para ID="Par33">Pegged feed-in tariffs and soft loans facilitated the increase in RE. The pegged tariffs were adjusted several times. For example, the RE-act of 2000 uncoupled the feed-in tariffs from the electricity retail price and set prices according to effective generation costs. A differentiated pricing between and within generation technologies was introduced depending on plant type, size and external factors (e.g. wind speed, sun hours, fuel type for biomass). A tariff digression was also considered. The tariffs are fixed for 20 years. In 2004, the volumes of pecuniary promotions were adjusted to the benefit of photovoltaic, biomass and geothermal power while feed-in tariffs for wind power were reduced (Haas et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>

                  <Heading>The transmission grid</Heading>
                  <Para ID="Par34">The transmission grid is subject to a fierce public debate. The market for transmission systems is split geographically among four private companies: TenneT TSO GmbH, Amprion, TransnetBW GmbH, Amprion GmbH and 50 Hz Transmission GmbH. The grids are jointly regulated by the Federal Network Agency, Bundesnetzagentur (Klessmann et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para ID="Par35">This split raises the question about the market design. It is unclear what form the optimal price zone should take. The present structure has not been economically or technically justified, and alternatives have never been assessed. Alternatives include a single German pricing zone, several price zones or nodal prices. Over and above the price zone, a different grid structure might provide more stability. An expansion of the infrastructure is discussed as a possible remedy that precludes congestions. There are plans to establish four parallel north–south high-voltage DC lines which would connect Northern German wind power turbines with large consumers in the South (Schleicher-Tappeser and Piria <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para ID="Par36">German policy makers in the electricity transmission arena continue to promote RE. All RE suppliers that sell their electricity under the feed-in tariff scheme are exempted from balancing responsibility. They neither have to deliver generation schedules nor carry balancing costs. The transmission system operators (TSOs) are in charge of forecasting and balancing loads (Klessmann et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2008</CitationRef>). Germany’s grid management has made considerable progress in integrating variable generation. In 2013, pumped-storage facilities were established with capacities amounting to approximately 7 GW. Germany also decoupled combined heat and power plants and provided more flexible conventional generators to virtual power plants which increased the system’s flexibility. Yet, the merit order effect ensures that the greatest amount of variable RE possible is brought to market. This makes more costly flexible capacities more important (Cochran et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2012</CitationRef>; Fürsch et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2012</CitationRef>; LBD <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2012</CitationRef>). The wholesale market allows for negative pricing, i.e. operators pay for the load they feed into the grid at times of very low demand. Recently, the legal framework incorporated incentives to large electricity producers to sell directly on the wholesale market (Cochran et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Spain</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par37">Spain’s energy diversification departed from a 40 % share of coal in electricity production in 1990. Greening of electricity production aimed at increasing domestic employment in the sector and at reducing the dependency on external price developments. The latter was only partly successful. While the share of coal fell to 15 % by 2011, there was a shift towards imported gas whose contribution to electricity generation rose from only 1 % in 1990 to 29 % in 2011.</Para>

                  <Heading>Capacities</Heading>
                  <Para ID="Par38">The displacement of peak and emergency capacities occurred in Spain, but to a lesser degree than in Germany. An indicator for this phenomenon is the use of emergency capacities which are mainly combined cycle gas turbines in Spain. The deployment of RE caused the load factors of gas-fired generation to fall below a capacity utilisation of 40 % by 2009. The decline was intensified by a decrease in demand for Eléctrica l power due to the economic crisis (Federico <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2010</CitationRef>). The utilisation level of emergency capacities still remains substantially higher than in Germany, where in 2011 emergency capacities were on average 170 h operational. Their financial break-even utilisation is approximately 1000 h (LBD <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2012</CitationRef>). Spain’s risk exposure due to the shutdown of emergency capacities is therefore smaller than in Germany.</Para>

                  <Heading>Technology promotion</Heading>
                  <Para ID="Par39">The main promotion instrument has been the feed-in tariff (an extra fee paid to RE-generated electricity) which has been in place since 1994. Depending on the technology, the feed-in tariff was initially higher to increase the cash flows in the initial years of operation and reduced after 15, 20, or 25 years of operations. In 1998, an option was given to producers of green electricity to choose between a fixed tariff and a premium tariff. Operators can switch between these two promotions every 12 months. The premium was paid on top of the electricity market price. The premium option has been modified in 2004 and 2007 to cope with rising imbalances between increased RE and security of supply. Before 2007, the premium was independent from the market price. Due to wholesale price increases between 2004 and 2006, the reform in 2007 introduced an upper and lower pricing bound allowing policy makers to control the profit margins of operators and thereby investment incentives. The premium option remained the preferred promotion instrument which was used by 97 % of the wind part operators in 2007. Since the price premium rests on market prices, there is no transformation of the load profile necessary as would be with regulated feed-in tariffs (del Río González <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2008</CitationRef>; Klessmann et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2008</CitationRef>; Haas et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para ID="Par40">The promotion has been highly successful especially in facilitating the deployment of wind RE technologies (Klessmann et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2008</CitationRef>). Even though the reforms rendered the promotion system more complex, it remained rather transparent (del Río and Gual <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2007</CitationRef>). Also soft loans to finance investments in RE were available until 2006. Tax incentives and regional investment promotions were made available, and RE technologies have been granted preferential grid access (del Río González <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2008</CitationRef>; Haas et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2011</CitationRef>). In Spain, changes in the support scheme in 2008 led to a deployment halt of solar power. The financial crisis led to a moratorium of promotions in 2012 which discontinued the diffusion of RE technologies altogether.</Para>

                  <Heading>The transmission grid</Heading>
                  <Para ID="Par41">Spanish policies integrated a substantial share of onshore wind in its electricity mix, even though the rapid deployment of wind power challenged grid stability. In 2012, approximately half of the electricity demand could be met by wind energy over the course of several hours. The integration of such a large amount of volatile capacities is insofar remarkable that the grid of the Iberian power market is mostly isolated. International compensation for excess supply or demand is hardly possible (del Río González <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para ID="Par42">The institutional architecture in Spain was the first worldwide to set up an agency that controls and supervises its renewable energy generation, mainly wind farms. In addition, it is in charge of the integration of its production into the electricity system in a way that is compatible with grid stability (Red Eléctrica <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">2008</CitationRef>). RE enjoys priority grid access, and Spain has taken measures to adapt to the new energy mix. To overcome challenges to grid stability, Spain’s single transmission system operator, Red Eléctrica de Espana, established the Control Centre for Renewable Energies (CECRE) serving as the pivotal institution that managing the grid and balances the policy objectives. The grid is controlled by Red Eléctrica, while CECRE is in charge of grid stability. It monitors information and determines whether generation scenarios are acceptable for facilities with a generation capacity of at least 10 MW. Owners of RE installations are obliged to provide real-time telemetry. Even though there is guaranteed grid access (Klessmann et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2008</CitationRef>), Red Eléctrica has an objection right by not issuing connection permits to the high-voltage network. It is permitted to reject grid access if the system’s security of supply is seen at risk. Large wind farms and solar installations must provide reactive power support (del Río González <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2008</CitationRef>; Cochran et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2012</CitationRef>; Red Eléctrica <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para ID="Par43">Moreover, the CECRE in Spain regulates the feed-in load. RE suppliers are responsible for balancing power which, however, depends on the remuneration option. Under the feed-in tariff, operators are partly responsible for balancing the load. They are obliged to announce the generated daily load 30 h before the start of the day. Non-compliance results in penalties if the target load (considering a pre-defined range) is not met, and bonus payments are offered for maintaining the range. Under the premium option, RE generators—like any other market participant—are fully responsible for delivering their daily schedule. Contracts with intermediaries are typically in place, using the Spanish intra-day electricity market (del Río González <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2008</CitationRef>; Klessmann et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Para ID="Par44">Denmark sought to diversify its energy mix to reduce exposure to external supply shocks, especially after the oil crisis in 1973. Initial governmental plans to establish nuclear power plants to reduce risk exposure were heavily opposed by civil society leading the government to abandon its atomic energy policy in favour of support of RE. Wind turbines were suitable for the country’s decentralised settlement structure and its natural factor endowments, strong and steady winds.</Para>

                  <Para ID="Par45">The Danish electricity sector’s emergency capacities are negligible despite large contributions of wind power. Imbalances are managed by international electricity trade on the wholesale market. Denmark is a small market that is tightly connected with its neighbours in the Nordic power market and with Germany to its South. Its transfer capacity amounts to approximately 80 % of the country’s peak demand (Cochran et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2012</CitationRef>). Excess electricity is exported. West Denmark exported on average 57 % of its wind power, and East Denmark an average of 45 % between 2004 and 2007. Most shortages are absorbed by stable hydroelectric electricity predominantly from Norway and Sweden. Also, the system is optimised by real-time price signals on the wholesale spot market supporting trading partners adjusting their generation (CEPOS <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>

                  <Para ID="Par46">The Danish promotion strategy relies on pegged feed-in tariffs whose levels have been continuously adjusted. Budgetary restrictions and concerns about the cost competitiveness of wind power led to a reduction in financial support in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. The deployment of wind turbines dropped, but the sector’s scale economies and site profitability increased. In the mid-2000s, the support volume was increased again spurring a new deployment wave of RE technologies (Meyer <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">2007</CitationRef>; Haas et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para ID="Par47">Not only the diffusion of wind turbines but also the technology itself were supported. The installed small-scale turbines underwent a series of incremental innovations that were also promoted. Wind atlases were publicly provided to best use the local potential (Olesen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR33">2002</CitationRef>; Karnøe et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">2008</CitationRef>; Maegaard <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2009</CitationRef>; Schreuer and Weismeier-Sammer <CitationRef CitationID="CR38">2010</CitationRef>). In addition, demand was strongly considered in policies. Retail prices became more price-elastic than in other countries (Olesen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR33">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>

                  <Para ID="Par48">Energinet, the country’s publicly owned transmission system operator, closely collaborates with the distributed power producers. The grid is regulated by the Danish Energy Regulatory Authority, Energitilsynet. The emergence of distributed generation has led to gradual expansion of the infrastructure which was facilitated by the country-specific ownership structures. Facilities are often consumer-owned which substantially contributed to public acceptance of distribution grid expansion (Olesen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR33">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para ID="Par49">Albeit the grid stability relies on the Nordic market, the Danish electricity regulators have produced several innovations in output forecasting techniques and system planning tools. There are two intra-day electricity markets that provide real-time price signals which permit negative prices. The objective is to incentivise producers to align their production to demand and vice versa. Such situations occur between 20 and 100 h per year (Cochran et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2012</CitationRef>). A substantial share of the distributed generation does not enter the grid. Net metering for photovoltaic facilities and retail credit schemes provided incentives to consume rather than feed power into the grid (Haas et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Para ID="Par50">The analysis showed that multiple policy fields jointly determine the sector’s outcome. The deployment of volatile electricity generation challenged all comparison countries to maintain security of supply. There is consensus that the policy objective ‘security of supply’ must be maintained, and its pursuit takes a pivotal role in the legal framework of all comparison countries. Hence, all countries made considerable strides to integrate volatile RE.<Footnote ID="Fn4">
                  <Para ID="Par51">The challenges to integrate volatile renewable energy could have been avoided by refraining from the deployment of volatile electricity generation per se. In other words, policy makers could have maintained established production structures typically resting on coal, gas and oil, and not deploying RE. However, all comparison countries chose to promote RE. Their motives were manifold across countries including escaping the dependency on natural resources and the exposure to external, geopolitical developments, the reliance on nuclear power, avoiding a possible loss of competitiveness in energy technologies and to minimise the negative effects of man-made contribution to climate change.</Para>
                </Footnote> Policy makers implemented sophisticated grid management tools that control the feed-in load, i.e. re-dispatch instruments. Agencies in charge base their decisions on demand and supply forecasts that rest on previously collected information. Self-consumption increased especially in small-scale distributed facilities. Regulators in all countries are entitled to halt the feed-in of electricity from specific producers as a last resort (disconnecting consumers is politically undesired). Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">2</InternalRef> summarises these findings. There are the implemented grid management and promotion instruments which are similar across countries. Also the grid integration responsibility tends to be transferred to the respective TSO (Klessmann et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2008</CitationRef>). However, differences are revealed in the country-specific institutional settings.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab2">

              <Para ID="Par52">Three cross-country differences become evident. First, country size matters. Denmark successfully integrated volatile RE by compensating imbalances via the Nordic wholesale market. This was made possible by its size and open economy. Germany and Spain were less flexible in securing supply via international capacities.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par53">Second, the design of the promotion instruments differed. In Spain, promotions not only influence investment incentives, but also the required operative behaviour of suppliers. The premium option required RE operators meet pre-defined targets which mandated the management of systemic risks via balancing loads to RE generators. The premium scheme reduced the complexity to which regulators were exposed facilitating the provision of grid stability.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par54">Third, the institutional architectures differ. Since multiple policy fields are relevant for the sector’s outcomes, there are also several options to mitigate outage risks. The differences in institutional architectures seem to have contributed reducing coordination problems and thereby led to different sectoral outcomes. While Spain implicitly imposed a policy hierarchy by a control agency, Germany’s policies are less coordinated which is reflected by the policy debate.</Para>

                <Heading>An implicit policy hierarchy in Spain</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par55">Spanish energy policies draw on an institutional architecture in which a control centre prioritises the security of supply over other policy targets. This seems to have enabled the integration of a large amount of RE into the rather isolated Iberian market. While RE enjoys priority grid access similar to Germany, a control centre is able to reject connecting the facility if the long-term grid stability is at risk. Hence, a regulatory agency not only balances demand and supply by re-dispatch measures, but it also has the right to intervene directly in the generation structure.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par56">The control centre implicitly affects the pursued policy hierarchy and thereby reduces the complexity that the multi-agent system generates. It coordinates electricity policies, which would otherwise emerge in an uncoordinated way (Hughes <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">1987</CitationRef>). This is a critical element of multidimensional policy making which requires target hierarchies to rule out politically undesired outcomes (Morçöl <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2012</CitationRef>) such as outages. In other words, the institutional setting in Spain relaxes one of the three objectives of the electricity policy triangle by the EU and thereby resolves its inconsistencies. This target hierarchy in Spain is provided by institutional architecture and the design of the promotion (Cochran et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Section2 ID="Sec22">
                <Heading>Complex policy coordination in Germany</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par57">Despite Germany’s substantial degree of policy coordination, its institutional fragmentation hinders the systemic orientation of policies (Kuhlmann and Edler <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2003</CitationRef>). Germany lacks a clear policy hierarchy, which is mirrored by an unstructured public debate about energy policies relaxing either the sustainability objective by reducing the promotions for RE technologies or the competitive market principle (e.g. by reserve markets or grid planning). Hence, several remedies can be identified leading to insular energy policies that seek to secure grid stability. For instance, the German Monopolies Commission (Monopolkommission <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">2013</CitationRef>) concludes that the affected policy layers should be adjusted including the promotions of RE technologies, the design of the market for emergency capacities and the physical grid.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par58">One option to cope with inconsistencies between policy objectives is to adjust the promotions for renewables. The design of the promotions has been adjusted repeatedly in Germany which has hardly affected the deployment of wind and solar power. In Spain and Denmark, on the other hand, promotions were discontinued due to budgetary constraints which has affected the diffusion of renewable and also supported the stability of the grid (del Río and Gual <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2007</CitationRef>; del Río González <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2008</CitationRef>; Klessmann et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2008</CitationRef>; Haas et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2011</CitationRef>; Cochran et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2012</CitationRef>). However, the promotion halt in Denmark and Spain occurred due to financial restrictions and was not a reaction by policy makers to arising issues in a pursuit to balance inconsistent objectives.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par59">Another option to mitigate outage risks is the use of flexible, on-call reserves. Such a reserve or guaranteed capacity utilisation poses a planned outcome which by definition interferes with the market selection mechanism. For instance, the Federal Network Agency of Germany points out that the exit of steady nuclear power rendered the <Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis> − 1 principle of the security of supply unfeasible, i.e. the system cannot provide enough stability to compensate for one failing unit. This leads to regulatory interventions on the supply side, replacing the “…competitively structured market result by a more or less centrally planned approach. From an energy policy perspective, this is questionable, economically inefficient, and ecologically harmful, yet tolerable and necessary for a transition period”. (cit. Bundesnetzagentur <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2011</CitationRef>, own translation). The direct intervention in electricity generation by subsidising conventional capacities would not only undermine the competitive market but also partly reverse the politically desired exit of conventional technologies and thereby the sustainability objective. The phase-in promotion of RE would be combined with the promotion of undesired technologies which policy makers originally sought to phase-out.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par60">A further option is the adjustment of the German transmission grid which would contribute to resolving imbalances in consumption and generation. However, it has been argued that infrastructure requires considerable investments, and sunk costs may render the system inflexible thereby increasing its vulnerability. Long distance power lines might “solidify the structure of a centrally organised power supply from large units for decades” (cit. Schleicher-Tappeser and Piria <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2012</CitationRef>). Also, the planned grid may asymmetrically affect conventional technologies, because they allow carbon intensive coal plants to increase their capacity utilisation. A weaker grid would favour flexible gas plants that are located close to the bottlenecks. Moreover, the infrastructure also interacts with the sustainability objective (Schleicher-Tappeser and Piria <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para ID="Par61">Finally, it has been argued that if regulators accepted missing a few hours of wind peaks each year, only minor grid adjustment would be necessary (Schleicher-Tappeser and Piria <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2012</CitationRef>). However, this would contradict the legally guaranteed priority access of RE, a cornerstone of German RE policies. This discussion mirrors a more general debate that concerns the electricity sector. It is unclear how centrally and nationally planned infrastructures, the increasingly internationally interwoven markets and emerging distributed generation will interplay. Any hypothetical grid structure changes with the policy objectives that are pursued (e.g. a widely available infrastructure and secure supply are as desirable as low prices).</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusions and limitations</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par62">This paper presented a case study using cross-country variance in energy policies to explore issues with the grid stability due to the displacement of peak and emergency capacities by wind and solar power. The results indicate that the institutional framework should more explicitly consider a policy hierarchy. This may occur via a more efficient allocation of systemic risk, but also via the regulatory architecture implicitly imposing policy hierarchies. Both indicate the relevance of policy coordination.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par63">This finding has policy implications for the design of the electricity sector’s regulatory architecture at the country level. In addition, it also affects policies at the European Union level. A hierarchy of objectives contradicts the idea that all policies can be achieved to an equal extent which is what policy documents tend to assume. The European Union seems to pursue a ‘systemic industrial and innovation policy’, a mix of policy coordination, regulation and promotion thought to suffice to achieve societal and ecological goals (Aiginger <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par64">Certainly, there are limitations to this study. It is important to note that although the mechanisms proposed are conceptually plausible and supported empirically, we only observe the attributes of policy fields in three comparison countries that differ in their size and geography. To shed further light on the underlying mechanisms, future studies may seek to explore the functioning of the institutional setting in greater detail and include more countries in the analysis. Cognisant of these issues, we nevertheless believe that this paper makes several interesting contributions and may help to focus future research work.</Para>
