          <Heading>Abstract</Heading>
          <Para ID="Par1">This chapter reflects the objectives and the design of the StrokeBack Body Area Network (BAN) with respect to the requirements given by the application scenarios of clinical assessment and recognition of daily activities, as well as the user feedback from patients and therapists. The StrokeBack sensor platform, called GHOST, is designed to provide smaller size, more efficient power consumption, stronger security means and much better usability than the currently available state-of-the-art sensing devices. The GHOST platform is a tiny sensor platform with inertial sensors, Qi compliant wireless power transfer and an embedded Bluetooth Low-Energy (Bluetooth 4.0) front end. In a full package, the complete GHOST sensor platform is of matchbox size only, including a Lithium cell battery pack and a receiver coil for wireless power transfer. Two versions of the StrokeBack sensor nodes have been assembled. The first sensor node design uses the shelf components while the second variant of the sensor nodes incorporates a customised crypto-microcontroller providing enhanced security options. This platform is used for detection of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) within the StrokeBack project, where the patient wears the platform at the affected limb. The daily data flow principle is described in detail. The platform collects movement data from accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer throughout the day, which are uploaded and analysed during the night when the sensor resides in the wireless charging station.</Para>

      <Body>
        <Section1 ID="Sec1">
          <Heading>Motivation and Objectives for the Use of Body-Worn Sensors</Heading>
          <Para ID="Par2">The StrokeBack project pursues providing two novel training and assessment means for patients in the post-stroke rehabilitation at home. The first approach develops a fixed training place that allows supervised rehabilitation training at home. It is a fully equipped workstation with sensors, cameras and other components necessary to support autonomous training sessions according to a pre-defined schedule.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par3">To complement the training system, the second approach facilitates the use of body-worn sensors, called Body Area Network (BAN), to monitor and assess the patient’s activities during daily life, especially during the time when the patient does not perform any other rehabilitation training. In other words, the data gathered by the BAN allows for delivering more detailed insights of what usually remains hidden for the therapist in the ambulant rehabilitation phase, i.e. how the rehabilitation training influences daily life of the patient.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par4">The BAN captures motion data of upper extremities during daily life of a patient. It is used to document transfer of motion abilities regained in training sessions. It logs sensor data and transmits it to a local base station in regular intervals, where these data are analysed before results are stored in the Personal Health Record (PHR). In this way, the therapists will be provided with objective data about patient activities for assessing individual rehabilitation progress and health status of the patient.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par5">This approach provides several advantages in contrast to other ones such as video monitoring. Sensor nodes are relatively cheap, minimal invasive only, not bound to certain area or fixed power supply and hence, they can be used nearly everywhere and at any time. In addition, sensors can be easily adapted to other or refined tasks, e.g. by reprogramming or new extension modules (yet including actuators) to overcome problems and needs that may occur during development or use. Last but not least, the number of nodes per patients and task can be adapted quite efficiently due to their autonomous and cooperative nature.</Para>
        </Section1>
        <Section1 ID="Sec2">
          <Heading>Goals of BAN Use</Heading>
          <Para ID="Par6">There are three main tasks the StrokeBack sensor nodes will be used for, which will be sketched in the following three paragraphs.</Para>
          <Section2 ID="Sec3">
            <Heading>Clinical Assessment</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par7">The clinical assessment will be done by letting a patient execute a streamlined version of the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). Sensor nodes attached to the affected side of the patient’s upper limbs will thereby objectively measure speed and movement accuracy of executed exercises. Regular WMFT sessions with same patients will enable to compare gathered data for single exercises directly to assess rehabilitation progress.</Para>
          </Section2>
          <Section2 ID="Sec4">
            <Heading>Investigated Activities of Daily Life</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par8">Besides the training exercises, daily activities are to be monitored by the BAN throughout the day. Therefore, all collected raw data will be evaluated each day to gather statistics about activities and activity pattern. It is quite obvious that it is almost unfeasible to find out about all kind of activities the patient does during the day by just analysing sensor data, in particular with a minimum set of sensor attached. In principle, the StrokeBack team will try to automatically detect the following subset of ADL:<OrderedList>

</Para>
            <Para ID="Par13">These actions of course consist of consecutive or parallel sequences of smaller movements the BAN needs to classify. Given this data the BAN should help to get insights into the following things during the absence of the therapist:</Para>
            <Para ID="Par14">
<Emphasis Type="Italic">Activity of the patient in general</Emphasis>: This includes any information about what the patient does during the day, regardless whether the information is more general, e.g. percentage of time where the patient was sitting around, or whether it is related to particular movements such as ‘Reach and grasp an object’.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par15">
<Emphasis Type="Italic">Walking</Emphasis>: The number of steps taken or the walking distances reached per day are a pretty good measure for clinicians and therapists to assess the patient’s state of rehabilitation. Therefore, we’ll investigate an individualised step counter that can estimate the walking activity. Due to the very individual walking pattern of stroke patients, that differs between patients and usually differs from walking pattern of healthy subjects, we see a need to research novel algorithms for that.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par16">
<Emphasis Type="Italic">Comparison between affected/unaffected body parts</Emphasis>: One of the most important outcome measures of rehabilitation is the comparison of the usage of affected body parts in contrast to the unaffected parts. In ideal case, the algorithms to be developed will allow for direct comparison what kind of movements has been carried out with which part of the body at which time.</Para>
          </Section2>
          <Section2 ID="Sec5">
            <Heading>Instrumented Objects</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par17">For training of fine-grained hand motor skills, the StrokeBack sensor node may be integrated into objects for Arm Ability Training (AAT). Therefore, integration of a sensor node into a cube was investigated. The node gathers and reports the orientation of the cube in real time while being used in therapy, e.g. which side of the cube is currently on top. Using cubes or similar objects for simple tasks is common in occupational therapy. Here, the goal is to implement evidence-based occupational therapy means for effective home use.</Para>
          </Section2>
        </Section1>
        <Section1 ID="Sec6">
          <Heading>Related Work</Heading>
          <Para ID="Par18">Monitoring movement and activity both inside and outside the laboratory has been the focus of considerable research over the last years. Body-worn sensors such as goniometers [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>], pressure tubes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>], gyroscopes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>] and accelerometers [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>] have been used in a range of activities and clinical conditions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>] and for control of Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) in walking and upper limb movement [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>] and in standing with spinal cord injured patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. However, body-worn sensors are often bulky, require associated instrumentation and accurate placement of the sensor elements. Nevertheless, such studies have already demonstrated the feasibility and potential benefits of long-term monitoring of movement [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>] and what is needed now is a shift in approach to make this feasible and usable in clinical practice and particularly in the home environment for rehabilitation.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par19">A potential approach has already been embraced by the textile industry. The so-called smart textiles have been developed to measure vital signs, such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) and have even been commercialised in, for example, the SenseWear™ [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>], Samsung GearFit™ [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>] and the FitnessSHIRT™ [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>]. Predictions clearly indicate that wearable systems will become part of routine clinical investigations [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>]. Movement and activity are, however, more challenging than vital signs and additional processing, storing, transmitting and using the data poses an even greater challenge. The SMART [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>] project has explored how technology can be used in the home to support rehabilitation following stroke. Devices have been developed that are attached to the wrist and upper arm using clothing resembling sportswear to give a measure of movements made by the patient in activities prescribed by the therapist. Data are recorded and displayed on a computer or TV screen. Joint angles have also been measured using conductive fibres integrated into fabric which change their resistance due to bending as the joint angle varies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>] and by covering the fabric with an electrically conductive elastomer with piezo-resistive properties so that when deformed acts as a strain sensor able to detect movement [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>]. Nevertheless, smart textiles have yet not made it for ambulant home use by single persons, in particular due to the fact that these are hard or unfeasible to be dressed by partly impaired people. Similar objections have been raised by our therapists from the very beginning of our work as mentioned.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par20">Meanwhile several motion sensing systems, the so-called Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), are freely available on the market. These usually combine gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers (inertial sensors) with low power processing and short-range communication features. IMUs have been proven functional for body motion capture [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>], gait analysis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>] as well as monitoring of rehabilitation exercises for arm [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>] and hand training [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>]. For our very first experiments with both healthy and stroke subjects [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>], we have used the Shimmer platform [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>] that already fulfils the requirements in terms of processing and storage capabilities. However, we have not been fully satisfied with link errors in the Bluetooth connectivity resulting in unreliable data transfers, available security means and the overall power consumption. We have also investigated the use of XSENS platform [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>], but with initial costs of more than ten thousand euro for the first full set of sensors it was in our view way too expensive for our needs. In summary, both platforms still do not fulfil our needs regarding ease of use (no plugs and cables) and to some extent have been even too bulky for smooth usage in daily life, e.g. our subjects under investigation have felt that the Shimmer devices are too large in size.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par21">The existing techniques for taking measurements on the human body are generally considered to be adequate for the purpose but are often bulky in nature and cumbersome to mount. That especially holds true when it comes to individual use by a single person, in particular for stroke patients suffering from physical impairments or palsy. Moreover, published motion sensing systems in the rehabilitation area require usage of several devices—sometimes up to ten or more sensors [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>]—in parallel. The abilities to use mentioned sensing devices in a home environment is therefore very limited. Last but not least, existing platforms merely come along with standard encryption features based on low-power Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as well as unreliable and power hungry standard Bluetooth links.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par22">Our work addresses these deficiencies by extending the state-of-the-art approaches with up-to-date Bluetooth Low-Energy communication, enhanced usability and extended security features. The latter issue is incorporated by embedded means for low-power privacy protection and data security built upon our crypto-microprocessor with hardware for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). In addition, we have investigated some more technical features such as wireless power transfer to enhance the user-friendliness and thereby increase the acceptance of such system when used in daily life.</Para>
        </Section1>
        <Section1 ID="Sec7">
          <Heading>Objectives of BAN</Heading>
          <Para ID="Par23">As the sensing platform is to be used in applications outside of well-controlled laboratory environments, i.e. the daily life of patients, the physicians and therapists have specified a couple of requirements that should be met by the platform. Despite clinical/therapeutical advances and opportunities, usability is by far the most crucial acceptance factor! That means a comfortable and easy way to use the sensor nodes is the key to success in the real world beyond any research trials. Thus, body-worn sensors should work nearly ‘invisible’ and must not hinder the patient in his/her daily life activities. The sensors should be small and lightweight and allow for monitoring the patient for several hours or the whole day, respectively. The latter is certainly a trade-off between power consumption and an appropriate battery supply, which grow in size and weight with the amount of energy that is needed. All mentioned features are obvious of course. Considering them altogether in the right way allows for creating a proper <Emphasis Type="Italic">sensor node</Emphasis> that:<UnorderedList Mark="Bullet">

                <Para ID="Par24">
<Emphasis Type="Italic">Provides acceleration and orientation sensor data</Emphasis> of the sensor node itself for measuring relative speed and direction of motion. Merging data of several nodes at different points of the body will allow for analysing relative motion activities of the person’s body part wearing the sensor node. That way, insights into the accuracy and speed of rehabilitation training sequences and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) will be investigated and assessed automatically.</Para>

That especially holds true if sensor nodes are used in medical/clinical context, in particular due to the fact that gathered data is transmitted wirelessly to the base station at night (in theory freely accessible), from where it is uploaded into the PHR. Therefore, the sensor nodes should make use of standard encryption/decryption means to protect from non-authorised access to data. It may further provide flexible authentication and digital signature capabilities to ensure proper access control and data integrity.</Para>

Sensor nodes further deliver gathered data to a central network sink, i.e. the base station. In the StrokeBack system, the patient’s home station takes the part of the base station.

            <Para ID="Par53">The BAN will store all data gathered throughout the day, i.e. when the patient wears it, on the sensor nodes and will submit all data to the base station while recharging during the night. There is no need to establish permanent online connectivity from the sensor nodes to a base station (or gateway). From therapeutical point of view, it is merely required to gather statistics about ADL on daily basis, i.e. the patient’s ADL need to be available on the following day in the PHR. In addition, permanent wireless communication would unnecessarily and rapidly drain energy resources from the technical and usability point of view. Last but not least, it would require having a base station in reach of the BAN all day long. For example, the Bluetooth Low-Energy (BT-LE) communication module provides a solicited communication range of up to 10 m within a home environment only.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par54">According to this, the daily BAN data cycle is very simple as well as without the necessity to be triggered by the patient. In principle, the operational mode of the sensor nodes is divided into two phases only, i.e. recording data during the day, when the BAN is worn by the patient, and uploading data to the base station during night, when the sensor nodes reside in recharging position. Each sensor node automatically starts recording and storing data locally right after being removed from the power supply, respectively, the charging device. The sensor node keeps on recording data throughout the day as long as it is unplugged from the recharging station or the battery charge condition undergoes the minimum level required for proper functioning. If any communication between different sensors or between sensors and the base station is necessary, e.g. for synchronisation of time data or calibration issues, this is done automatically without patient intervention.</Para>

</Para>
            <Para ID="Par56">In addition, the StrokeBack sensor platform includes a magnetometer and sensors measuring vibration. Both sensory options may allow even more improved sensing skills to be investigated later on. Data from the accelerometer and the gyroscope are gathered in a frequency of 50 Hz in the basic setting, which equals to 50 samples per second or one sample every 20 ms, respectively. This is currently driven by parallel investigations using state-of-the-art sensor nodes, which do not support changing the sensing frequency with the given driver implementation. However, usage of lower sampling rates will in future be investigated to save memory and power consumption during operation.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par57">According to that, the expected data recorded throughout the day volume per sensor node and day sums up to a maximum of 50 MB. The accelerometer and the gyroscope sensor each provide three channels (<Emphasis Type="Italic">x</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">y</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">z</Emphasis> axes). Hence, the sensor node records 6 sensor values of 16 bit at every 20 ms. Together with a 64 bit timestamp, the sensor node will store a minimum of 6 × 16 bit (sensor values) + 64 bit (timestamp) at every 20 ms as raw sensor data. This is equal to 18 bytes (1 byte = 8 bit) at every 20 ms, which sums up to 900 bytes per second and node. In total, we assume to store approximately 1 Kbyte per second on the node. By recording approximately 1 Kbyte per second, one sensor node will record 3600 Kbyte per hour and therefore 43.2 MB pure sensor data during 12 h.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par58">All data gathered by the BAN are personal/private data of the patient that need to be protected from non-authorised access for the complete data lifetime, as already mentioned. Therefore, data transmitted from sensor nodes to the base station (and to the PHR later on) need to be protected against eavesdropping and malicious damages or changes. The StrokeBack system makes use of the AES protocol, which provides a symmetric cipher for encryption of data streams. Since it is symmetric, both the sender and the receiver need to know the secret encryption key to be able to access encrypted data. In the simplest setting, this secret key has to be selected during the configuration phase of the sensor nodes and cannot be changed during usage of the system. This approach may be suitable for controlled trials, but will become more or less unsecure when the StrokeBack system would be used in its envisioned application for daily rehabilitation monitoring, since the key can then not be changed during operation. Thus, anybody who possesses the configured AES key can then in principle access all data gathered by the system, regardless whether this access is permitted.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par59">To overcome these problems, the final BAN nodes are empowered by the IHP crypto-microcontroller that provides hardware for AES too, but additionally provides energy-efficient integrated hardware accelerators for the asymmetric cipher protocol ECC and the standardised Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) for generation of digital signatures and hashes. The latter can be used to detect unwanted or malicious changes of data, e.g. during wireless transmission. The hardware support for ECC (software variants for microcontrollers exist, but are much too heavy to be used on sensor nodes as side application) enables to implement a public–private key infrastructure in parallel even on the sensor nodes. This is used to implement access control directly on the sensor nodes and to enable secure exchange of new AES encryption keys at any time if needed. On the other hand, this ensures that no sender or receiver other than the authorised base station can communicate to the sensor nodes to exchange information or patient’s data.</Para>

That means, even if the clock of all sensor nodes is synchronised at the beginning of the day, e.g. during attachment, it may occur that the sensor data is not recorded exactly at the same time in parallel on all sensor nodes. Since sensor data is recorded at all nodes in intervals of 20 ms, the clock drift during the day must not exceed 10 ms in total to avoid incorrect correlation of motion data taken at different nodes. Communication facilities on the sensor nodes are to be used to synchronise all nodes and timestamps while recording data throughout the day.</Para>

          <Section2 ID="Sec16">
            <Heading>Communication</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par61">For all communication issues between the sensor nodes and the base station mentioned before, each sensor node is equipped with a wireless communication module. According to previous estimations, it is assumed to transfer about 50 MB of data in total for each sensor node in use per day, including overhead data required for instance for packet headers, checksums, MAC (Medium Access Control) and routing data. Provided that a patient wears three sensor nodes in parallel for the maximum setting (wrist, upper arm, chest), about 150 MB of data have to be transferred to the base station during the recharging phase (at night). Taking the minimum time slot of 5 h for charging and transmission of all nodes into account, the BAN needs to transfer about 30 MB per hour. This equals to 500 Kbyte per minute or about 8.3 Kbyte per second, respectively. To summarise, to comply with the requirements set above, the communication module of each sensor node should provide a minimum transfer rate of 10 Kbyte per second (80 Kbit/s).</Para>
            <Para ID="Par62">For wireless communication, the widely used Bluetooth (BT) standard has been investigated while focusing on using the more advanced BT-LE. Both would provide more than sufficient data rates to fulfil estimated transfer rates. The BT-LE allows data rates up to 1000 Kbit per second (1 Mbit/s). The BT standard even provides data rates of up to 2.1 Mbit/s (Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) mode), but usually consumes much more energy. Unfortunately, a dual BT front end that is compatible to both BT standards in parallel (called ‘BT Smart Ready’) was not available at the time of the design phase of the sensor nodes. Hence, a single BT-LE module was integrated.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par63">Estimated raw sensor data of course need to be stored at the node throughout the day. Flash is the currently most widely used technology of non-volatile memory for small devices. In principle, two options of flash memory are available for our application, i.e. tiny flash modules directly assembled on the sensor board or flash memory cards that can be exchanged. Both options are relatively cheap, but feature different advantages and drawback.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par64">Flash memory cards, or micro-SD cards in our case, are very cheap and available as mass product with capacities ranging from several hundred megabytes up to 64 Gigabyte. Further advantages are that they in principle are compatible to other devices and can be replaced easily and hence provide more flexibility. Their drawback is the required size for the SD-card slot on the board and their power consumption. Very small card slots still require a board area of about 12 × 12 mm, which is already half of the envisioned board size (refer to Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec24">3.9.1</InternalRef>). The power supply for micro-SD cards requires around 3.0–3.3 V.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par65">Flash modules for on-board assembly are slightly more expensive than SD-cards and provide less memory capacities. Nevertheless, such modules feature much smaller dimensions than a micro-SD slot and more important: the power consumption is significantly lower. Both features are of utmost importance for the StrokeBack sensor nodes. Hence, we decided to assemble a flash module with 128 MB storing capacity.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par66">Energy efficiency is one of the key aspects when it comes to design of sensor nodes. The more energy the sensor nodes consumes during operation, the more energy need to be available and stored on the nodes to reach a certain minimum operation time. The minimum operation time for each node is assumed 12 h, as introduced before. However, not only the amount of energy consumed by the node itself need to be minimised of course. Obviously, using larger battery packs would solve most of energy supply problems, but there are several aspects that need to be considered as well, in particular from the usability point of view. Larger battery packs might not fit into very small and lightweight sensor cases and will unnecessarily increase weight of the sensor node.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par67">Therefore, the StrokeBack BAN is supplied by very small rechargeable Lithium-Polymer batteries providing several hundred milliamps per hour (mAh). The sensors can commonly be charged via a standard micro-USB adapter. In addition, the StrokeBack sensor nodes integrate wireless power supply based on the Qi wireless power standard [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>] for automatically recharging batteries when the sensor node is in charging position. This will enable getting rid of cables and cable plugs and therefore significantly improve patient’s experiences and acceptance.</Para>

Therefore, the StrokeBack team investigated integration of a novel hardware module, called Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), for accelerating on-BAN movement classification while reducing the amount of recorded data at the same time.

The StrokeBack BAN is used for monitoring issues only and hence, it does not provide any actuators. Two more features may be considered, i.e. wireless communication and power supply. The exposure of wireless transmission should be kept minimal by reducing the communication frequency and transmission power. This can be neglected for the StrokeBack application scenario, since usage of radio transmission is almost reduced to recharging time when the patient does not wear the BAN. The power supply on the node is very low and the amount of energy stored is small. This should not be a risk for the patient. Furthermore, the charging module on the board includes autonomous temperature control and shuts down the sensor node in case of difficulty while charging and overheating problems.</Para>

          <Para ID="Par70">This section introduces the design and performance of the GHOST platform, which is a tiny sensor platform with inertial sensors, Qi compliant wireless power transfer and an embedded BT-LE (Bluetooth 4.0) front end. In a full package, the complete GHOST sensor platform is of matchbox size only, including a Lithium cell battery pack and a receiver coil for wireless power transfer. This platform is used for detection of ADL within the StrokeBack project, where the platform is worn by patient at the affected limb. It can collect movement data from accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer throughout the day, which is uploaded and analysed during the night when the sensor resides in the wireless charging station.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par71">Due to the investigation and implementation of a pre-processing ASIC for the crypto-microcontroller, two variants of the GHOST platform have been designed. In principle, both provide equal functionality as required for the project and trials. The first version is equipped with a state-of-the-art microcontroller of the MSP430x family from Texas Instruments (TI). In the following, this sensor platform is referred to as GHOSTv1. This platform has been rapidly prototyped for testing and necessary CE signing procedure and tests in a third party laboratory.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par72">The second and final version of the StrokeBack sensor node GHOSTv2 is empowered by an individualised crypto-microcontroller manufactured by IHP. This microcontroller is code-compatible to the MSP430x family from TI. The rest of the sensor node components mainly remain the same despite very small changes.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par73">A full list of chosen main components can be found in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">3.1</InternalRef>. Most of these components have been used on both platforms. However, differences in the set of integrated components between both platforms are marked.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab1">

It must further fully integrate the LiPo cell and the receiver coil too. Moreover, patients have repeatedly pointed out that the state-of-the-art sensor nodes are too large in height for comfortable and unperceived use, in particular when the sensor is placed at the wrist.

            <Para ID="Par99">The performance of the sensor platform in terms of power consumption is key to meet the desired working time of the platform. In current setting, the applied LiPo cell has a nominal power capacity of 250 mA h, which is one of the smallest LiPo cells available on the market. In contrast to that, the power consumption of the platform during storage of movement data, i.e. when the sensor is worn throughout the day, is at a maximum of 10 mA at the maximum sensing rate if accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer are used at 50 Hz data output in parallel. The power consumptions of different working modes of the GHOST platform are presented in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">3.2</InternalRef>. The average power consumption of GHOSTv1 is about 5 mA depending on the working frequency of the microcontroller. Thus, the platform might be in theory runnable for 50 h without recharging. However, all experiments done with the battery cells showed that the 250 mA h could not be reached in a real setting.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab2">

In contrast to standard AES encryption, the crypto-microcontroller enables using a significantly more secure public–private encryption infrastructure, where each sensor node in the BAN can take part in the encrypted communication without the need of exchanging a session key. In addition, knowledge about the public key of a data provider, which here is the sensor node worn at the wrist, enables the base station to authenticate the data transferred as well as the data source itself. Secondly, the sensors needed for the project, i.e. accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer have been incorporated into a single board to minimise the sensor node size, depicted in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig12">3.12</InternalRef>.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig12">

Each target colour has to be reached as fast as possible. The target colour is thereby pre-given by the therapist. To use such a therapy in StrokeBack, we embedded a sensor node into such a coloured cube on the one hand, and have implemented dedicated software with a GUI that wirelessly communicates with the sensor node on the other hand.

          <Para ID="Par115">This chapter introduces the design and performance of the GHOST platform, which is a tiny sensor platform with inertial sensors, Qi compliant wireless power transfer and an embedded BT-LE (Bluetooth 4.0) front end. In full package, the complete GHOST sensor platform is of matchbox size only, including a Lithium cell battery pack and a receiver coil for wireless power transfer. In addition, the second version of GHOST features a novel security chip offering efficient data encryption means using a highly secure ECC hardware.</Para>
          <Para ID="Par116">The GHOST sensor allows detection of daily living activities of people under rehabilitation. Following the prerequisites set by therapist and physicians, the use case scenario for patients is extremely user-friendly. The GHOST system is worn on the wrist of the affected arm like a watch. There are only two actions per day required by the patient, i.e. the patient has to take the sensor from the charging station and put it on the wrist in the morning, and merely put it back to the charging station in the evening. The sensor will automatically collect necessary data during the day and transfer it into a PHR over night while charging.</Para>
