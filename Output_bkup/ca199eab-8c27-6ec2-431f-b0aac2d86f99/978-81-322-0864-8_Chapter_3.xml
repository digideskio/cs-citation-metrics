          <Para TextBreak="No">Plankton means wonderers. There are two types of planktons, phytoplankton and zooplankton. Phytoplankton are plant plankton and zooplankton are animal plankton. Phytoplankton are autotrophic, prokaryotic or eukaryotic algae that live near the water surface where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. Among the more important groups are the diatoms, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates and coccolithophores. Zooplankton are small protozoans or metazoans (e.g. crustaceans and other animals) that feed on other plankton and telonemia. Some of the eggs and larvae of larger animals, such as fish, crustaceans and annelids, are included here. Bacterioplankton, bacteria and archaea, which play an important role in remineralising organic material down the water column. Individual zooplankton are usually too small to be seen with the naked eye, but some, such as jellyfish, are large. Zooplanktons are of various sizes of organism including small protozoans and large metazoans. It includes holoplanktonic organisms whose complete life cycle lies within the plankton as well as meroplanktonic organisms that spend part of their lives in the plankton before graduating to either the nekton or a sessile, benthic existence. Although zooplankton are primarily transported by ambient water currents, many have locomotion, used to avoid predators or to increase prey encounter rate. Important protozoan zooplankton groups ecologically include the foraminiferans, radiolarians and dinoflagellates. Metazoan zooplankton which are important include cnidarians such as jellyfish and the Portuguese man-of-war, crustaceans such as copepods and krill, chaetognaths (arrow worms), molluscs such as pteropods and chordates such as salps and juvenile fish. The counting of planktons and zooplankton is necessary to know about the flora and fauna of that particular area.</Para>

          <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The name plankton comes from the Greek word planktos meaning wanderers (Thurman <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">1997</CitationRef>). There are two types of plankton—phytoplankton and zooplankton. Phytoplankton are plant plankton. Zooplankton are animal plankton. Among the phytoplankton are seaweeds and algae. Phytoplankton are mostly made up of diatoms and dinoflagellates. Diatoms are microscopic, single-celled plants covered by two shells which look glossy. Dinoflagellates are tiny plants with white shells all over them. The shells have a whip-like motion that allows the phytoplankton to move. These are the types of phytoplankton that are found in the sea and they must be protected by all of us.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Phytoplankton lives near the surface of the water body because they need sunlight like all green plants. They also need water and nutrients to live. Phytoplankton use water and CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> to grow, but phytoplankton still need other vitamins and minerals, like iron to survive. When the surface of the ocean is cold, the deeper parts of the ocean bring these nutrients to the surface and the plankton live. But, when the surface of the water body is warm, as in El Niño, the water body does not bring as many of these essential nutrients and the phytoplankton die. That causes a major problem because phytoplankton are at the base of the food chain. So, when the population of phytoplankton is reduced almost, the entire food chain is affected. When phytoplankton die, they drop to the bottom of the ocean.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Phytoplankton use CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> for survival, which means that the more phytoplankton there are the more CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> will be sucked out of the air. When there is less CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> in the air, the temperature is going to be lower. When there is a smaller population of phytoplankton, there is more CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> in the air. This leads to higher temperatures. Phytoplankton are very important to life and humans should always protect them.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Plankton are any drifting organisms (plants, archaea or bacteria) that inhabit the pelagic zone of water body, seas or bodies of fresh water. That is, plankton are defined by their ecological niche rather than phylogenetic or taxonomic classification. They provide a crucial source of food to larger, more familiar aquatic organisms such as fish and whales.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Though many planktic species are microscopic in size, plankton include organisms covering a wide range of sizes, including large organisms such as jellyfish. Plankton typically flow with ocean currents. While some forms are capable of independent movement and can swim hundreds of metres vertically in a single day, their horizontal position is primarily determined by the surrounding currents. This is in contrast to nekton organisms that can swim against the ambient flow and control their position (e.g. squid, fish and marine mammals).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Within the plankton, holoplankton spend their entire life cycle as plankton (e.g. most algae, copepods, salps and some jellyfish). By contrast, meroplankton are only planktic for part of their lives (usually the larval stage) and then graduate to either a nektic or benthic (sea floor) existence. Examples of meroplankton include the larvae of sea urchins, starfish, crustaceans, marine worms and most fish. Plankton abundance and distribution are strongly dependent on factors such as ambient nutrient concentrations, the physical state of the water column and the abundance of other plankton. The widespread use of planktonic in both scientific and popular literature is grammatically incorrect because of the Greek roots of plankton.</Para>

          <Heading>Trophic Groups</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Plankton are primarily divided into broad functional (or trophic level) groups:</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Phytoplankton (from Greek <Emphasis Type="Italic">phyton</Emphasis>, or plant), autotrophic, prokaryotic or eukaryotic algae that live near the water surface where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. Among the more important groups are the diatoms, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates and coccolithophores.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Zooplankton (from Greek <Emphasis Type="Italic">zoon</Emphasis>, or animal), small protozoans or metazoans (e.g. crustaceans and other animals) that feed on other plankton and telonemia. Some of the eggs and larvae of larger animals, such as fish, crustaceans and annelids, are included here.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Bacterioplankton, bacteria and archaea play an important role in remineralising organic material down the water column.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">This scheme divides the plankton community into broad producer, consumer and recycler groups. However, determining the trophic level of some plankton is not straightforward. For example, although most dinoflagellates are either photosynthetic producers or heterotrophic consumers, many species are mixotrophic depending upon circumstances.</Para>

            <Heading>Size Groups</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Plankton are also often described in terms of size (Omori and Ikeda <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">1992</CitationRef>). Usually the following divisions are used:<Table Float="Yes" ID="Taba">

            <Para TextBreak="No">However, some of these terms may be used with very different boundaries, especially on the larger end of the scale. The existence and importance of nano- and even smaller plankton was only discovered during the 1980s, but they are thought to make up the largest proportion of all plankton in number and diversity. The microplankton and smaller groups are microorganisms and operate at low Reynolds numbers, where the viscosity of water is much more important than its mass or inertia (Dusenbery <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
            <Section3 ID="Sec4">
              <Heading>Distribution</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Plankton inhabit oceans, seas, lakes and ponds. Local abundance varies horizontally, vertically and seasonally. The primary cause of this variability is the availability of light. All plankton ecosystems are driven by the input of solar energy, confining primary production to surface waters and to geographical regions and seasons having abundant light. A secondary variable is nutrient availability. Although large areas of the tropical and subtropical oceans have abundant light, they experience relatively low primary production because they offer limited nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and silicate. This results from large-scale ocean circulation in water body and water column stratification. In such regions, primary production usually occurs at greater depth, although at a reduced level.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Despite significant macronutrient concentrations, some oceans are unproductive (Martin Martin and Fitzwater <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">1988</CitationRef>). The micronutrient iron is deficient in these regions, and adding it can lead to the formation of blooms of many kinds of phytoplankton (Boyd et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2000</CitationRef>). Iron primarily reaches the ocean through the deposition of dust on the sea surface. Paradoxically, oceanic areas adjacent to unproductive, arid land thus typically have abundant phytoplankton. While plankton are most abundant in surface waters, they live throughout the water column. At depths where no primary production occurs, zooplankton and bacterioplankton instead consume organic material sinking from more productive surface waters above. This flux of sinking material, so-called marine snow, can be especially high following the termination of spring blooms.</Para>

                <Heading>Biogeochemical Significance</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Aside from representing the bottom few levels of a food chain that supports commercially important fisheries, plankton ecosystems play a role in the biogeochemical cycles of many important chemical elements, including the ocean’s carbon cycle. Primarily by grazing on phytoplankton, zooplankton provide carbon to the planktic food web, either respiring it to provide metabolic energy or upon death as biomass or detritus. Typically more dense than seawater, organic material tends to sink. In open ocean, ecosystems away from the coasts transport carbon from surface to deep waters. This process is known as the biological pump and is one reason that oceans constitute the largest carbon sink on Earth. It might be possible to increase the ocean’s uptake of carbon dioxide generated through human activities by increasing plankton production through ‘seeding’, primarily with the micronutrient iron. However, this technique may not be practical at a large scale. Ocean oxygen depletion and resultant methane production is one potential drawback (Chisholm et al <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2001</CitationRef>; Aumont and Bopp <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>

                  <Heading>Biomass Variability</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">The growth of phytoplankton populations is dependent on light levels and nutrient availability, and the chief factor limiting growth varies from region to region in the world’s oceans. On a broad scale, growth of phytoplankton in the oligotrophic tropical and subtropical gyres is generally limited by nutrient supply, while light often limits phytoplankton growth in subarctic gyres. Environmental variability at multiple scales influences the nutrient and light available for phytoplankton, and as these organisms form the base of the fresh and marine food web, this variability in phytoplankton growth influences higher trophic levels. For example, at interannual scales phytoplankton levels temporarily plummet during El Nino periods, influencing populations of zooplankton, fishes, sea birds and marine mammals.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">The effects of anthropogenic warming on the global population of phytoplankton are an area of active research. Changes in the vertical stratification of the water column, the rate of temperature-dependent biological reactions and the atmospheric supply of nutrients are expected to have important impacts on future phytoplankton productivity. Additionally, changes in the mortality of phytoplankton due to rates of zooplankton grazing may be significant.</Para>

                    <Emphasis Type="Italic">Importance to fish.</Emphasis> Zooplankton are the initial prey item for almost all fish larvae as they switch from their yolk sacs to external feeding. Fish rely on the density and distribution of zooplankton to match that of new larvae, which can otherwise starve. Natural factors (e.g. current variations) and man-made factors (e.g. river dams) can strongly affect zooplankton, which can in turn strongly affect larval survival and therefore breeding success.</Para>

          <Heading>Zooplankton</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Individual zooplankton are usually too small to be seen with the naked eye, but some, such as jellyfish, are large. Zooplanktons are of various sizes of organism including small protozoans and large metazoans. It includes holoplanktonic organisms whose complete life cycle lies within the plankton, as well as meroplanktonic organisms that spend part of their lives in the plankton before graduating to either the nekton or a sessile, benthic existence. Although zooplankton are primarily transported by ambient water currents, many have locomotion, used to avoid predators or to increase prey encounter rate. Important protozoan zooplankton groups ecologically include the foraminiferans, radiolarians and dinoflagellates. Metazoan zooplankton which are important include cnidarians such as jellyfish and the Portuguese man-of-war, crustaceans such as copepods and krill, chaetognaths (arrow worms), molluscs such as pteropods and chordates such as salps and juvenile fish. This wide phylogenetic range includes a similarly wide range in feeding behaviour: filter feeding, predation and symbiosis with autotrophic phytoplankton as seen in corals. Zooplankton feed on bacterioplankton, phytoplankton, other zooplankton, detritus and even nektonic organisms. Due to this, zooplankton are primarily found in surface waters where food resources (phytoplankton or other zooplankton) are abundant.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Just as any species can be limited within a geographical region, so is zooplankton. However, species of zooplankton are not dispersed uniformly or randomly within a region of the ocean. Instead ‘patches’ of zooplankton species (this also applies to phytoplankton) exist throughout the ocean. Though few physical barriers exist above the mesopelagic, specific species of zooplankton are strictly restricted by salinity and temperature gradients, while other species can withstand wide temperature and salinity gradients (Jude et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2005</CitationRef>). Zooplankton patchiness can also be influenced by biological factors, as well as other physical factors. Biological factors include breeding, predation, concentration of phytoplankton and vertical migration. The physical factor that influences zooplankton distribution the most is mixing of the water column (upwelling and downwelling along the coast and in the open ocean) that affects nutrient availability and, in turn, phytoplankton production (Jude et al <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Through their consumption and processing of phytoplankton and other food sources, zooplankton play a role in aquatic food webs, as a resource for consumers on higher trophic levels (including fish) and as a conduit for packaging the organic material in the biological pump. Since they are typically small, zooplankton can respond rapidly to increases in phytoplankton abundance, for instance, during the spring bloom. Zooplankton can also act as a disease reservoir. They have been found to house the bacterium <Emphasis Type="Italic">Vibrio cholerae</Emphasis>, which causes cholera, by allowing the cholera vibrios to attach to their chitinous exoskeletons. This symbiotic relationship enhances the bacterium’s ability to survive in an aquatic environment, as the exoskeleton provides the bacterium with carbon and nitrogen.</Para>

Since the water sampler collects whole water samples, all size planktons are collected. Different sizes of plankton may be separated subsequently from whole water samples through netting by the appropriate mesh size. Appropriate mesh sizes are selected for concentrating the various size categories of plankton typical of aquatic system under study. For collection of micro-zooplankton such as protozoans, rotifers and immature crustaceans, 20- to 200-μm net is used. The larger and mature crustaceans may be concentrated by passing through a 20-μm mesh net (APHA <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>

A mild detergent is placed on the chamber before counting to reduce movements of organisms. Count the organisms using compound microscope and a magnification of 100 ×. A Sedgewick Rafter cell is not suitable because of size. Smaller zooplankton as number per litre and larger forms as number per cubic metre should be reported.<Equation ID="Eque">
