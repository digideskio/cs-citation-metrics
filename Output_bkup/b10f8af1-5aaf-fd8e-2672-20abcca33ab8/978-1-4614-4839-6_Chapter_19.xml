              <Para TextBreak="No">Illnesses and injuries in the workplace have a considerable impact that go beyond the ill-health and suffering of the affected individual. The broader socioeconomic impact of workplace illnesses and injuries include reduced workplace productivity, creating a dangerous work environment, increasing healthcare costs, and potentially increased liability assessments through workers’ compensation ­premiums. This chapter discusses primary and secondary prevention strategies suitable for implementation at the workplace. An overview of the principles of preventive medicine is presented, with a description and broad goals for primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary prevention strategies. Following this, a review of the theoretical framework that was developed to address prevention strategies and health promotion behaviors is discussed, with a focus on the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health Belief Model</Emphasis>, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Theory of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior</Emphasis>, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Precaution Adoption Process Model</Emphasis>, and the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Transtheoretical Model</Emphasis>. Finally, overviews of primary and secondary prevention strategies are discussed for common diseases and illness prevalent in the workplace, including prevention of occupational injuries and disability, smoking, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mental health disorders.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">At the outset, it should again be noted that illnesses and injuries in the workplace have a ­considerable impact that go beyond the affected individual. There are broader socioeconomic impacts of such workplace illnesses and injuries as have been discussed in other chapters of this handbook. For ­example, in the United States, the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) compiles annual reports of workplace illnesses and injuries across all public and private organizations nationwide. The most recent statistics from the BLS indicate that approximately 3.8 cases of non-fatal workplace injuries and illness per 100 full-time workers were recorded for the 2010 fiscal year, including 1.8 cases (per 100 workers) that involved days away from work, job transfers, or job restrictions (Bureau of Labor Statistics, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001912">2011</CitationRef>). Among the total reported cases, 95% of these cases involved workplace injuries, while the remaining 5% were due to ­occupational-related illness (the majority being skin diseases/disorders, respiratory conditions, poisonings, and hearing loss). Over the last decade, statistics have also identified mental health disorders as another significant contributor to workplace disability, and also potentially as a risk factor for injuries and illnesses (The World Health Organization, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001956">2004</CitationRef>). In the United States, the population prevalence of mental health disorders for adults over the age of 18 is approximately 26%, with nearly half these affected individuals suffering from comorbid mental health disorders (i.e., two or more mental health diagnoses) (Kessler et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001929">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The financial impact of workplace injuries and illnesses are also quite immense. The total annual cost of workplace injuries and illnesses were estimated to be $250 billion (Leigh, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001932">2011</CitationRef>). Of this figure, only 27% of the costs were attributed to medical costs, while the remaining 73% of costs were associated with indirect costs (e.g., lost productivity, indemnity payments, litigation). Furthermore, a significant portion of medical costs are associated with medications, especially narcotic analgesics, at a cost of approximately $13.8 billion annually (Krueger &amp; Stone, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001931">2008</CitationRef>). Narcotic analgesics such as opioids, especially, may result in further complications, such as dependence disorders, prescription misuse, medication diversion, and deaths from overdose, further adding to the long-term costs of the injury or illness (Paulozzi et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001945">2012</CitationRef>). However, despite these relatively high incidence rates and associated costs, it is worth noting that, between the years 2003 and 2010, the United States has seen a decreasing trend in the incidence of workplace injuries and illnesses, corresponding to approximately a 30% reduction in incidence rate (Bureau of Labor Statistics, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001912">2011</CitationRef>). One contributing factor to this decrease is the greater emphasis on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of prevention strategies in reducing the risks of injuries and illnesses. Recently, the US Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA) published a “white paper” documenting the positive results from a decade’s worth of promoting injury and illness prevention programs across the US (Occupational Health and Safety Administration, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001944">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The present chapter will aid in understanding exactly why such prevention programs are effective in reducing the risks of injuries and illnesses in the workplace, with a specific focus on primary and secondary prevention strategies. A discussion of the levels of prevention strategies provides an overview of primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary prevention strategies. This is followed by a review of the prevailing theoretical models that account for the effectiveness of such prevention strategies, and their effect on an individual’s behavior in successfully complying and adhering to prevention programs. Finally, the chapter reviews several effective strategies and programs for primary and secondary prevention applicable to a broad list of medical conditions and health-related issues, with recommendations for future directions using novel technology and strategies.</Para>

              <Heading>Prevention Strategies</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The field of preventive medicine underscores four strategies, differing in level of services, that can be broadly classified as primary prevention, secondary prevention, tertiary prevention, and quaternary prevention. Each of these preventive strategies target individuals who are at different stages of disease progression, and require different strategies for managing the disease state (or risk of disease). Central to understanding these strategies of preventive medicine is the distinction between <Emphasis Type="Italic">disease</Emphasis> versus <Emphasis Type="Italic">illness</Emphasis>. In the broadest sense, <Emphasis Type="Italic">disease</Emphasis> corresponds to the specific medical or physiological state that defines a deviation from healthy functioning, whereas <Emphasis Type="Italic">illness</Emphasis> corresponds to the individual’s response set of behaviors to the underlying symptoms of the disease (Helman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001926">1981</CitationRef>). In this regard, it is possible for one to manifest itself without the other although, in most chronic stages of disease progression, both <Emphasis Type="Italic">disease</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">illness</Emphasis> co-occur.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00193">
                <Heading>Primary Prevention</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Primary prevention strategies target individuals who currently have no disease or illness present. This is a proactive prevention strategy at the most basic level, and is targeted to the general population. The goal here is to preempt the development of disease, by promoting healthy lifestyles, behaviors and strategies. Interventions, in the broadest sense, may include health education programs, policies and guidelines, and immunizations. Specific examples include smoking cessation programs, nutritional guidelines, and workplace guidelines on physical exertion associated with activities such as lifting heavy objects. Generally, these primary prevention strategies are low-cost with little-to-none in terms of potential to cause harm or side-effects (Leutwyler, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001933">1995</CitationRef>). In addition, primary prevention strategies are highly effective in maintaining healthy lifestyles, and are associated with lower risk of developing diseases and increased lifespan (Fraser &amp; Shavlik, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001921">2001</CitationRef>). As discussed by Brannon and Feist (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>), there is also a significant multiplier effect obtained from primary prevention strategies (pp. 478–497). For example, a combination of healthy behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation, balanced diet, regular exercise) can decrease the risk of developing several types of disorders such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00194">
                <Heading>Secondary Prevention</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Secondary prevention strategies are designed to screen for potential signs of diseases at its extant stages, so that a proper diagnosis can be determined and treatment be administered at an early stage to prevent further morbidity. The underlying strategy here is to target individuals who have one or more risk factors for the disease. For example, individuals who have higher than normal blood sugar levels should screen themselves routinely to ensure that they keep blood sugar levels in check. At this stage, illness behaviors are not apparent, and the disease is often treatable or successfully managed if discovered early. Interventions at this stage often consist of specific screening to determine a diagnosis, and to subsequently treat the condition at its acute stage. It should be noted that secondary prevention is much more costly, and therefore appropriately targeted to individuals in high-risk groups for developing a disease (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>). Nevertheless, it is an important component in the healthcare system, because detecting and treating diseases at an early stage would likely prevent further development into a chronic illness, which will have far more costly consequences (due to deteriorating health and increased use of healthcare resources that are required to treat or manage the resulting complex sequelae of disease progression).</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00195">
                <Heading>Tertiary Prevention</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The tertiary level of prevention strategies are needed when both primary and secondary strategies have either failed or were not implemented. The tertiary stage is the first stage at which both disease and illness are present (Norman &amp; Tesser, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001941">2009</CitationRef>). Tertiary prevention strategies are designed to manage the disease and illness by preventing the further exacerbation of the disease, restoring normal function to the patient where applicable, and preventing further complications. Oftentimes, specific modalities to treat the disease are part of the tertiary prevention strategy, but it can also include greater surveillance and monitoring of the patient’s condition, as well as more intensive levels of patient education and engagement by the healthcare provider to ensure that the patient adheres to the recommended treatment plan. Examples of tertiary prevention strategies can include prescription medications, invasive interventions such as surgery, or non-invasive interventions such as structured rehabilitation and exercise regimens. Needless to say, the cost factor is considerably elevated at this stage of disease and illness management, relative to primary and secondary prevention strategies.</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00196">
                <Heading>Quaternary Prevention</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The final type of prevention strategy differs from the previous three, in that it is designed to reduce excessive utilization of healthcare resources and interventions. The focus is primarily on stemming any negative consequences that can arise from unnecessary interventions, such as side effects of ­medications or complications from procedures (Norman &amp; Tesser, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001941">2009</CitationRef>). Patients targeted at this stage often manifest illness behaviors, but with no corresponding disease states as determined by healthcare providers. In these cases, the “usual care” modalities fail to achieve satisfactory outcomes (for example, among patients who suffer from chronic pain). Examples of quaternary prevention for such cases include recent guidelines on chronic opioid therapy, requiring a taper-down from excessively high-doses of prescription opioids if adequate pain relief and functional improvements are not observed (Agency Medical Directors Group, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00191">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Heading>Factors and Barriers to Modifying Health Behaviors: The Theoretical Framework</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The successful modifying of health behaviors is the central concept in prevention strategies, ­especially in primary and secondary stages of prevention. There are several prevailing theoretical models that account for some of the variation observed in health behaviors, and that reliably explain the factors that contribute towards, as well as barriers against, modifying health behaviors to ensure a healthy lifestyle and prevention of diseases and illness. These models, all of which emphasize biopsychosocial factors that influence behavior, include the following: the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health Belief Model</Emphasis>, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Theory of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior</Emphasis>, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Precaution Adoption Process Model</Emphasis>, and the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Transtheoretical Model</Emphasis>. Following an overview of each of these models, a brief discussion on the success of these models in predicting health behaviors is presented.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00198">
                <Heading>The Health Belief Model</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health Belief Model</Emphasis> underscores the importance of <Emphasis Type="Italic">beliefs</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">common sense</Emphasis> in an individual’s health-seeking and health-promoting behaviors (Hochbaum, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001927">1958</CitationRef>; Becker &amp; Rosenstock, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001910">1984</CitationRef>). Four beliefs are identified in the model that, in combination, predicts an individual’s health behavior. These are (1) perceived susceptibility to disease, (2) perceived severity of the disease, (3) perceived benefits of health-enhancing behaviors, and (4) perceived barriers to health-enhancing behaviors. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health Belief Model</Emphasis> predicts that individuals should actively modify their behavior accordingly, or seek appropriate healthcare, when they perceive susceptibility for a disease, and believe that they can benefit from overcoming barriers to effecting healthy behaviors. The model assumes a linear progression from one component of belief to the next, across the four categories of health beliefs. Although this would imply a common sense approach to effecting modified behavior for the better, research has indicated that behavioral outcomes often do not comply very well with the “theory of action” that the model predicts.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Several major factors account for the mismatch between the hypothesized course of action, and the actual behavior observed. First, barriers may arise due to perceived health risks or potential ­discomfort from engaging in the behavior predicted. A common example of this would be fear of a suffering from a heart attack (the risk) due to engaging in any physical activity or exercise regimen (the predicted healthy behavior) (O’Brien Cousins, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001942">2003</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001943">2000</CitationRef>). A second contributing factor is that individuals may also be inhibited to action by an unrealistic sense of optimism or invulnerability, by assuming that they have a lower-than-average risk for developing the disease. Therefore, despite recognizing the benefits of a course of action towards modifying their behavior, they are lulled into a false sense of security, and this perpetuates any high risk behaviors they are engaging in. This inflated sense of ­optimism is also correlated with age, with younger individuals more likely to assume a sense of invulnerability (Madey &amp; Gomez, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001934">2003</CitationRef>). Third, socioeconomic and demographic factors, specifically poverty and ethnic/cultural background, may also play a role in countering the assumption of the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health Belief Model</Emphasis>, when issues such as costs of healthcare, access to healthcare, and subjective norms about treatment-seeking may dictate whether or not an individual adheres to the linear progression of endorsing the four beliefs and subsequently modifying their behavior (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) (pp. 47–49). Finally, another significant contributing factor is an individual’s sense of personal control; the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health Belief Model</Emphasis> posits external factors as guiding the individual’s behavior, but does not account for the fact that an individual may ultimately make a choice whether or not to engage in a course of action towards beneficial behavior (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) (pp. 47–49).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Although founded on the assumption of common sense, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health Belief Model</Emphasis> is weakened by individuals’ succumbing to the effect of <Emphasis Type="Italic">irrational beliefs</Emphasis>, the effect of <Emphasis Type="Italic">reasoned action</Emphasis> guided by their own attitudes in weighing risks and benefits, and subjective norms that guide health-seeking behaviors. Therefore, a more complex formulation was needed to account for the variance observed in individuals’ health-related behaviors that were counter to the predictions of the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health Belief Model</Emphasis>. The following theories discussed below build upon the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health Belief Model</Emphasis>, especially by accounting for an individual’s level of self-efficacy in effecting the required changes in behavior.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Theory of Reasoned Action</Emphasis> incorporated several of the elements not accounted for by the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health Belief Model</Emphasis>. Departing from the notion that beliefs alone direct behavior, this theory emphasizes an individual’s <Emphasis Type="Italic">intention</Emphasis> to engage in a course of action as the primary determinant of behavior (Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00194">1980</CitationRef>; Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001918">1975</CitationRef>). That intention itself is moderated by two additional ­factors, specifically one’s attitude towards the desired behavior, as well as subjective norms (e.g., cultural, societal, or peer pressure) that may influence an individual’s intention to engage in the desired behavior. In turn, each of these is moderated by two other higher order factors. The theory predicts that attitude is shaped by the individual’s underlying beliefs about the benefits of the desired course of action. Subjective norms, on the other hand, are shaped by societal influence and endorsement of the desired course of action.

This modified model, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Theory of Planned Behavior</Emphasis>, incorporated perceived behavioral control as a moderator of attitude and norms (Ajzen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00192">1985</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00193">1991</CitationRef>). This theory predicted that perceived behavioral control increases an individual’s intention to engage in the desired course of action, if that individual believes they can easily achieve the desired behavior. This model predicts both direct and indirect effects of perceived control on intention, with the indirect effects achieved through moderating attitude (more positive attitude with increased perceived control) and subjective norms (override norms that discourage the desired course of action).

                <Para TextBreak="No">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Precaution Adoption Process Model</Emphasis> (Weinstein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001960">1988</CitationRef>) departs from the previous ones in two major ways. First of all, this is the first of the models to predict that individuals do not progress from stage to stage in the cycle of health behavior modification, but can even move backwards in stages and situations of relapse. Second of all, the model posits that the presence of an optimistic bias moderates an individual’s response to engaging in behavior modification. The entire model consists of seven stages of belief about an individual’s perceived susceptibility to developing a disease. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig00193">19.3</InternalRef> illustrates these stages of belief, with a brief description of the nature of beliefs that individuals hold at each stage. While <Emphasis Type="Italic">Stage 1</Emphasis> describes a situation where an individual is unaware of the risk factors for developing a disease, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Stage 2</Emphasis> beliefs emphasize the presence of the optimism bias among those individuals who are aware of the risk present in their lives. At this second stage, however, individuals do not believe that the disease would befall them, although they are aware of the risk factors present and acknowledge that the risk factors can predispose one to developing the disease. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Stage 3</Emphasis> consists of individuals’ acceptance that risk factors present in their lives do pose a risk for developing disease, but have not decided on taking action to modify health behaviors. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Stages 4 and 5</Emphasis> denote a decision point, where individuals’ decide and make a commitment to modify their health behavior by engaging in a particular activity or treatment (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Stage 4</Emphasis>), or they may decide against taking any actions due to some other perceived ill effect of undergoing any treatment (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Stage 5</Emphasis>). It is possible for individuals in <Emphasis Type="Italic">Stage 5</Emphasis> to go backwards in the process of formulating beliefs. Specifically, the model proposes the possibility that an individual may decide to undergo a process of behavioral modification and go back to <Emphasis Type="Italic">Stage 4</Emphasis>. Finally, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Stages 6 and 7</Emphasis> involve individuals who recognize their risk and susceptibility to disease and are actively engaging in behavior modification (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Stage 6</Emphasis>), or have advanced even further and are now in the process of maintenance (i.e., sustaining their new course of action towards a healthier lifestyle; <Emphasis Type="Italic">Stage 7</Emphasis>).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00193">

Additionally, the model also explicitly recognizes that individuals at different stages will require different methods of intervention to help them achieve their goals (Armitage et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00197">2004</CitationRef>). Therefore, targeted interventions, taking into account an individual’s own history, beliefs, and motivation, would likely yield the best outcomes in effecting successful change in behavior.</Para>

                <Heading>The Success of the Theoretical Models</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">How well does the theoretical framework account for behaviors observed in clinical practice? Brannon and Feist (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) provide a useful discussion and critique of each of these models (pp. 53–55). In sum, there is moderate evidence for these models. However, where these models fall short are in their exclusion of significant contributing factors, such as secondary gain, socioeconomic disparities, and lack of access to quality healthcare. Furthermore, systematic reviews of the literature have also noted that such models often vary in their predictive ability across disease states (Rosen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001949">2000</CitationRef>), and therefore should not be relied upon too heavily without proper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the illness behaviors associated with any given unique disease. However, the theoretical framework does provide useful concepts to guide effective interventions for Primary and Secondary Prevention strategies. The following section discusses several different disease states/­illnesses, and some useful methods for prevention that are grounded in the theoretical frameworks discussed above.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">The successful application of the theoretical models described in the previous section has resulted in effective primary and secondary prevention strategies and interventions that are routinely deployed in the clinical setting. When used within the primary care setting, these prevention strategies are able to reach a wide population of individuals who seek routine care. Incorporating prevention strategies within occupational settings provide an even larger target population that may benefit from the ­principles of preventive medicine. This section provides a brief overview of several prevention ­methods used in the clinical and occupational settings, with an emphasis on preventing and managing unintentional injuries that could lead to pain and disability, consumption of tobacco, risk factors for cardiovascular disease, risk factors for cancer, and risk factors for mental health disorders. The underlying philosophy in primary and secondary prevention strategies involves modification of behavior using a multifaceted method, as summarized in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00191">19.1</InternalRef>.

                <Heading>Prevention Strategies for Occupational Injuries</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Occupational injuries resulting in workers compensation claims and time off work are primarily caused by overexertion. In a survey conducted by Liberty Mutual, slightly more than 25% of all ­compensable workplace injuries fall under this category, and are due to excessive lifting, pushing, pulling, holding, carrying or throwing of an object (Michael, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001938">2001</CitationRef>). These injuries also account for approximately $9.8 billion (in 1998 US $) in direct healthcare costs. Primary prevention strategies suitable for the workplace should therefore ideally consist of a combination of a safe and conducive workplace environment, workplace policies and guidelines on safety, and training and support provided to the worker. The goal here is to elevate the individual worker’s attitudes and beliefs about workplace safety from knowledge to action and finally to maintenance, in as rapid a manner as possible. However, it is often the case that, even with adequate attention to these factors, workplace risks are not adequately controlled. Complicating the matter further is the fact that there is little knowledge about the causal factors that lead to chronic disability resulting from workplace injuries, even relatively minor ones (Frank &amp; Cullen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001920">2006</CitationRef>). Therefore, designing truly comprehensive and targeted primary prevention methods for occupational injuries is often not feasible for any given organization beyond very broad policies, training material, and ergonomic improvements. However, there are at least two principles that can help enhance the effectiveness of primary injury prevention strategies in the occupational setting. First, a key component to increase compliance to safety protocols and to adhere to principles of training programs is to provide feedback about performance to the individual worker (Schultz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001951">2004</CitationRef>). Second, but most importantly, the principles of primary prevention should be a “top-down approach” (i.e., the literature on occupational disability shows evidence that individual behavior at the workplace is strongly influenced by the attitude towards safety cultivated by management) (DeJoy et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001916">2004</CitationRef>; Mullen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001940">2004</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Secondary prevention for workplace injuries has been relatively well developed over the past few decades. The key here is to prevent the emergence of chronic disability once a worker has already sustained an injury. This should be a multipronged approach designed to control symptoms, reduce disability, and optimize functional status (Frank &amp; Cullen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001920">2006</CitationRef>). Therefore, the major component of secondary prevention is to ensure the availability of effective disability management interventions. Treatment modalities at this level include the following: structured exercise programs, functional training for improving general health and work capacity, and cognitive-behavioral interventions designed to address psychosocial barriers to recovery that play a role in the development of chronicity. These are often accomplished through structured work conditioning and work hardening programs, with low-intensity psychosocial interventions to help with coping skills and identifying barriers to recovery (Mayer &amp; Press, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001936">2005</CitationRef>; Mayer et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001937">2006</CitationRef>). In addition, it is also a benefit to the worker if organizational policies incorporate temporary modified work protocols, or even vocational retraining to accommodate any permanent levels of disability, if feasible (Frank &amp; Cullen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001920">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Presently, it is common for primary and secondary prevention strategies to be fragmented in terms of delivery. For example, organizations are often only mandated to be responsible for primary ­prevention strategies, while secondary prevention is outsourced to healthcare delivery organizations often dictated by third-party payors (Frank &amp; Cullen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001920">2006</CitationRef>; Gatchel &amp; Okifuji, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001924">2006</CitationRef>). However, the literature indicates that an integrated primary-secondary prevention approach at the organizational level is often more effective (Yassi et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001961">1995a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001962">1995b</CitationRef>). This combined strategy should incorporate not only ergonomic improvements, policies and training, but also the establishing of workplace committees on disability management and to negotiate with insurance carriers for the availability of ­multidisciplinary care teams to provide a comprehensive, biopsychosocial oriented treatment approach to prevent ­development of chronic disability (Frank &amp; Cullen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001920">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">The primary mode for consumption of tobacco is through smoking of cigarettes. Although there has been a sharp decline of approximately 42% in the prevalence of cigarette smoking in the United States since the 1960s, that rate has been at a relatively standstill pattern between 2005 and 2010 (Center for Disease Control, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001913">2011</CitationRef>). The prevalence rate of cigarette smoking among the working adult population in the United States stands at approximately 19% (Center for Disease Control, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001913">2011</CitationRef>). The importance of prevention strategies against smoking is underscored by the link between smoking and a myriad of undesirable and serious health outcomes, such as developing a variety of cancers, cardiovascular disorders, respiratory disorders, and increased susceptibility to mental health and other substance abuse problems (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) (pp. 358–360). The major factors that can benefit from targeted prevention strategies include addiction to nicotine, the habitual effect of smoking, the optimistic bias that causes one to underestimate their personal health risks, and the fear of weight gain from quitting (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) (pp. 355–357).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Primary prevention strategies against smoking are based on the goal of deterring smoking in the first place. In the workplace, this is usually not feasible, since the initial choice to smoke may have been made far earlier in the life of the working adult. However, certain primary prevention strategies that may deter smoking at the workplace can include a total ban on smoking anywhere around the workplace. Such policies have often gone into effect at universities and medical centers, which are designated as “smoke-free areas,” and include the outdoor areas of the property in question. This method may be effective as it replicates some of the relatively more successful strategies employed to deter smoking. For example, while information alone about the health risks of smoking has been totally ineffective for deterrence (Siegel &amp; Biener, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001952">2000</CitationRef>), information in combination with community-wide antismoking campaigns have demonstrated favorable long-term outcomes in avoiding that habit-forming first step of lighting up a cigarette (Vartiainen et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001959">1998</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Secondary prevention techniques are more suitable for a workplace setting, especially when ­combined with a “smoke-free” organizational policy. The goal here should be multifaceted by combining information along with support mechanisms and interventions that can be provided within healthy lifestyle programs within the organization itself, or through the managed healthcare organization that is partnered with through the organization’s healthcare benefits program. Secondary interventions may include information and successful self-management strategies for quitting without therapy (i.e., “cold turkey”), and information and support for quitting with various types of interventional therapies. The latter may include nicotine replacement therapy (patches, gum, lozenges, nasal sprays), psychosocial interventions (motivational interviewing techniques, enhancing self-efficacy), and workplace community campaigns that provide the required social support for maintenance of successful cessation of smoking and prevention of relapse (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) (pp. 363–368). The ultimate goal in such strategies should be multipronged. Based on the framework of the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Transtheoretical Model</Emphasis>, dissemination of information should be designed to move smokers from the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Precontemplation Stage</Emphasis> to the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Contemplation Stage</Emphasis>. Once achieved, the goal is to direct the individuals to the necessary resources (often the healthcare delivery organization responsible for the workplace) to initiate action, and then to successfully maintain the successful outcome. Most importantly, especially for smokers, is the enhancement of self-efficacy throughout the process of quitting, as relapse is a common ­occurrence (Fiore et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001917">1996</CitationRef>). The goal here is to then utilize the occurrence of relapse as a learning strategy to identify weaknesses, reshape the event to focus on enhancing self-efficacy to the previously successful attempt (no matter how brief), and to chart a modified behavioral strategy to successfully quit (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) (pp. 367–368).</Para>

                <Heading>Prevention Strategies for Cardiovascular Diseases</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Cardiovascular disease (CVD; which has also been reviewed in another chapter of this handbook) is the leading cause of death, accounting for 37% of all deaths in the United States (Hoyert, Kung, &amp; Smith, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001928">2005</CitationRef>). This is despite the fact that that there has been a dramatic reduction in deaths due to CVD since the 1960s, from a peak of 522 deaths per 100,000 in the 1960s down to 317 per 100,000 in 2002 (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) (p. 226). Risk factors for CVD include the following: biological/genetic (advancing age, family history, gender, ethnic background), physiological (hypertension, serum cholesterol level), and behavioral and psychosocial factors (smoking, diet, physical activity, social support, stress, anxiety, depression, anger, and hostility) (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) (pp. 228–240). Prevention strategies targeting behavioral risk factors and promoting surveillance of physiological risk factors for CVD, when employed at the workplace, are beneficial in terms of improving worker’s health, promoting healthy lifestyles, reducing time lost from work due to illness, preventing worker mortality due to CVD, and keeping organizational healthcare premiums down. Therefore, both primary and secondary prevention strategies targeted for the occupational setting can be mutually beneficial for both the individual workers, as well as the organization.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Primary prevention strategies for CVD are designed with the goal to prevent the first heart attack, whereas secondary prevention strategies for CVD are designed to rehabilitate cardiac patients and to prevent subsequent CVD events such as a heart attack (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) (pp. 241–245). While secondary prevention strategies, specifically cardiac rehabilitation, are best managed at the healthcare delivery organization responsible for the patient, the goal of enhancing and maintaining healthy lifestyle choices for the CVD patient can benefit from primary prevention strategies already well-­developed and suitable for promotion at the workplace. Both primary and secondary prevention strategies suitable to implement at the workplace are healthy lifestyle programs designed to modify behaviors that impact the three most potent risk factors for CVD (i.e., smoking, blood cholesterol levels, and blood pressure) (Stamler et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001955">1999</CitationRef>). As with all behavioral modification programs that are consistent with the theoretical framework previously discussed, the most important components of any prevention strategies are to remove the optimistic bias that serves as a barrier to lifestyle changes, and engaging the individual through the stages of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Precontemplation/Contemplation</Emphasis> through the stages of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Action</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Maintenance</Emphasis>.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">As discussed in the previous section, programs that promote the prevention and cessation of ­smoking have a multiplier effect across several disease states, with CVD being one of the major ­preventable diseases linked to smoking. The methods previously discussed for smoking apply here as well. Although cholesterol and blood pressure levels constitute physiological risk factors for CVD, they can be indirectly impacted by behavioral factors and lifestyle choices. Promoting healthy lifestyle choices on appropriate nutrition, balanced diet, maintaining optimal weight, managing stress, and engaging in physical activity and exercise are optimal strategies that can be incorporated into the workplace setting. These can be promoted through informational media about risk factors and benefits of healthy lifestyle (e.g., brochures), but also through workplace activity programs and interest groups incorporating ­physical and/or relaxation activities (Marcus et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001935">1998</CitationRef>; Plotnikoff et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001946">2005</CitationRef>). Promoting routine screening for cholesterol, blood pressure, and stress-related mental health should also be encouraged as part of the overall workplace healthy lifestyle program, so that early signs of CVD (e.g., high cholesterol or blood pressure) and psychosocial risk factors (unmanaged stress) can be addressed and treated before progressing to later stages of CVD. For more detailed resources on designing such workplace ­programs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide useful toolkits and suggested programs suitable for enhancing physical activity and promoting healthy lifestyles in the workplace as part of the Healthier Worksite Initiative (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001914">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Section2 ID="Sec001917">
                <Heading>Prevention Strategies for Cancer</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Cancer has been addressed in another chapter of this handbook. The overall incidence and death rates from cancers have significantly declined in the United States, specifically from between 1990 and 2003 (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) (p. 251). However, certain types of cancers have seen an increase in incidence and mortality over the last decade and account for approximately 13% of cancer cases and related deaths in the United States (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) (p. 254). These include non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, liver cancer, melanoma, cancer of the esophagus, leukemia, and cancers of the soft connective tissue, thyroid, small intestine, and vulva (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) (p. 254). Despite lower incidence rates, cancer, like other diseases and illness, has a negative impact on the worker’s health, causes lost time from work due to illness, may cause worker mortality, and negatively impacts workplace productivity. Similarly to CVD, cancers are also linked to risk factors that are both within and beyond the control of the individual and the workplace. Risk factors beyond an individual’s control include family history, genetics, ethnic background, and age. However, certain risk factors are within the control of the workplace and the individual worker and include environmental factors at the ­workplace and behavioral factors. Therefore, prevention strategies targeting these latter two risk factors are suitable to be implemented as part of the overall workplace wellness and health promotion strategies.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Primary prevention strategies against cancer in the workplace should target both environmental factors of the occupational setting, as well as modifiable behavioral factors for the individual worker. Depending on the type of occupational setting and nature of the work, environmental risk factors may include exposure to asbestos, pesticides, carbon-based fumes from exhausts and motors, pesticides, carcinogenic chemicals, and radiation (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) (pp. 256–257). Detailed safety guidelines and mandatory protection equipment must be a part of the primary prevention strategy. As similarly described in the previous section on workplace injuries, comprehensive training programs should be part of the primary prevention strategy, and compliance with safety protocols should be monitored, with adequate and timely feedback provided for any deviations towards unsafe practices. Detailed procedures for how to report and respond to any exposure to carcinogenic environmental risk factors must be part of the workplace primary prevention procedures.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The major behavioral risk factors with moderate to strong evidence for causing cancer include smoking, diet and nutrition, sedentary lifestyle, excessive consumption of alcohol, and exposure to ultraviolet light. Promoting healthy lifestyle choices, such as smoking cessation, a balanced diet, and physical activity, has a multiplier effect across health states, including cancer. Therefore, the same strategies described in the previous section on CVD apply to primary prevention of cancer as well. Although there is mixed evidence for the causal link between excessive alcohol consumption and cancer (Singletary &amp; Gapstur, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001953">2001</CitationRef>), it is worth noting that the combination of alcohol consumption and smoking greatly increases the risk for developing some types of cancers, in some cases by up to 50% (Flanders &amp; Rothman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001919">1982</CitationRef>; Garavello et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001923">2005</CitationRef>). Therefore, educational material advising against excessive consumption of alcohol, along with its associated risks for increasing susceptibility to cancer, should be incorporated as part of any materials or programs for smoking prevention or cessation. Similarly, information and educational material should be provided on the risk of excessive exposure to ultraviolet light, and the steps one can take to mitigate such exposure through the use of adequate clothing as well as sun-block products (Moyal &amp; Fourtanier, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001939">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Secondary prevention for cancer involves helping the patient navigate through the complexity of the diagnosis, treatment, outcome of treatment, and potentially living with cancer. Secondary prevention strategies suitable for the workplace may include two important components for helping an individual worker with cancer cope with his/her present health state. First, it is crucial that cancer patients be provided adequate social support to cope with their condition. While this may not be under the purview of the workplace, it will be beneficial to provide general information about cancer patient and cancer survivor support groups, and how to get in touch with such groups or organizations. Second, it will be beneficial to provide access to stress-reduction and management strategies within the overall workplace health promotion program. The effect of stress-management psychosocial interventions show some evidence for obtaining successful outcomes among cancer patients that, in turn, improve immune function. These include improved mood, increase in perceived social support, and adoption of healthy behaviors such as cessation of smoking and adopting a healthy diet (Andersen et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00196">2004</CitationRef>). In addition, poorer psychosocial states, especially depression, is linked to progression of the cancer as well as mortality (Spiegel &amp; Giese-Davis, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001954">2003</CitationRef>). This underscores the importance of providing an organizational-level program for stress-reduction and management, not only for cancer, but in terms of its benefits as a multiplier effect for other diseases and illnesses ­discussed in the previous sections.</Para>

                <Heading>Prevention Strategies for Mental Health Disorders</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Again, the topic of mental health issues has been addressed in another chapter of this handbook. Indeed, stress in the workplace, and its resulting psychological toll, has a significant impact on workers’ well-being and the productivity of the organization. In a 2009 survey conducted by the American Psychological Association, 69% of employees report that work is a significant source of stress, 41% report that they feel tense during the workday, and 51% report being less productive at work as a result of stress (American Psychological Association, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00195">2009</CitationRef>). Mood disorders, a frequent result of unmanaged stress, are estimated to result in 321 million lost days annually, at a cost of $50 billion in productivity losses (Kessler et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001930">2006</CitationRef>). Although stress has been identified as a risk factor for some of the illnesses discussed above, it also has its own unique effect on well-being in the workplace, as well as an underlying cause for psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety (Brannon &amp; Feist, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001911">2007</CitationRef>) (pp. 152–155). Other associated mental health and psychosocial comorbidities associated with unmanaged stress in the workplace include interpersonal strain in family relationships, workplace violence, and substance abuse disorders (Gabriel &amp; International Labour Office, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001922">2000</CitationRef>). Therefore, prevention strategies targeting mental health would also contribute a multiplier effect towards prevention of risk factors for the onset and progression of other illnesses.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The most basic primary prevention strategy makes available educational information about stress-management and coping, with resources to community providers for counseling services. However, with increasing recognition of the impact of stress in the workplace and its link to associated illnesses, many employers now provide a more comprehensive bundle of services as part of the organizational healthy lifestyle promotion programs. These services include both facets of primary and secondary prevention strategies. Some examples of effective primary prevention, in addition to information and educational material, include lunchtime talks by professional counselors on stress-management techniques, as well as strategies for maintaining a healthy work-life balance (Gabriel &amp; International Labour Office, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001922">2000</CitationRef>). Broader scope of services that incorporate secondary prevention strategies are now also commonplace as part of the organizational healthy lifestyle promotion programs. Some examples have been reported in a survey conducted by the United States Bureau of National Affairs over the last decade. For example, in partnership with managed care organizations, more than 90% of 120 employers surveyed have expanded the scope of preventive mental health programs that included counseling on alcohol and substance abuse, mental health counseling, and family and marital counseling (Gabriel &amp; International Labour Office, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001922">2000</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">However, it should be noted that, when mental health services are provided as part of an overall healthy lifestyles program that incorporates a biopsychosocial approach to preventing onset of diseases and their progression into illnesses, the multiplier effect will be broad and benefits both employees as well as the employer. In a survey on the effectiveness and usefulness of workplace health programs, an overwhelming 85% of employees who participated in such programs endorsed them for being effective in promoting good health (Towers Perrin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001957">2008</CitationRef>). The beneficial impact for employers and workplace productivity were also similarly pronounced, as reported in a systematic review of 56 journal articles on worksite health promotion programs. That study reported the following: an average 26.8% reduction in sick leave absenteeism, 26.1% reduction in healthcare costs. 32% reduction in workers’ compensation and disability management claims costs. and an average $5.81 in savings for every dollar invested in workplace health promotion programs (Chapman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001915">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>

            <Section1 ID="Sec001919">
              <Heading>Conclusions and Future Directions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Primary and secondary prevention programs should be an essential component of the occupational setting. As discussed above, prevention strategies targeting even a few of the more common risk factors or lifestyle behaviors will provide a multiplier effect that promotes prevention of multiple other diseases. In addition to maintaining a healthy workforce, there is documented evidence on the benefits reaped by employers when such programs are well-designed and implemented as part of organizational policy. The United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OHSA) recent report on the effectiveness of mandatory prevention programs in several States estimate that ­occupational injuries and illness can be reduced by between 15 and 35% when implemented, translating to a cost-savings of between $9 billion to $23 billion annually in direct healthcare costs alone (Occupational Health and Safety Administration, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001944">2012</CitationRef>). Further accounting of indirect costs, such as lost productivity, retraining of temporary or replacement employees, and the potential increase in workers compensation premiums, would yield an even more substantial amount. Additionally, a 2010 report published by the human resources consulting firm, Towers Watson, noted that companies with the most effective health and productivity programs achieved 11% more revenue per employee, delivered 28% higher shareholder returns and had lower medical trends and fewer absences per employee (Towers Watson <CitationRef CitationID="CR001958">2010</CitationRef>) (p. 2).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">According to the OSHA, all States have made some level of effort in promoting injury and illness prevention programs among the employers within their jurisdiction. These include 35 States that have laws and regulations covering prevention programs (mandatory in 15 of these States), while the remaining States promote prevention programs through financial incentives for employers, for example, through discounts on workers’ compensation premiums (Occupational Health and Safety Administration, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001944">2012</CitationRef>). It should be noted, that such laws and regulations do not necessarily cover all employers in all cases; in some States, the focus may only be on employers who are classified as “hazardous” due to the nature of the business and its associated occupational risks. Ideally, some level of prevention program should be a part of every organization, even if it only means low-cost primary prevention strategies. Future directions in the fields of occupational health and preventive medicine should more aggressively promote the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of prevention programs to small businesses (&lt;50 employees), who often lack prevention programs due to cost-restrictions on providing healthcare benefits, maintaining medical and disability committees, and designing and implementing large-scale programs. Oftentimes, all it would take is to guide the employers to the available resources that would help them achieve the goal of implementing prevention programs in the workplace. For example, the United Nations’ International Labour Office provides recommendations for implementing low-cost prevention programs at small businesses (&lt;50 employees), including partnering with community resources such as State and local rehabilitation agencies and support groups that impose little-to-none in terms of financial burden to the organization (Gabriel &amp; International Labour Office, <CitationRef CitationID="CR001922">2000</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">With increased penetration of broadband internet service nationwide, it is also possible to leverage new technologies and applied clinical solutions to meet occupational health needs, especially among small businesses in rural and underserved areas. One such example is the University of New Mexico’s Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes), that utilizes low-cost, telemedicine-based provider-to-provider consultation designed to bridge the gap between primary care providers in rural or underserved regions with medical specialists who may not be available in that particular rural area (Arora et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00198">2011a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00199">2011b</CitationRef>). Although initially developed to provide specialty consultation for chronic medical conditions, this low-cost model of service delivery may also be adapted for delivery of secondary prevention to the community provider who manages the disease or illness of the affected employee. Such a model of care can also be combined with Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy interventions to increase self-efficacy and enhance existing coping skills for the affected employee (Ruward et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001950">2009</CitationRef>; Grover et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR001925">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In conclusion, employers should incorporate comprehensive primary and secondary prevention programs as part of their overall organizational mission. Efforts to plan and implement such programs are today much easier, given the wealth of existing material in the medical and occupational health literature as well as the resources and recommendations provided by large organizations, State and local governments, academia, managed care organizations, insurers, and unions. Furthermore, the rapid development of new technologies should provide low-cost applied clinical solutions that can alleviate some employers’ fears on the cost-prohibitions of implementing comprehensive prevention programs. No doubt, the evidence shows that a healthy workforce translates into a more productive organization, and mutual benefit is accorded to both the employee and the employer when there is organizational investment in well-designed disease prevention and health promotion programs.</Para>
