          <Para TextBreak="No">This chapter focuses on the social production of health (SPH) with particular reference to Marxist analysis or political economy of health, fundamental cause theory and feminist analysis of health. Social production of health/disease refers to theoretical frameworks which argue that the structural inherent characters of human society, especially social and economic conditions, are fundamental causes of health inequalities. After examining the basic features of Marxism, this chapter proceeds with the discussion of the political economy of health (PEH), which is a macroanalytic, critical, and historical perspective for analysing disease distribution and health services under a variety of economic systems. This chapter traces the history of the Marxist analysis of health from classical ideas to recent proponents like Navarro Vicente, Hans A. Baer, and Howard Waitzkin. After some criticisms of PEH, the fundamental cause theory developed by Bruce G. Link and Jo C. Phelan (Journal of Health and Social Behavior (extra issue), 80–94, 1995) is presented. A fundamental cause theory tends to identify a factor that has persisted, fundamental or central despite changing circumstances, which can explain distribution of disease among groups in the society. Then, the feminist analysis of health, a form of dialectic (materialism) based on sex, which affects population health, is presented. The arguments start with reference to the classical ideas from <Emphasis Type="Italic">Sexual</Emphasis> Politics by Kate Millett, <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Second Sex</Emphasis> by Simone de Beauvoir, <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Dialectic of Sex</Emphasis> by Shulamith Firestone, and <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Sociology of Housework</Emphasis> by Ann Oakley. The chapter discusses the recent discourse on the feminist analysis of health in sociology with reference to the groundbreaking works of the 1970s and 1980s. The chapter also provides a theoretical explanation of engendered circumstances and experiences that affect women’s health.</Para>

The two theoretical analyses flow from the notion of social inequality in the society system. They have been part of the dominant conceptual analysis of health in recent times. Like functionalism, Marxist and feminist perspectives are also realist and positivist traditions. While there are many versions of feminism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Feminism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, a majority stem from these traditions.

          <Heading>Marxist or Conflict Perspective: A General Overview</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In sociology, Marxist theory (often called conflict theory) is a major perspective. It is traced back to the works of Karl Marx, Vilfredo Pareto, Georg Simmel, Lewis Coser, Randal Collins, C. Wright Mills, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Immanuel Wallerstein, among others. In the field of medical sociology, this perspective is more prominent in the works of Vicente Navarro, Hans A. Baer, and Howard Waitzkin, among others. The perspective derived its other name, Marxism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Marxism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, from Karl Marx, who devoted most of his works to the elaboration of conflict and its implications for societal arrangements. In terms of features, conflict perspective is a direct opposite of functionalism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Functionalism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">6.1</InternalRef> shows some basic views from the conflict perspective<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Conflict</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. While functionalism recognises the existence of cooperation and consensus in human society, Marxists argue that conflict is inherent in social life. Marx observed that the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle. This indicates that there are various groups in human society based on social inequality. There is also tension between these groups. Basically, there are bourgeoisie<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Bourgeoisie</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> (those who occupy the upper class) and proletariat<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Proletariat</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> (consisting of those in the lower class of the society). A class refers to a group of people who share similar relations with the means of production. In other words, Gabe et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2004</CitationRef>, p. 3)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Gabe, J.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> defined a social class as a segment of the population distinguished from others by similarities in labour market position and property relations. The bourgeoisie are the owners, employers, or the rich; and proletariats are the non-owners, employees, and the poor.</Para>

The perspective has some inherent features, such as dialectical and historical analysis. A more comprehensive definition therefore relates that PEH is “a macroanalytic, critical, and historical perspective for analyzing disease distribution and health services under a variety of economic systems, with particular emphasis on the effects of stratified social, political, and economic relations within the world economic system” (Morgan <CitationRef CitationID="CR40">1987</CitationRef>, p. 132)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

All of these actions and conditions happen as a result of societal injustice against a segment of the population and have adverse consequences for population health. More importantly, Engels observed that the mortality rate is based on class difference, as there was a higher mortality rate in the poor quarters.

The basic argument is that access to health care and the population health are determined by the level of socioeconomic development. Engels was able to prove this assertion in England from various data in 1844, with a conclusion that the health indicators of the working class were worse off.

Thus the proletarians work in hazardous conditions that are injurious to their health. The worker might not have the minimum standard of care in their work environment.

The same explanations are repeated on divergent issues such as distribution of illness, access, risk factors, health policies, and so forth.

The fundamental cause theory is interested in how certain social conditions form essential explanations for health inequalities. The theory is largely credited to Bruce G.

These studies by House et al. exalted the significance of SES as a cause of morbidity and mortality, and this invariable led to the idea of irreducible fundamental nature of social conditions (especially SES) in the theory of Link and Phelan (<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">1995</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">2010</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Later, feminism became a philosophical and theoretical perspective in the analysis of human society.

            </IndexTerm> is grounded on the tenet that women are illegitimately oppressed or disadvantaged by comparison to men. There are many versions of these interpretations of feminist-grounded tenet. There are liberal, radical, and socialist feminisms, among others. In fact, Chafetz (<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">1997</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm> observed that there is little consensus among feminist sociologists about the basic theoretical questions because of the proliferation of so many versions of feminism. Here, feminism is presented from a structuralist tradition. While there could be a measure of common belief in structural feminism, its arguments and solutions are often divergent. The liberal ones are analytical and the radical are so critical. Irrespective of the different versions, the common distinct feature is the presentation of gender as a ubiquitous and fundamental feature of social life<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Most of the literature that emerged shows the persistence of women’s poor health relative to men; the acquisition of differential risks due to social roles, lifestyles, and health behaviours between the sexes; and that women’s higher morbidity is firmly rooted in engendered circumstances and experiences (Verbrugge <CitationRef CitationID="CR66">1985</CitationRef>; Annandale and Hunt <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">1990</CitationRef>; Annandale <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2013</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm> described as inequalities inherent in the social definitions of femaleness and maleness. Such a consideration forms the lived experiences of both men and women. It is often argued that nobody is born a woman, but a person becomes one as a member of the society (Beauvoir <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">1972</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Due to feminist advocacy, there is a gradually changing role of women in human societies. Traditional boundaries and differentiation of roles have long been broken in many societies in work, sexuality<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Sexuality</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, leisure, family, parenthood, and so on. However, the gender gap is still a reality in many human societies, especially in the developing world<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
