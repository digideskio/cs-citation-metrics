              <Para>Adjoint sensitivity analysis of numerical models provides a platform for directly linking public health effects with air quality for evaluating emission control policies in a more straightforward manner. We link epidemiological and valuation statistics to the adjoint of CMAQ and calculate sensitivities of short-term mortality-related benefits in Canada, the U.S. and Europe to anthropogenic NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> and VOC emissions across two continental domains. Our results show significant spatial variability in impacts of NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> and VOC emissions reduction on short-term mortality. We estimate that sensitivities of mortality-related benefits to 10 % NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions reductions in major cities reach monetary values in excess of $635K/day in Europe and $355K/day in North America. We find that when the cumulative effects of anthropogenic emissions on O<Subscript>3</Subscript> and NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> population exposure are considered, NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions reductions generally yield higher mortality-related benefits than the same relative reductions in VOC emissions.</Para>

              <Para>Air pollution decision making becomes more straightforward when public health impacts (e.g. mortality, morbidity) are directly linked to emission sources. Currently, regulatory frameworks use air quality models in a forward or source-oriented manner, where the effectiveness of an emission control strategy is evaluated by projecting a change in emissions forward in time to estimate impacts (e.g. health effects) across all receptors. This type of approach is often scenario-based and unsuitable for estimating the marginal contributions of individual sources towards health benefits or costs as a whole (i.e. source specificity). Adjoint (backward) sensitivity analysis is a complementary approach that allows for calculation of spatiotemporal <Emphasis Type="Italic">contributions</Emphasis> of emission sources (or their reduction) to concentration-based health metrics. In this work, we conduct adjoint sensitivity analysis to estimate the response of national mortality (in terms of a monetary value or “benefit”) to anthropogenic NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> and VOC emissions at each location across Canada, the U.S., and Europe using the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model adjoint (CMAQ-adjoint).</Para>

              <Heading>Methodology</Heading>
              <Para>We define our sensitivity metrics, or adjoint cost functions, as the monetary value of the national mortality count for (1) Canada, (2) the U.S. and (3) Europe. Here, we look strictly at gas-phase pollutants correlated with short-term mortality. Mortality calculations for Canada and Europe are performed on the basis that both ozone (O<Subscript>3</Subscript>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<Subscript>2</Subscript>) have been correlated with short-term mortality in Canadian and/or European epidemiological studies. In the U.S., epidemiological evidence suggests a strong correlation between short-term mortality and O<Subscript>3</Subscript>, but not NO<Subscript>2</Subscript>. In all cases, we define the cost function using a Taylor series expansion to the exponential epidemiological functions describing the response of mortality to changes in pollutant concentrations (Eq. <InternalRef RefID="Equ00071">7.1</InternalRef>). <Equation ID="Equ00071">

              </Para>
              <Para>Here, ΔM is the change in mortality count (relative to a baseline), M<Subscript>0</Subscript> is the all-age, non-accidental baseline mortality rate (#/population-year), P is the population, β is the pollutant-specific coefficient derived from relevant epidemiological studies, and ΔC is the change in pollutant concentration for a specified averaging period.</Para>
              <Para>This is a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate applicability of the adjoint method in source attribution of health outcomes. Therefore, we use similar β-values of 8.39 × 10<Superscript>−4</Superscript> ppb<Superscript>−1</Superscript> for daily 1-h maximum O<Subscript>3</Subscript> and 7.48 × 10<Superscript>−4</Superscript> ppb<Superscript>−1</Superscript> for 24-h average NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00072">2</CitationRef>] for Canada and Europe despite the wide range of epidemiological findings for these domains. For the U.S., we use a β-value of 3.9 × 10<Superscript>−4</Superscript> for daily 1-h maximum O<Subscript>3</Subscript> [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00073">3</CitationRef>]. Finally, we monetize the mortality counts using the value of a statistical life (VSL) for different regions/countries ($5.7M, 2011 PPP for Canada from Health Canada’s Air Quality Benefits Assessment Tool; $8.1M, 2011 PPP for the US from the U.S. EPA, and $2.8M, 2011 PPP for Europe from Bell et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00071">1</CitationRef>]).</Para>
              <Para>Using CMAQ-adjoint, we calculate the derivatives of national mortality valuation due to exposure to O<Subscript>3</Subscript> (and NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> for Canada and Europe) with respect to emissions of each model species, and average over the modeling period. Our preliminary simulations for Canada and the U.S. are conducted for August 2007, while our European simulation is conducted for a 2-week period from June 15–30, 2009. We calculate sensitivities at horizontal resolutions of 36 and 27 km for the North American and European domains, respectively.</Para>

              <Para>Local and long-range influences of NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions on national mortality are evident in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00071">7.1</InternalRef>a–c, while VOC emission influences have a tendency to be more localized. Domestic emission patterns are strong drivers of mortality-related costs or benefits (depending on perspective) as a result of demographic trends and regions of concentrated anthropogenic activity.</Para>
              <Para>In Canada, a significant portion of the benefits come from highly populous areas of south-eastern Ontario/Quebec (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00071">7.1</InternalRef>a). The sensitivities of mortality to NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions in these regions reach peak values of $300K/day (upwind of Toronto, Ontario). That is, if NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions in that grid cell within the Toronto region were reduced by 10 %, Canada (not necessarily Toronto) would expect to benefit by that daily amount from reduced exposure to O<Subscript>3</Subscript> and NO<Subscript>2</Subscript>. Sensitivities for Canada are positive across the domain due to the inclusion of NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> in the cost function. Where O<Subscript>3</Subscript> shows a negative sensitivity to NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions, larger, positive sensitivities related to NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> exposure contribute to an overall benefit. Influences coming from locations in the north-eastern U.S. and the western provinces (sensitivities upwards of $65K/day for NO<Subscript>x</Subscript>) are also notable in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00071">7.1</InternalRef>a. These locations of high influence correspond to areas of high NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions and/or populous Canadian areas. VOC emissions have significantly lower influences on mortality, with the largest benefit seen around Vancouver, British Columbia, with a gradient of $45K/day for a 10 % reduction.</Para>
              <Para>Contributions of North American NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> and VOC emissions towards short-term mortality in the U.S. are significantly higher in magnitude as compared to Canada (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00071">7.1</InternalRef>b) due to larger populations and emissions in the U.S. Sensitivities of short-term mortality to NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions (from O<Subscript>3</Subscript> exposure only) reach upwards of $355K/day (Atlanta, Georgia). A few locations show negative sensitivities to NO<Subscript>x</Subscript>, such as Los Angeles, California, whose sensitivity is -$255K/day for that same 10 % reduction in emissions. In other words, reducing emissions in this particular location would increase national exposure to daily 1-h maximum O<Subscript>3</Subscript> in the U.S. In Los Angeles, there is a significant, positive sensitivity to VOC emissions reduction ($575K/day), indicating the highly NO<Subscript>x</Subscript>-inhibited/VOC-limited regime in this metropolitan environment.</Para>
              <Para>Our preliminary results for Europe show sensitivities that are considerably larger than those for North American NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions reduction, but comparable for VOCs (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00071">7.1</InternalRef>c). Overall, higher population densities generally lead to larger influences over the European domain. Similar to Canada, inclusion of NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> in the exposure-based sensitivity metric results in widespread positive sensitivities (benefits) with respect to NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions reduction (with the exception of the U.K.). The largest benefits are attributed to emissions in Barcelona, Spain, whose sensitivities are $635K/day for NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> and $155K/day for anthropogenic VOCs. Significant contributions are also seen from the Southern Mediterranean shipping routes.</Para>
              <Para>In contrast to the North American domain, spatial heterogeneities observed in European contributions do not simply follow population centres and have a more regional structure (such as areas of influence over Germany and France). Due to complexities over the European domain, delineating regional trends may require longer and higher resolution adjoint simulations.</Para>

              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q:</Emphasis> Would including PM (or its components) in your results change your costs? Would it, in your opinion, eliminate the negative costs per vehicle? If no, would it then be advised to encourage people to drive more?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A:</Emphasis> Firstly, our analysis only considers gas-phase pollutant exposure as the adjoint to CMAQ for PM is still under development. Including PM would indeed affect the health benefit sensitivities and hence the transportation cost estimates we calculate. In some cities, dis-benefits (or negative sensitivities) associated with NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions reduction would be outweighed by the beneficial impacts of reduced national exposure to secondary PM. However, in strongly NO<Subscript>x</Subscript>-inhibited urban environments where substantial negative sensitivities exist, we expect that the negative costs per vehicle removed might still exist. Reduced mobile emissions of NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> usually accompany reduction in co-pollutants such as primary PM, so the overall benefit in a multi-pollutant analysis is likely to be positive.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>The results of this work do not necessarily suggest that people should be encouraged to drive in locations that show negative sensitivities. Long-term air quality planning would incorporate a combination of local and particularly regional emission controls (e.g. power plants) that would cause urban environments to become less and less NO<Subscript>x</Subscript>-inhibited. Therefore, these dis-benefits are likely to become smaller as more progressive controls take effect.</SimplePara>

              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q:</Emphasis> Do you think your results will change by picking different episode lengths?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A:</Emphasis> We have noticed that the temporally-averaged benefit sensitivities do change over various simulation periods due to a strong dependency on meteorology. For long-term air quality planning, it is advised to perform adjoint sensitivity analysis over more than just a single season of 1 year to capture intra-season and intra-annual variability.</SimplePara>
