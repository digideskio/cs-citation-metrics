            <Heading>The History</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par2" TextBreak="No">The history of female surgeons dates back as far as 3500 Before Common Era (BCE). Entombed with the Sumerian queen Shubad of Ur were surgical instruments made of flint and bronze, which have led archaeologists to believe she practiced as an early surgeon [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. The Queen is not alone; documentation of female surgeons exists in many ancient civilizations. In fact, the abundance of ancient records and artistic depictions of women practicing surgery suggest that female surgeons were relatively commonplace in ancient times. Egyptian records show that there were female students at the medical school of Heliopolis in Egypt as early as 1500 BCE, and detailed portrayals of female surgeons are common on the walls of Egyptian temples and tombs. A small painting of a slave girl operating on a patient has been discovered in a small chapel in Thebes (circa 1420 BCE). The Bible, Talmud, and other Jewish writings provide accounts of Jewish women trained as surgeons, and when the Romans conquered the Greek city-state of Corinth, hundreds of female prisoners were taken to Rome for the slave markets, where women with medical training sold for the highest price [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par3" TextBreak="No">One particularly impressive female surgeon of antiquity was <Emphasis Type="Bold">Aspasia</Emphasis>, a Greek gynecologist (circa fourth century CE). Aspasia’s innovative surgical techniques were compiled by eminent Byzantine physician and medical writer Aeitus in his work the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Tetrabiblion</Emphasis> (fifth century CE), which served as the main surgical text for the next 600 years [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Aspasia developed and performed a variety of surgical operations. Her operation for uterine fibroids was an early form of fibroid surgical excision that was still used in modern times. She also developed a procedure for varicoceles that was – in effect – an open subinguinal varicelectomy, fairly similar to today’s methods. Aspasia’s surgical treatment of hydrocele closely resembles the modern hydrocelectomy, a surgical option still in use today [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par4" TextBreak="No">The formal medical education of women was banned during the Middle Ages, after the fall of the Roman Empire and the rise of the male-dominated Catholic Church. Medical science itself was in a general decline, and most medical care was performed in monasteries. The medical care of the time placed a heavy emphasis on prayer and holy relics, and physical treatments for disease gradually fell out of favor. By the twelfth century, the church had officially banned monks from performing operations. Surgery became the responsibility of tradesmen trained as barbers, and women were generally prevented from practicing surgical procedures unless they inherited the practice from a deceased husband. In the fourteenth century, King Henry VIII decreed “No carpenter, smith, weaver, or woman shall practice surgery” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. By the seventeenth century, medicine had become more scientific, but women were still barred from the profession as few women at the time received a formal education [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par5" TextBreak="No">Women in surgery have enjoyed a gradual resurgence in modern times, although they were not always allowed to practice openly. A physician by the name of <Emphasis Type="Bold">Dr. James Barry</Emphasis> graduated from the prestigious Edinburgh Medical School in 1812 at the age of 17 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. After graduation, he joined the British army and served as a surgeon during the Napoleonic wars. Referred to by the moniker “the beardless lad,” Dr. Barry led an illustrious career in the British armed forces. He led public health reform measures in Africa and the West Indies, and is credited with performing the first successful cesarean section in Africa. Over the course of his career, he rose to the rank of Inspector General in charge of military hospitals [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. During his career there were rumors Dr. Barry was involved in a long term romantic relationship with another man. Upon “his” death, Dr. Barry was revealed to be woman with abdominal findings consistent with a history of pregnancy. After Dr. Barry’s death, a friend commented Dr. Barry “chose to be a military doctor not to fight for the right of a woman to become one, but simply to be one.” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]</Para>
            <Para ID="Par6" TextBreak="No">Although male practitioners in colonial America refused to take on female apprentices, women practicing as “doctresses” practiced both medicine and surgery in rural towns prior to the formal establishment of medical schools. The first medical schools established in America refused to admit female students, but by the mid-1800s women began to return to medicine. The first woman to graduate from medical school in the United States was <Emphasis Type="Bold">Elizabeth Blackwell, MD</Emphasis>. Her initial attempts at gaining admission to medical school were plagued with rejection, and she was denied admission by more than 20 medical schools [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Male physicians acquainted with Blackwell and her talents repeatedly advised her to dress as a man, insisting she would be accepted to medical school if not for her gender [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. Believing women should have the right to openly practice medicine, Blackwell refused to assume a male identity and persisted in her admissions efforts, eventually earning admission to the small Geneva Medical College in New York and graduating in 1849. Dr. Blackwell’s sister, Emily Blackwell followed in her older sister’s footsteps and became the third woman to graduate from an American medical school [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. The Blackwell sisters were forced to move to Europe for advanced clinical training, as women at the time were unable to obtain clinical experience in the United States [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. Although it was Elizabeth Blackwell’s ambition to become a surgeon, the loss of her right eye to infection effectively ended her surgical ambitions, and she instead returned to the United States where she would eventually open her own hospital and found America’s first medical school for women [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par7" TextBreak="No">
              <Emphasis Type="Bold">Mary Edwards Walker, MD</Emphasis>, was the second woman to graduate from medical school, and the first recognized female surgeon in the United States [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Dr. Walker entered into surgical practice with her husband and former classmate, Albert Miller. Their practice was ultimately unsuccessful, and it has been speculated that Dr. Walker’s decision to keep her maiden name and openly practice as a female surgeon contributed to the demise of the couple’s practice [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Dr. Walker practiced as a nurse for several years, before enlisting in the military in 1863, where she became the first female surgeon in the United States army [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. Dr. Walker served in the civil war, and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for her military service. Though the medal was revoked in 1917 – as she had not served on the front lines in battle – it was restored by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. To this day she remains the only female recipient of the Medal of Honor.</Para>

            <Heading>At Present</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par8" TextBreak="No">Women have made serious advances in the fields of medicine and surgery in the recent past, but 160 years after Elizabeth Blackwell’s graduation from medical school, society is still far from gender parity. Although women now constitute roughly 50 % of American medical students and enter academic medicine as faculty in numbers equal to their male colleagues, women are grossly underrepresented in positions of power and leadership [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. As of 2011, only 19 % of tenured professors, 17 % of full professors, 12 % of department chairs, and 11 % of deans (A total of 14 deans) were female [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. If current trends continue, surgical residents will be equal proportions of men and women as early as the year 2028. The same trends, however, indicate that there will not be an equal number of male and female full professors of surgery until the year 2096 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par9" TextBreak="No">This leadership gap is not limited to medicine or surgery. It was long held that gender parity would be achieved as women entered the workforce in greater numbers. Referred to as the “pipeline effect,” it was believed that women had not been present in sufficient numbers in the professional workforce for long enough to have advanced to senior leadership [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. It was speculated that as more women entered the workforce they would move along the leadership pipeline, rise through the ranks and take a proportionate share of senior leadership roles. This has yet to happen, despite ample time. Although women have earned more than 50 % of college degrees since the early 1980s, and currently outnumber men in management and professional occupations [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>], women make up only 16 % of top executive positions in America’s largest corporations. Only 17 countries in the world (out of 195) are led by women [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. In the medical field, women are even underrepresented in leadership positions within the specialties dominated by women: for the past 25 years, 50 % or more of psychiatrists, gynecologists and pediatricians have been female, and yet women constitute only 20 % of full professors and 10 % of department chairs within these specialties [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. As Sheryl Sanberg wrote in <Emphasis Type="Italic">Lean In –</Emphasis> her Bestselling opus on female leadership – “The blunt truth is that men still rule the world” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par10" TextBreak="No">Even in a world run largely by men, surgery has long stood out as a particularly male dominated profession. The American College of Surgeons elected its first female chair to the board of regents in 2012, and no woman has ever served as the executive director. The American Surgical Association has only now (2015) elected a female president, and as of 2013 did not have any female council members. Of the eight regional surgical societies, three have never had a female president, and an additional four have had only one [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. Women in academic surgical departments are ten times more likely to perceive gender discrimination than their male colleagues [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]. One study of 105 medical students indicated that 96 % of female students viewed surgery as “unfavorable” to their gender [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. Although by 2011 more than a third of general surgery residents were female, only 14 % of full time faculty members were female [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]. Faculty attrition remains substantial, with female surgeons at the assistant professor level being almost six times more likely to report an interest in leaving academia than male colleagues [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par11" TextBreak="No">One study, conducted by Yedida and Bickel, conducted 80 min interviews with medical department chairs, and asked them to discuss the obstacles women face when rising through the ranks of academic medicine. The chairpersons identified three major barriers: traditional gender roles, sexism in the medical environment, and a lack of effective mentors [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>].</Para>
          </Section1>
          <Section1 ID="Sec3">
            <Heading>Gender Roles</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par12" TextBreak="No">Adherence to traditional gender roles plays a large part in inhibiting the career advancement of successful women. Sheryl Sandberg notes that “from the moment we are born, boys and girls are treated differently.” Studies have shown mothers will spend more time comforting and coddling female infants while male infants are left to play alone. Similarly, parents will overestimate the crawling ability of male children and underestimate the abilities of female children. In school, teachers interact more with boys and ask them more questions. Boys are more likely to call out answers whereas girls who speak out of turn are chided and reminded to raise their hands without speaking [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. Women are expected to be submissive, communal, and nurturing, whereas men are held to be strong, independent and action-oriented. These expectations have created a society that drives women towards careers that coincide with these expected traits, including childcare, nursing, and social work, while leaving fields like surgery and engineering dominated by men [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par13" TextBreak="No">The pressure to adhere to traditional gender roles is particularly problematic for female surgeons who aim to balance a career and family life. Women have traditionally been responsible for the majority of housework and childcare, and while male surgeons can often rely on their spouses to take on domestic duties that they are too busy to perform, women are rarely afforded that opportunity [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. Ninety percent of married female academic surgeons live in a dual career household, whereas only half of their male colleagues have a working spouse [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. Female academic surgeons without children earn roughly 95 % of the salary of comparatively matched male colleagues, while female academic surgeons with children earned only 75 % the salary of comparative males [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. Women are aware of this discrepancy, and are more likely to postpone having children until the completion of all surgical training than male colleagues (67 % against 37 %) to compensate [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. One female medical chair interviewed in the Yedida study asserted: “for many of us as women who got where we were, we got there by delaying our rewards. We got there by not getting married and/or having children while in college or in medical school or even residency” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. Female surgeons are far less likely than their male counterparts to marry at all; one survey of 317 academic general surgeons found that 1 in 4 female academic surgeons answered that they had never been married. The never-married rate among male colleagues was only 1 in 25 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par14" TextBreak="No">Furthermore, academic tenure tracks and senior leadership positions generally require incumbents to work inflexible hours and be willing to relocate geographically. As a result, young mothers who are responsible for the majority of childcare, or who temporarily switch to part time are often at a serious disadvantage. For example, meetings called during off hours often have a larger proportion of male attendees, which leads male faculty to be assigned more responsibilities. Unlike many men, women are often less willing or able to relocate their family, which limits opportunities for career advancement [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>].</Para>

            <Heading>Sexism</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par15" TextBreak="No">Sexism – whether conscious or unconscious – has been a major barrier to the success of women in the surgical field. Surgery has long been considered a “boy’s club,” and one survey of medical students found that 54 % of female students reported sexual harassment during their surgical rotation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. Sexism is not limited to overt sexual harassment; a perhaps equally detrimental form of sexism is gender discrimination. In one survey of board certified female surgeons, 70 % of respondents indicated that they had experienced gender discrimination. Of the surveyed women, 63 % described being bullied, 29 % were the object of sexist remarks or inappropriate advances, and 42 % reported the presence of sexism and discrimination against women as systematic within the male power structure [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. Gender discrimination is not always clearly intentional. A common complaint made by female professionals – that is by no means limited to the field of surgery – is that women have less access to the informal networking opportunities that are often necessary for career advancement. Women are rarely invited to social locations like racquetball courts, golf courses and locker rooms where important organizational information and negotiations take place [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. One study of the gender climate at an academic health center found that 24 % of female faculty members believed informal networking systematically excluded women [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>].</Para>

            <Heading>Mentorship</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par16" TextBreak="No">Mentors are crucial to career advancement, as they can provide professional advice, networking opportunities, contacts, and career advancement opportunities [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. As there are fewer women in surgical leadership positions, there are invariably fewer female mentors available. The Yedida et al survey of medical department chairs asserted that “A common theme relevant to progress in all of these spheres was the chairs’ belief that mentors play a crucial role in facilitating change and yet, in many cases, adequate role models are not sufficiently available for women” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. Female mentors can provide women with advice on how to overcome the specific challenges women face in surgery and surgical leadership, having already overcome said challenges themselves. Mentors can also help female faculty avoid taking on tasks more associated with staff than with leadership, and can give advice on how to balance their careers with their personal lives [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. Mentors are most often thought of as active participants in the development of their protégés, but mentors can be passive as well, unknowingly providing guidance by serving as a role model for younger faculty to follow [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Structured mentoring programs, where mentorships are assigned and official have been shown to be effective and improve faculty retention, as have peer mentoring programs [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. Both could serve as potential solutions to the lack of female mentors, or at least as a temporary solution until the number of female faculty available to serve as mentors increases.</Para>

            <Heading>A Personal Journey – Leading by Example – Julie Freischlag</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par17" TextBreak="No">My journey as a woman leader in surgery has been more reactive – especially at the beginning – than proactive. I have found in my role as a Division Chief and Department Chair and now as a Dean and Vice Chancellor, the majority of men who desire leadership positions have more of a thought-out plan of attack than do women with similar aspirations. Women tend to want to accomplish a great deal, but do not look at leadership as necessary to do that. They may also feel that leadership is not for them even though they have not explored the possibility adequately. I encourage everyone who I lead to consider being a leader- but I especially spend time encouraging women to do that as I think those words of advice could make a difference in their choices later on in their career.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par18" TextBreak="No">I remember my maternal grandfather telling me when I was 6 years old and had just skipped first grade – that people will tell me that I cannot do certain things – and that I will need to tell them I can. He was a coal miner with little education but somehow he knew that there would be obstacles in my way – especially people who did not feel that girls and boys were equally capable. He died the next year, probably ruptured an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Years later, as I found out that not everyone would encourage me, and that some would even try to hold me back, I remembered my grandfather’s words and was inspired to forge ahead.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par19" TextBreak="No">My mother was an elementary school teacher and she encouraged me and my two brothers to do well in school, and it was expected that we would attend college. She had gone to college for 2 years and back then that was all that was required to teach. She did take classes throughout my childhood to try and finish her degree, but was a course or 2 short. She was a substitute teacher and worked a lot and loved teaching. I wanted to be a teacher too, and initially went to college to become a high school biology teacher. However, the University of Illinois closed the education program because they thought they were training too many teachers, so I switched to premed.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par20" TextBreak="No">I was accepted early decision to Rush Medical School and my class was 42 % women with an average age of the class being 28 – both being unusual for the time. The reason behind that was Norma Wagoner, PhD, who was a professor of anatomy and the Dean of admissions. Dr. Wagoner looked for those students with unusual backgrounds – many having a previous career – and women. She was fabulous and was so supportive of all of us. I thought I wanted to be a pediatrician so I did my surgery clerkship first to get it out of the way and fell in love with surgery. My mentors then were Stephen Economou MD, an attending surgeon, and Tom Witt MD, a senior resident. They did not seem to notice that I was a female or perhaps it did not matter. Dr. Economou’s son Jim ended up in my intern class at UCLA and his daughter Stacey was in the year behind as an otolaryngology resident. Dr. Witt’s wife was a lawyer. I do think having professional women as daughters and wives have helped surgeons to understand how one should support and sponsor women in surgery.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par21" TextBreak="No">I was the 6th women to finish the general surgery program at UCLA and the second female vascular surgery fellow. Wesley Moore, MD, was the Division Chief at that time and supported me completely. Twelve years after I finished my vascular fellowship, I came back to take his role as Division Chief when he stepped down. I was only the 6th woman to pass her vascular surgery boards. Now there are almost 250 women with vascular surgery boards compared to almost 3,000 men. Less than 10 women have served as vascular surgery Division Chiefs. Presently, there are five in the country: Amy Reed at Penn State University, Linda Harris at University of Buffalo, Vivian Gahtan at University of Syracuse, Cynthia Shortell at Duke, and Omaida Velazquez at the University of Miami.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par22" TextBreak="No">George Sheldon, MD, told me that I should look at his Chair position at the University of North Carolina, as he was stepping down. That was the first time I ever thought about being a Department Chair. He told me that I had those leadership qualities. I had been Chief of Surgery at the Zablocki VA Medical Center in Milwaukee for 2 years prior to being the vascular surgery Division Chief at UCLA for 5 years. Jonathan Townes, MD, who was vascular surgery Division Chief at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, was a strong supporter for my pursuit of a Chair of Surgery position, as was Michael Zinner, MD, who had hired me as an Assistant Professor at UCLA when he was Chair of Surgery there.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par23" TextBreak="No">I looked at many chair positions: University of North Carolina, University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Southern Illinois University, University of Colorado, and finally Johns Hopkins. Applicants need to look at many of these jobs as the competition is tough and they are looking for a fit. The fit is important for your success and applicants should not get discouraged if they do not receive the nod. As it happened, Dean Edward Miller at Johns Hopkins had a vision to change the culture of surgery, and I was the one who was willing and able to do it. There have been a total of 11 Chairs of Surgery who are women. Olga Jonasson, MD, was the first at Ohio State University. Following Dr. Jonasson are: (1) Carol Scott-Connor at the University of Iowa; (2) Nancy Ascher at University of California at San Francisco; (3) Barbara Bass at Methodist Hospital in Houston; (4) Diana Farmer at University of California at Davis; (5) Mary McCarthy at Dayton University; (6) Carol Stromski at Michigan State; (7) Heidi Nelson at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester; (8) Anne Mosenthal at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School; (9) Leigh Neumayer at the University of Arizona; and (10) myself at Johns Hopkins. There are presently seven currently holding these positions (Ascher, Bass, Farmer, McCarthy, Nelson, Mosenthal, and Neumayer). I am hopeful that in the near future a few more women will be named as Chairs of Surgery across the country as there are a few positions open and a few women in contention as I write this. I spend time talking to these women and reviewing their vision and plans as well as sharing the story of my own successes. I submit their names to search committees and write letters on their behalf; one needs to be a mentor so that more women will lead.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par24" TextBreak="No">After 11 years as Chair of Surgery, I took the position of Vice Chancellor of Human Health Sciences and Dean of the School of Medicine at the University of California at Davis. Again, I looked at many Dean’s positions and was offered a few of them. But I was looking for “the fit;” I had changed the culture at Johns Hopkins in the Department of Surgery and I wanted a similar challenge. I had been asked starting in about my 3rd year as Chair to look at Dean positions. I looked at Michigan, Emory, San Antonio, Drexel, Kansas, Johns Hopkins, – I was offered 3 of them, made it to the top 3 in one of them, but did not make it through the first round in the others. Some others did not even interview me. Again – fit and tough competition.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par25" TextBreak="No">I decided to take the UC Davis due to the fit with the Chancellor (a woman electrical engineer) and Provost and the fact I had prior experience with the UC system. All of the UC hospitals and campuses work together and I thought I could learn a lot about population health and state wide health care. Janet Napolitano became President of the University of California system and I wanted to learn from her. My Department at Johns Hopkins was looking great; many were leading and seven faculty members had gone out to become Chairs of Surgery or leaders in research. It was time to get out of their way and let a new leader emerge or be brought in.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par26" TextBreak="No">There are only 15 women deans presently and only one other woman surgeon is a Dean. Toni Ganzel, a pediatric otolaryngologist, became Dean at Louisville the year before I took my position.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par27" TextBreak="No">My professional journey has been full of surprises. Every step of the way I have been in the company of exceptionally talented and accomplished colleagues and mentors; stars – both rising and established – who are true giants of the surgical field. These “giants” have inspired and helped me to see farther than I would have ever thought possible. It began with my parents who made me believe I could do anything I wanted, and the subtle influence of stories of a surgeon grandfather whom I never knew. My mother – a University of Wisconsin graduate – was a flight attendant in the 1950s and was required quit her job when she married. My father was a WWII naval fighter pilot who started medical school in Minnesota, but left when he became attracted to the then startup insurance company Blue Cross. I had a pretty typical Midwestern upbringing before my father decided he no longer wanted to raise “city kids” and moved us to Idaho.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par28" TextBreak="No">Medicine was my third attempt at a career. In high school I thought I wanted to be an opera singer. I won a few local vocal music awards, and had the opportunity to perform at Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy center, and La Madeleine in Paris. Realizing that being good at the high school level in Idaho might not translate into international stardom, my parents encouraged me to apply to a “real” college rather than Julliard. Opera was career attempt number 1. I enrolled at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where I majored in Marine Studies and Molecular biology. In 1976 Rhodes Scholarships were first made available to women. Wellesley, as a woman’s college, wanted a student of theirs to become one of the first female Rhodes Scholars, and I was encouraged to apply. At Oxford, I planned to study how to end hunger by feeding the world krill. It was not to be and a car accident derailed my interview for the Rhodes and also career attempt number 2 – Marine Biology.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par29" TextBreak="No">I became interested in medicine and medical decision making for patients while recuperating from my own injuries. I matriculated to the University of Washington School of Medicine and it was there I encountered a wise vascular surgeon, Kai Johansen, who encouraged me to accept a Luce Scholarship to study medicine in Asia, despite advice from others that only “family medicine and pediatric types” did that “overseas stuff” and that I would “never get into a serious field like surgery.” Emboldened by Dr. Johansen, I went to Singapore. Over the course of an amazing year, I worked in the Department of Surgery at the National University of Singapore, studied traditional Chinese medicine and became certified in acupuncture. This early international experience taught me that it was ok to break with convention, and would later become the springboard for my work in global surgery [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par30" TextBreak="No">Following my return, I came to know three leaders within the field of pediatric surgery, and these interactions would lay the fundamental foundation for my career as a surgeon-scientist. David Tapper – Surgeon in Chief of the Seattle Children’s Hospital – was the first of the three to give me guidance. He encouraged me to follow my interest in scientific research, which at the time was not the typical career trajectory for women or for surgeons. Dr. Tapper directed me to UCSF to work with the pediatric surgeons Alfred De Lorimier and Michael Harrison. Dr. Harrison directed me to the cancer immuno therapy lab where I worked for 2 years studying a field which can be viewed as the predecessor of modern stem cell therapy. Though I did not know it at the time, this work would set the course for my own research career. Serendipity strikes again.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par31" TextBreak="No">In my third year of research, I joined DuPont-Merck Pharmaceuticals in Delaware. I divided my time between continuing my research on cellular immunotherapy as a senior scientist conducting basic work on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and serving as the Assistant Medical Director of Cancer Clinical Trials. Although I gained invaluable experience running large-scale multi-center clinical trials, explored what a career in industry could look like, and even traveled to Italy to help establish technologies at a Sicilian cancer institute, if the truth be told, the primary reason I took that opportunity was to follow my husband who was doing his pediatric anesthesia and critical care fellowship at CHOP. Again, serendipity.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par32" TextBreak="No">At the end of my year at DuPont, I returned to UCSF to finish my general surgery residency. After residency, I was accepted into a pediatric surgery fellowship at the Children’s Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, and was also offered a position in UCSF’s cardiac surgery program. I found myself wavering between the two options. UCSF was the safer option; The Children’s Hospital Fellowship was an amazing opportunity, but would necessitate another cross-country move. Dr. Arvin Phillipart, Surgeon-in-Chief of the Childrens Hospital – ended up being the deciding factor. Instead of telling me to go or not to go, he simply said, “Do what is best for you. That’s it.”</Para>
            <Para ID="Par33" TextBreak="No">Dr. Phillipart was someone who respected my autonomy, and had <Emphasis Type="Bold">my</Emphasis> best interests as his priority. In the end, I accepted the fellowship.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par34" TextBreak="No">Finding the right mentors is important. Literature on mentorship shows that those who receive mentorship are promoted earlier, are more likely to follow their initial career goals, and experience greater fulfilment in their careers [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. Over the past decade, a variety of surgical journals – including the Journal of the American College of Surgeons, the American Journal of Surgery, the Archives of Surgery, and the Journal of Pediatric Surgery – have featured original articles, reviews and editorials that underscore the importance of mentoring for junior surgeons as they embark upon their careers [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>]. Your mentors can be senior surgeons or the Department chair. Your mentors can also be from different specialties or sub-specialties with complementary research interests [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. Whoever they are, your mentors should push you to push yourself within the context of <Emphasis Type="Italic">your</Emphasis> values and <Emphasis Type="Italic">your</Emphasis> aspirations for <Emphasis Type="Italic">your</Emphasis> life. The best mentors will not solve your problems for you; instead, they will encourage you to establish your own independence and learn by personal experience [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>]. Mentors can also play a key role in your professional development by connecting you to future collaborators, by prompting you to take career advancing opportunities, and by providing delicate advice on office politics [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par35" TextBreak="No">It is important to keep in mind that mentoring is not a one-way street, where you as a junior surgeon-scientist receive wisdom from a benevolent mentor. As a mentee, you bring your questions, your desires, and your drive to the table. You work with and sometimes for your mentor, benefitting from their knowledge and experience. You also pay them back with your insights, your feedback, and sometimes your time on their projects. The most successful surgical mentor-mentee relationships are very much reciprocal.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par36" TextBreak="No">At the Children’s Hospital of Michigan in Detroit, I benefited from the fact the Children’s Hospital of Michigan had become an unexpected epicenter for fetal intervention and research. Indeed, it was the first fetal treatment center outside of UCSF. At Michigan, I worked alongside Alan Flake, who had preceded me at UCSF and is now recognized as the father of <Emphasis Type="Italic">in utero</Emphasis> stem cell therapy. Detroit also marked the second time stem cell therapy crossed my path. Instead of treating cancer patients with cells, the surgeons were now treating children before birth with cells. I witnessed Flake perform the first <Emphasis Type="Italic">in utero</Emphasis> stem cell transplant for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).</Para>
            <Para ID="Par37" TextBreak="No">Overall, my time in Michigan helped me to understand that it is not prestige or location alone that predicate discovery. It is the people. Having the accumulation of the right people in the right place at the right time is the single most important factor in the mysterious alchemy of scientific discovery.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par38" TextBreak="No">As a faculty member back at UCSF, intimately involved in the early days of fetal surgery, I loved the research. However, I recognized and understood that our successes always came with a price. With great discovery comes great competition – for grants, for leadership on grants, for honors and awards, and for promotions. The most important advice I can give is to make comrades of your competitors, to be gracious when you win, try to find forgiveness when treated unfairly, and to thoughtfully choose when something is worth a fight. While I in no way perfectly navigated the choppy seas, I steered myself to a place where I could lead my own research, now focused on stem cell therapy for fetal surgical diseases.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par39" TextBreak="No">We all know that a surgeon-scientist career is simultaneously frustrating and compelling. It is about more than chance and more than planning. It is about persistence in the face of failure. It is about recognizing and creating opportunities. It is also about politics, about knowing how to deal with people and with the system. Over the course of my career, I have lost my early naiveté about the “pure” integrity of scientific research. Yet every time I have been discouraged or disheartened, I have found something new – some new research direction, some new employment opportunity, some new collaborator – that has re-invigorated me. Even when faced with brutal disillusionment, we have the capacity to maintain our joy of discovery. That joy, and the joy it will eventually bring to future patients, is what fuels the surgeon-scientist [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>].</Para>

            <Para ID="Par40" TextBreak="No">To be a great surgical leader, one needs to take risks. You need to be flexible. You need to be persistent. You need to have integrity. You need to know when to move on and not overstay your term. You need to share the glory, take all of the blame, celebrate other's successes and laugh a lot. Women can do these jobs as well as men – there is no mystery or special handshake even though some would try to make you believe that there is. Women can lead in their own skin now- you can do it your way. There are women around to be your boss, your partner and your chairs, division chiefs, fellow, residents and students. They are watching all of us as they will be the leaders of the future.</Para>
