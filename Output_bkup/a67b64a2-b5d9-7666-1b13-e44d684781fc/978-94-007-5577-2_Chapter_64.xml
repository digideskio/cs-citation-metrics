              <Para>The present work aims to studying the local to regional atmospheric pollution transport and transformation processes over Bulgaria and to tracking and characterizing the main pathways and processes that lead to atmospheric composition formation in the region. The US EPA Models-3 system is chosen as a modelling tool. As the NCEP Global Analysis Data with 1° resolution is used as meteorological background, the MM5 and CMAQ nesting capabilities are applied for downscaling the simulations to a 9 km resolution over Balkans and 3 km over Bulgaria. The TNO emission inventory is used as emission input. Special pre-processing procedures are created for introducing temporal profiles and speciation of the emissions. The study is based on a large number of numerical simulations carried out to four emission scenarios – with all the emissions and with excluded biogenic emissions, emissions from energetics and road transport. Some results from the numerical simulations concerning the main features of the atmospheric composition in Bulgaria and the contribution of the different emission categories are demonstrated in the paper.</Para>

              <Para>Air Quality (AQ) is a key element for the well-being and quality of life of European citizens. Bulgaria also faces AQ problems. It should be noted that, while in Western Europe the photo-oxidant and PM air pollution are at present the major environmental problem, in Bulgaria the classic acidifying pollutants (SO<Subscript>2</Subscript>, NOx,), the heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Pb) and the persistent organic pollutants are still a serious problem and so the study of their environmental impact is absolutely necessary. The reduction of the emissions of these compounds is a major task in the environmental policy of the country.</Para>
              <Para>The air pollution transport is subject to a different scale phenomena, each characterized by specific atmospheric dynamic mechanisms, chemical transformations, typical time scales etc. The air pollution pattern is formed as a result of interaction of different processes, so knowing the contribution of each for different meteorological conditions and given emission spatial configuration and temporal behavior is by all means important. That is why the one of the overall study goals is to make some evaluations of the contribution of different processes to the local to regional pollution over the Balkans and/or Bulgaria.</Para>
              <Para>The main scientific challenge of local to regional atmospheric composition pattern modelling probably is the accounting for the strong dependence of concentrations on fluctuations of local and regional meteorological conditions, the complex interaction of transport scales (different life times of the pollutants make it even more complex), uncertainties and responses to emission forcing and boundary conditions, both introducing information noise.</Para>

              <Para>The simulations are based on the US EPA Model-3 system [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00641">1</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR00644">4</CitationRef>]. The MM5/CMAQ simulations were performed day by day for 8 years – from 2000 to 2007. Thus a quite extensive data base was created, which could be used for different studies and considerations of the main features and origins of the atmospheric composition in Bulgaria.</Para>
              <Para>The large scale (background) meteorological data used by the study is the NCEP Global Analysis Data with 1° × 1° resolution. At the moment the created database contains all the necessary information since year 2000.</Para>
              <Para>The TNO high resolution emission inventory [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00646">6</CitationRef>] is exploited. The TNO emissions are distributed over ten SNAPs classifying pollution sources according the processes leading to harmful material release to the atmosphere. The inventory contains eight pollutants: CH<Subscript>4</Subscript>, CO, NH<Subscript>3</Subscript>, NMVOC (VOC), NOx, SOx, PM10 and PM2.5. The biogenic emissions, which depend on the vegetation type and the meteorological conditions, are calculated by the SMOKE model. The temporal allocation is made on the base of daily, weekly and monthly profiles, provided in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00645">5</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>Four emission scenarios will be considered in the present paper: Simulations with all the emissions, simulations with biogenic emissions and the emissions of SNAP categories 1 (energetics) and 7 (road transport) for Bulgaria reduced by a factor of 0.8.</Para>

              <Para>The most simple atmospheric composition evaluations are, of course, the surface concentrations. By averaging over the 8-year simulated fields ensemble the mean annual and seasonal surface concentrations can be obtained and treated as respective “typical” daily concentration patterns. That can be seen in the plots (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00641">64.1</InternalRef>) and it is not surprising: the big cities, the road network and the big power plants are clearly outlined in the surface concentrations.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00641">

What can be seen in the plots does not defy the common sense and does not oppose the schematic concepts about how the air pollution near earth surface is formed. SO<Subscript>2</Subscript> has its minimums during daytime and its concentrations are higher during the winter than those in the summer. The ozone concentrations, as they should, have their maximum during daytime and are higher in the warmer part of the year.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00642">

              <Para>The contributions of different emission categories to different species surface concentrations have different diurnal course and different importance. The biogenic emissions have near to zero and negative contributions for O3 during the winter. Smaller and more significant differences than those of summer could be seen, this is quite natural, of course, having in mind that in the warm period of the year the biogenic emissions are higher. That is an important result which means, in particular, that the ozone in Bulgaria during the winter is mostly due to transport from other countries.</Para>
              <Para>The contribution of the emission from SNAP categories 1 and 7, which are the major sources of the other ozone precursor – nitrogen oxides, is also small. This once again is an indirect indicator that the surface ozone in Bulgaria is to a small extend due to domestic sources, but is mostly imported.</Para>

              <Para>The performed numerical experiments produced a huge volume of information which have to be carefully analyzed and generalized so that some final conclusions could be made.</Para>
              <Para>The demonstrations, presented in the present paper are just a first glance on the atmospheric composition status in Bulgaria, so very few decisive conclusions can be made at this stage of the study.</Para>
              <Para>The obtained ensemble of numerical simulation results is extensive enough to allow statistical treatment – calculating not only the mean concentrations and different SNAP categories contribution mean fields but also standard deviations, skewness, etc. with their dominant temporal modes (seasonal and/or diurnal variations). Some advanced and sophisticated methods for statistical treatment of the results should also be appropriately applied in order to: study the atmospheric pollution transport and transformation processes from urban to local to regional (Balkan and country) scales. Track and characterize the main pathways and processes that lead to atmospheric composition formation in different scales, and provide high quality scientifically robust assessments of the atmospheric composition and its origin – the air pollution fields response to emission changes (model sensitivity to emission input) is obviously a task of great practical importance, obviously connected with formulating short-term (current) pollution mitigating decisions and long-term pollution abatement strategies.</Para>
