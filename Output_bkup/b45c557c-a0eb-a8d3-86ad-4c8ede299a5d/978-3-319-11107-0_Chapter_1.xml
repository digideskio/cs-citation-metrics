              <Heading>Defining Leadership</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par3" TextBreak="No">Leadership is an <Emphasis Type="Italic">attribute</Emphasis> that involves a combination of a <Emphasis Type="Italic">meaningful vision</Emphasis> with the ability to <Emphasis Type="Italic">influence others by non-coercive means to act</Emphasis> in a certain way. These two components of leadership are profoundly influenced by the context of the environment, the time at which the event under discussion occurs, and the circumstances that are present. Furthermore, the leadership we will be discussing is anchored by moral values. This moral imperative differentiates human leadership from that of other species and plays an important role in the development of the vision. The ability to convince or influence followers by non-coercive means frequently requires the use of emotional intelligence and the establishment of a bond with the followers that is based on trust. In other species, the development of trust is profound and total and follows genetic and phenotypic expressions that make most of the participants of the group natural followers of the one that expresses the ‘alpha’ character. For example, a flock of birds or a pack of wolves self-defines with a leader at the front. Followers are convinced that the leader is aware of the location of the food, the safe environment, and the warm weather. This trust is so profound that in instances when the leader is wrong the entire group perishes.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par4" TextBreak="No">As we move up from the animal kingdom, leadership takes on new characteristics. Indeed, leadership can be identified in almost all human endeavors. Whether in education, healthcare, industry, commerce, or finance, a person or persons emerge that are able to articulate a vision in such a way that others have a tendency to follow. However, quite differently from the animal kingdom, each of these endeavors is complex and the complexity leads to the need for different <Emphasis Type="Italic">levels of leadership</Emphasis>. This is an important concept because as we explore the values associated with the practice of leadership, we will be assuming that there are infinite levels of leadership. Another important difference between human leadership and that of the animal kingdom is that, as we shall see, a good part of a leader’s work is to influence, manage, and therefore “lead” those above him/her. Leadership is thus an attribute applicable as much to a president of a large corporation, a director of a unit, or a manager of a section, as it is to lower-level employees. All that is required to exercise leadership is the presence of at least two individuals and the ability of one to influence the other.</Para>

              <Heading>The Origin of Leaders</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par5" TextBreak="No">A theory espoused by T. Carlyle in 1841 “Trait Leadership” suggests that “great men born with certain personal talents, health, or physical characteristics have the capacity to affect change” and become leaders [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. For some time it was believed therefore that leadership was God given – a part of the genetic make-up. In 1884 Herbert Spencer challenged that concept and described the “situational” theory of leadership which suggested that leaders rise to the circumstances [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. Spencer proposed that the dominant feature in leadership is the environment, represented by challenges, and that it is those challenges that allow leaders to emerge. These two theories are not necessarily contradictory as it is possible that when the appropriate environmental challenges occur, the individuals likely to emerge are those with a genetic predisposition to do so. However, we know of individuals who throughout their lives did not manifest the traits associated with leadership, and who were more predisposed to be followers, and yet when faced with extraordinary circumstances became strong leaders. There is another theory which suggests that personal will and inspiration can give rise to the appropriate vision, which when expressed in certain ways, inspires others to follow. Deepak Chopra in his book “The Soul of Leadership” describes how one can “look into one’s self and lead from the soul’s unlimited wisdom” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. This is the so-called “look and listen” theory in which the individual looks into his/her soul and reflects in order to create the appropriate vision. This theory suggests that most human beings with the ability to read their own feelings, to “look” into their soul, can derive a vision that expresses the moral values of the individual to a greater extent than those generated by other means or coming from circumstances outside the person. These theories, as well as others that have tried to explain leadership, strongly support our belief that leadership skills can be learned and can therefore be practiced in all environments at all levels. It also supports the theory that in the exercise of leadership a person brings her or his own set of values and style and therefore to some extent leadership is “personal.” Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">1.1</InternalRef> shows some of the values associated with leadership. Several studies have looked at how followers grade each one of these personal values in terms of their respect and trust towards their leaders. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">1.2</InternalRef> shows a representative value scale on the views of followers towards values expressed by leaders. <Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab1">

              <Para ID="Par7" TextBreak="No">Emotional intelligence has been defined as a “personal attribute that facilitates social and professional relationships” by Goleman [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. As was the case with leadership, some have thought that emotional intelligence is something that one is born with. It is now clear that this is something that, to some extent, can be learned and practiced by everyone willing to do so, although it may come more easily to one individual than another. According to Goleman and Mayer there are five stages in the development of emotional intelligence, each representing a step higher in the process: <UnorderedList Mark="None">

The ideal is to reach a level when we do not have to modulate the expression but we simply feel less emotional stress.</Para>

Now that we know what others are thinking or feeling at a given time under a certain set of circumstances, our ability to influence those feelings determines to some extent the success of the leader. Thus one can think of leadership as an activity motivating people to do something because they want to or believe in it. This is the ultimate exercise of leadership: influencing others to the extent they are convinced that a certain thing must be done or a specific action should be taken (and can exercise their own influence on peers and other followers as well).</Para>

                        <Emphasis Type="Bold">Creating the vision</Emphasis> – The creation of a successful vision must be associated with meaning and significance; it must be anchored in the leader’s values and guided by his or her moral compass. When developing the vision, leaders must use their imagination; they must question all aspects of an issue. For example, the fact that something is working well does not mean it will work well forever, and in fact even if it works well now, one may be able to improve it. In other words, leaders need to “free” their imagination to be able to create a new environment, system, device – they must be bold. For example, Colin Powell said, “You don’t know what you can get away with until you try” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. He encourages us to follow the principle of “it is easier to get forgiveness than permission” and tells us that “good leaders don’t wait for official blessing to try things out. Indeed, if one asks enough people for permission one will inevitably come up against someone who believes his or her job is to say ‘no’” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. It is also important during the development of the vision to be able to gauge and understand the needs of the followers. While vision may sometimes, by its very nature, ignore some of the immediate gratification of the followers, it is important to always look for ways to relate the benefits of the mission to the followers. The mission is then much more likely to succeed.</Para>

                        <Emphasis Type="Bold">Articulating the purpose</Emphasis> – Once the vision has been created, the leader must be able to articulate and to “sell” the purpose to the followers. The key to that effort is the way in which the purpose is expressed coupled with the determination to achieve the goals. It is important that one offers strong points of view that focus everyone on the shared vision, delivers clear expectations to the followers, and demonstrates the need to act with determination to achieve. In the words of Colin Powell, “Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. The ripple effect of a leader’s positive words inspires an optimistic response; in the same way, cynicism and pessimism engender a parallel negative response. Leaders who whine and blame engender those same behaviors among their colleagues. In expressing the purpose a leader should do it in a fashion that conveys, “we can change things here, we can achieve awesome goals, we can be the best.”</Para>

                        <Emphasis Type="Bold">Generating and sustaining trust</Emphasis> – The best way to generate trust is to be a role-model; in other words to ‘walk the walk’ and to have consistency between words and actions. It is important that the followers believe the leader is as engaged as they are and that the leader follows his or her own advice and does the same as what he/she asks of the followers. Trust is generated by listening closely to the followers, communicating candidly with them, and acting with reliability and consistency. While building trust, leaders must encourage openness, disagreement, and even controversial points of view while expressing confidence in the followers in keeping with the concept of the “wisdom of crowd” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. The more the leader listens, the more the leader will learn about the needs and expectations of the followers and increase the chance of generating valuable ideas. The process by which trust is generated is slow, progressive and fragile. Good leaders pay intense attention to it. Sustaining trust requires constancy, transparency and role modeling, all the time and every time. By contrast, it only takes a few minutes, a single expression or one act that is perceived as not worthy of trust to destroy the trust that has been generated.</Para>

                        <Emphasis Type="Bold">Action</Emphasis> – Leaders must translate the purpose of the vision into action. They must induce sufficient trust among the followers to inspire them to take action. There will be times when, despite having put substantial effort into the development of the vision (even when that vision was properly articulated to a group of followers that trust the leader), the resulting action falls short of expected. Good leaders recognize that “failure” is part of life and eventually become more comfortable with it. Good leaders will analyze the cause of the failure, study the hurdles that impaired the achievement of the mission in detail, and move forward. These leaders recognize that there is often more to learn from “failure” than from “success” and that openness to those lessons is crucial. Sometimes it is the complexity of the task; sometimes it is the circumstances or the environment. The only way not to fail is not to try. As …….St Marie said “the harbor is the safest place for a boat but boats were not made to stay in harbors.” Leaders must remember that “you miss 100 % of the shots you do not take” as Wayne Gretzky said. As much as optimism and positivity are important in creating vision and building trust, these traits are even more important in sustaining trust and moving forward in the face of “failure.” Leaders are “pragmatic dreamers” or “practical idealists”. Leadership is about developing a vision, articulating it with passion, generating trust, and moving the followers to action.</Para>

                  <Para ID="Par19" TextBreak="No">A leader is best when people barely know he or she exists. When his or her work is done or the aim fulfilled, people will say: We did it ourselves. – Lao Tzu</Para>

              <Para ID="Par20" TextBreak="No">As was pointed out at the beginning of our chapter, leadership is an attribute. As such, it is exercised by an individual during the course of their activities. It is therefore important to review the time distribution of leadership activities and the elements that facilitate and impair its exercise. Dee Hock, founder and former CEO of VISA, suggested that leaders should invest 50 % of their time leading themselves [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. That time is used for reflection; it is used to search inwardly and to develop a personal vision with regard to ethics, motivation and direction. It is a time to look “into the soul” for guidance, to examine reality and to develop an environment conducive to achieving the shared goals expressed by this vision. Hock suggests that approximately 20 % of the time should be invested in leading those with authority over the leader. This is a very interesting concept because it expresses “upward” leadership, in which a considerable amount of time is invested in the process of leading and checking with those who are above the leader. It is as important for a good leader to “sell” his or her vision to those above as it is to sell it to those below. In fact, it is probably more important, and it is certainly often more difficult to communicate to those above. In those situations while the “vision” will be the same, the “articulation of that vision” has to be done in such a way as to make the boss believe that it is her/his idea, rather than the person who created it. There are very few things that require more use of emotional intelligence than creating ideas in superior’s minds that eventually become so well anchored as to make believe they originated there. Hock suggests that 15 % of the time should be spent leading peers. This is the recognition that an organization’s fulfillment of the goals would be improved if all the units are able to advance at the same time and that the leader him or herself will be better positioned if his/her ideas have been “bought” by peers. Hock leaves only 15 % of the leader’s time to lead the subordinates. He also emphasizes the concept of service leadership saying, “If you do not understand that you work for your subordinates, then you know nothing about leadership. You only know tyranny.”</Para>
              <Para ID="Par21" TextBreak="No">This breakdown of time that Hock describes is central to a model known as meta-leadership, representing three of the five components of meta-leadership: leading down, leading up, and leading across [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. These components are built on the foundation of self-awareness and situational awareness that we have previously described as key to leadership.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par22" TextBreak="No">Two common errors in managing the time spent on leadership are what we call “reverse delegation” and “making other people’s problems your own”. Reverse delegation is always tempting for a leader and it can be described as the process by which something that needs to be done is done by the leader, rather than being delegated to a subordinate. While this may save the leader some time in the short term, by avoiding spending the time to teach, coach, and wait for a turn around by a less experienced follower, it is not a good strategy for at least two reasons. First, it condemns the leader to doing the task again next time it presents – so ultimately the time invested becomes greater, and second, the process demeans the followers. Instead, this can be turned to the leader’s advantage by using the opportunity to show confidence in the followers which improves morale, enhances development and nurtures loyalty toward the leader. Furthermore, when the followers are allowed to take risks and encouraged to develop methods that achieve the tasks in a better way than the leader originally envisioned, leadership is at its best. The leader has in fact created another leader.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par23" TextBreak="No">Making other people’s problems your own is a tendency that many leaders have. As a leader, one has no business becoming involved in the troubles of subordinates, even with the best intentions. There is a delicate balance between trying to help other people with their problems and making those problems your own.</Para>

              <Heading>Relating to Followers: Styles of Leadership</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par24" TextBreak="No">When studying relationships between leaders and followers it is important to remember that the leader has to find ways of <Emphasis Type="Italic">motivating</Emphasis> the followers. Two different approaches have been identified in this motivational exercise: one is the <Emphasis Type="Italic">transactional</Emphasis> and one is the <Emphasis Type="Italic">transformational</Emphasis>. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">transactional approach</Emphasis> is directly related to strict performance and outcomes criteria. The focus is on successfully completing a task and on rewarding that behavior (promotion, pay raise, etc.). When the task is not completed there is a lack of reward or a punishment (no pay, demotion, or dismissal). The <Emphasis Type="Italic">transformational style</Emphasis> is “principle driven”. This approach embodies dedication to the larger organizational mission. It is “mission centric” and not “task oriented”. It creates meaning for the followers rather than specific rewards. It converts leaders into moral agents and is usually a more enduring style of leadership. In today’s world the <Emphasis Type="Italic">transformational style</Emphasis> is probably more appropriate.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par25" TextBreak="No">Within these two general approaches, there are several styles of leadership.

Of all the styles of leadership, the authoritative style is the most effective at driving every aspect of climate as the leader has identified clear objectives and demands performance. The authoritative style works well in almost any business situation but is particularly effective when a business is adrift. An authoritative leader charts a new course and sends the followers with a fresh long-term vision. This style is a lot less effective when the leader is working with a team of experts or peers who are, or believe they are, more experienced than the leader. It is, therefore, less likely to work in the medical arena.</Para>

By its nature this style builds the trust of the followers, and provides an excellent way to drive responsibility. One of the main drawbacks is the substantial amount of time needed for decisions and in some instances, inaction from endless meetings. This approach works best when a leader is uncertain about the best direction to take and needs ideas and guidance from followers.</Para>

This style is about improving and having everyone do things better and faster, including the leader. Poor performers are required to do better or be left out. This style can lead to poor morale and destruction given that most followers will feel overwhelmed by the pacesetter’s demands. Work becomes not a matter of doing the best along a clear course as much second guessing what the leader wants.</Para>

Of all the styles of leadership the coercive style is one of the least effective in most situations. In this case the leader makes top down decisions and this tends to inhibit new ideas. The followers’ sense of responsibility evaporates because they are unable to act on their own initiative, lose ownership and feel little accountability toward their performance. Occasionally coercive leadership is important to exercise but should be used with caution.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par32" TextBreak="No">The most important thing to remember is that an individual does not function with only one style of leadership. All styles are necessary from time to time. The circumstances determine the predominant style of leadership that should be exercised at any given time as each style is best suited for a given set of circumstances. Moreover, a single style is usually less likely to lead to success than the combination of two or more styles. The most effective executives use a collection of distinct leadership styles, each in the right measure at just the right time. Such flexibility can be difficult to put into action but it pays off in performance and better yet, it can be learned. For example, during an emergency with a turn of events that was unexpected and requires immediate correction, the combination of an authoritative or a coercive style may be most appropriate. In this situation the use of a democratic or coaching style may be less appropriate. However the pure use of an authoritative style during an emergency can lead to fragmentation and distrust from the rest of the team and may leave the leader all by him or herself. Therefore adding affiliative or pacesetting aspects at that time may modulate the authoritative style and lead to the best outcome.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par33" TextBreak="No">Strong leadership styles have historically highlighted traits associated with masculinity. In fact, most literature on leadership refers to the “he” leader. It is no surprise that in a current survey of 7,000 leadership positions in America men outnumber women in senior leadership positions nearly 4 to 1 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. On the surface this raises a moral dilemma, given that about 50 % of the world’s population is composed of women and that today in America women outnumber men as graduates of higher education.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par34" TextBreak="No">In his presidential address to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, Douglas Wood emphasized the need, particularly in academic surgery, to embrace leadership traits historically thought of as “feminine” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. He believes that “selfless leadership” – a more modern, accepted, and effective form of leadership – is more likely to be present among women. In fact, a study by Gerzema and D’Antonio that identified 125 different human behavioral traits showed that across age, gender, and cultures, people around the world felt that traits often identified as “feminine” correlated strongly with making the world a better place [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. The authors found that the traditional “feminine” attributes and values are now more strongly related to leadership than the “macho paradigm” characterized by more “black and white” thinking and the need for control. Traits such as “displaying high integrity and honesty,” “developing others,” “building relationships,” and “collaboration and teamwork” are also traditionally thought to be “feminine” traits. However, it is important to note that traits that are “feminine” or “masculine” can be present across genders. Indeed, one study showed that women scored higher than men in 12 out of 16 traits of leadership including such traditionally masculine traits as “taking initiative”, “driving for results,” or “establishing stretch goals” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par35" TextBreak="No">In his lecture, Wood noted that “the characteristics of selfless leadership emphasize trust, empathy and the capacity to listen and to relate to others [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. More than ever before, leadership is about the expression of tolerance combined with integrity and confidence. It requires courage to be both vulnerable and connected to others and it requires humility to accept codependency and acknowledgement of one’s own weaknesses and vulnerability. It is not about competition. It is not about raising oneself up above others; it is certainly not about pulling down those around you. Modern leadership is about elevating the people around you and perhaps people not even noticing that you are the reason.”</Para>

            <Heading>Leadership in Medicine</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par36" TextBreak="No">In the latter part of 1800s and throughout the 1900s, the educational system prevailing in medicine emphasized individuality and did not take into consideration the concept of teams, and by extension the concept of leadership. For example, physicians had traditionally been taught to arrive early, review everything personally, and check on their patients with their own eyes. Traditional teaching emphasized “dependence on no one but yourself.” Indeed, the quality of a physician was measured by the personal standards that were practiced without reference to the surrounding environment. In the latter part of the twentieth century it became clear that with the emergence of new drugs, tests, devices, and techniques – a cycle of innovation that was constantly increasing the complexity of the environment in which medicine was practiced – physicians and other health care providers needed to focus their expertise quite narrowly. This narrow focus combined with individuality that had been encouraged in medicine led our system to become fragmented; the care provided to patients became disorganized by its very nature. This chaotic care fueled an increasing interest in the development of teams. This meant that the physicians and other health care providers had to learn how to relate to one another, express respect for others’ opinions, transfer care of the patients or at least portions of their care to others, and delegate the performance of tests and procedures. It was the need to coordinate the work of ever enlarging teams of providers that brought about the emergence of leadership as an important concept in the practice of medicine. Initially, leadership emerged as an expression of high level management of a complex set of circumstances by a difficult (mostly individualist) group. Today we recognize that to maximize performance we need “high performing” teams: that is, teams capable of impeccable communication, mutual support and situational awareness led by individuals knowledgeable in the art and practice of leadership. With that, we can say medicine has undergone a 180° turn when it comes to the relationship between its members. For example, within a team of healthcare providers <Emphasis Type="Italic">authority</Emphasis> (“this is how I want it to be done!” “this is how my teachers taught me”) was replaced by <Emphasis Type="Italic">evidence</Emphasis>. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">autonomy</Emphasis> exercised traditionally by physicians who practiced in an individualistic environment had to change to a spirit of <Emphasis Type="Italic">collaboration</Emphasis> with other members of the team. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Assertion</Emphasis> of facts was changed to <Emphasis Type="Italic">measurement</Emphasis>
              <Emphasis Type="BoldItalic">,</Emphasis> publicly expressed with <Emphasis Type="Italic">transparency</Emphasis>, and <Emphasis Type="Italic">self-interest</Emphasis> which, although never sanctioned prevailed among many providers, was replaced by focusing our actions to serve <Emphasis Type="Italic">public (and patient’s) interest</Emphasis>. As these monumental changes occurred at the turn of the century, leadership, in terms of knowledge and application, became more important in the life of physicians. It became important in relationships with patients, in relationships with other colleagues, in relationship to the creation of divisions, departments, and teams of healthcare, centers of excellence, etc. and therefore every physician had to learn to exercise the expression of leadership at one level or another. In fact, the only choice left was to lead or to follow.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par37" TextBreak="No">Beyond the emergence of systems of care, another important factor that fueled the interest in the practice of leadership has been an increasing blurring of traditional boundaries between specialties. Indeed, in the past, the boundaries between most medical specialties and most surgical specialists were well defined. The emergence of newer diagnostic and therapeutic means and innovations in the delivery of care have, in the last two decades, made those boundaries more difficult to define. For example, cardiologists perform revascularization procedures that were once only in the hands of surgeons, and many cardiac surgeons today perform interventional studies in the heart that were once only part of a cardiology practice. The same can be said of gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists, and gastrointestinal surgeons. Managing these relationships is difficult, but where leadership really emerges is when we as a profession can create new working relationships and out-of-the-box modalities that improve patient care, decrease inefficiencies, avoid waste and decrease cost. Creating “new” systems is and will be difficult, but that is only the expression of the <Emphasis Type="Italic">vision,</Emphasis> the first part of leadership. Making them work, develop and grow (i.e., <Emphasis Type="Italic">influencing others to act in a certain way under non-coercive means)</Emphasis> is the true expression of leadership. The emergence of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and patient-centered medical homes as even more complex systems of care, and the creation of large multi-hospital groups through mergers will add to the complexity of care delivery and finances associated with the work of the physician, including understanding and clarifying the distribution of payments for services among different providers of care. The redesign of current systems is aimed at global improvements in quality and cost. To be successful it will require effective care teams and good management of local operations – what Bohmer calls “Clinical MicroSystems” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. Heads of medical and nursing departments have obvious leadership goals but these goals will only be possible with simultaneous parallel leadership by clinicians deeper in the organization, usually without any formal title, leadership job description, or authority. This is an example of <Emphasis Type="Italic">leadership at all levels</Emphasis> which we previously discussed. Indeed, these “clinical microsystems” as described by Bohmer are composed and often controlled by second and third line clinicians whose primary work is patient care and who, for the most part, have little interest in leadership. Nevertheless, these physicians are key in establishing purpose for their microsystem. They are also key in measuring and assigning importance to transactional performance measures, such as clinic volume and other measures of individual productivity that heretofore have reinforced the individualistic perspective against that of the team. The complexity of their work is compounded by the need to ensure that their clinical microsystem can achieve the goals of the team. Bohmer identifies the big challenge as the need to provide care that balances “between evidence based medicine and patient centric care which requires the flexibility to deliver standard care where the evidence is strong and customized care where it is not.” In these microsystems, the final task of the second and third line physicians is improving performance using the measurements acquired during their work.</Para>

            <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par38" TextBreak="No">In conclusion, leadership implies an ability to influence (processes, people, actions) by non-coercive means. Leadership is an attribute and as such can be applied by every person through most of their actions. Some people are born with the traits of leadership, and on occasion environmental factors create the need for leadership that emerges. Both those who were born with traits of leadership and those who learned it have a chance to develop leadership through self-awareness (looking into themselves) and situational awareness (looking at the surrounding circumstances). Leadership is rooted in the core values of an individual; those values provide character and are expressed during the exercise of leadership. Leadership is useless if it does not take into consideration the social contract, and it must be anchored in profound and clear moral values. Leaders do not exist in a vacuum. The best leaders are capable of contextual diagnosis (determining what the circumstances are and matching the vision with reality checks). True leaders use the theory of adaptation; they constantly transform their conduct and perspective to match the needs of the circumstances. They change their style and their actions to reach socially desirable goals. They have developed profound knowledge of emotional intelligence and practice its principles at every turn. They understand that the circumstances, the times and the places in which leadership will be expressed require different styles. Leadership is doing what is right, not what you have the right to do. Lastly, as Martin Luther King, Jr. stated, a good leader is “obedient to the unenforceable” because good leadership goes beyond obedience to the law, beyond what is expected [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. It creates an environment where all develop and grow while serving the greater need of humanity.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par39" TextBreak="No">Leadership is essential to modern medicine, and physicians who become knowledgeable in its art, its science and its practice are likely to be personally and socially successful and to leave a meaningful legacy.</Para>
