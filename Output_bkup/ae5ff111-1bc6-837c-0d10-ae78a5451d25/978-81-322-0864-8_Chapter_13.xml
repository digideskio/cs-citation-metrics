Some species form a scum on the water, but high concentrations may also be present throughout the affected water. Surface scums, where they occur, represent a specific hazard to human health because of their particularly high toxin contact. Contact, especially by children, should be avoided. They produce a diverse range of small molecules which are hazardous to human and animal health. Their harmful effects range from mild to serious and include gastrointestinal upsets, skin irritations and liver and neurological damage. Reactive and proreactive measures of cyanobacteria are also defined. The reduction of cyanobacterial toxin problems in natural and controlled water as a potential benefit of eutrophication is also dealt with.</Para>

          <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) produce toxins that may present a hazard for drinking water safety. These toxins (microcystins, nodularins, saxitoxins, anatoxin-a, anatoxin-a(s), cylindrospermopsin) are structurally diverse, and their effects range from liver damage, including liver cancer, to neurotoxicity. The occurrence of cyanobacteria and their toxins in water bodies used for the production of drinking water poses a technical challenge for water utility managers. With respect to their removal in water treatment procedures, of the more than 60 microcystin congeners, microcystin-LR (<Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">L</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">l</Emphasis>-leucine; R, <Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">l</Emphasis>-arginine) is the best studied cyanobacterial toxin, whereas information for the other toxins is largely lacking. In response to the growing concern about nonlethal acute and chronic effects of microcystins, the World Health Organization has recently set a new provisional guideline value for microcystin-LR of 1.0Â mg/L drinking water. This will lead to further efforts by water suppliers to develop effective treatment procedures to remove these toxins. These treatments may not be sufficient during bloom situations or when a high organic load is present, and toxin levels should therefore be monitored during the water treatment process. In order to perform an adequate human risk assessment of microcystin exposure via drinking water, the issue of water treatment by-products will have to be addressed in the future.</Para>

          <Heading>The Disease and How It Affects People: The Cause</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Disease due to cyanobacterial toxins varies according to the type of toxin and the type of water or water-related exposure (drinking, skin contact, etc.). Humans are affected with a range of symptoms including skin irritation, stomach cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, fever, sore throat, headache, muscle and joint pain, blisters of the mouth and liver damage. Swimmers in water containing cyanobacterial toxins may suffer allergic reactions, such as asthma, eye irritation, rashes and blisters around the mouth and nose. Animals, birds and fish can also be poisoned by high levels of toxin-producing cyanobacteria.</Para>

            <Heading>The Cause</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Cyanobacteria are also known as blue-green algae, so named because these organisms have characteristics of both algae and bacteria, although they are now classified as bacteria. The blue-green colour comes from their ability to photosynthesise, like plants. Cyanobacterial toxins are classified by how they affect the human body. Hepatotoxins (which affect the liver) are produced by some strains of the cyanobacteria, namely, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Microcystis</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Anabaena</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Oscillatoria</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Nodularia</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Nostoc</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Cylindrospermopsis</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Umezakia</Emphasis>.

          <Para TextBreak="No">The organisms can grow rapidly in favourable conditions, such as calm nutrient-rich fresh or marine waters in warm climates or during the late summer months in cooler parts of the world. Blooms of cyanobacteria tend to occur repeatedly in the same water, posing a risk of repeated exposure to some human populations. Cyanobacterial toxins in lakes, ponds and dugouts in various parts of the world have long been known to cause poisoning in animals and humans. One of the earliest reports of their toxic effects was in China 1,000 years ago (Sivonen and Jones <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">1999</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Cyanobacteria have been linked to illness in various regions throughout the world, including North and South America, Africa, Australia, Europe, Scandinavia and China. There are no reliable figures for the number of people affected worldwide. The only documented and scientifically substantiated human deaths due to cyanobacterial toxins have been due to exposure during dialysis. People exposed through drinking water and recreational water have required intensive hospital care.</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">Algae are vitally important to marine and freshwater ecosystems, and most species of algae are not harmful. Algal blooms occur in natural waters used for drinking and/or recreation when certain types of microscopic algae grow quickly in water, often in response to changes in levels of chemicals such as nitrogen and phosphorus from fertiliser, in the water. Algal blooms can deplete the oxygen and block the sunlight that other organisms need to live, and some can produce toxins that are harmful to the health of the environment, plants, animals and people. Harmful algal blooms (HAB) have threatened beaches, drinking water sources and even the boating venue for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and red tides are examples of algae that can bloom and produce toxins that may be harmful to human and animal health. HABs can occur in marine, estuarine and freshwaters, and HABs appear to be increasing along the coastlines and in the surface waters of the United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). HSB epidemiologists have led a number of studies to investigate the public health impacts of blue-green algae blooms and Florida red tide. The studies have demonstrated that there is potential for exposure to potent HAB-related toxins during recreational and occupational activities on water bodies with ongoing blooms.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, grow in any type of water and are photosynthetic (use sunlight to create food and support life). Cyanobacteria live in terrestrial, fresh, brackish or marine water. They usually are too small to be seen but sometimes can form visible colonies, called an algal bloom. Cyanobacteria have been found among the oldest fossils on earth and are one of the largest groups of bacteria.

          <Heading>Cyanobacterial Blooms and How They Are Formed</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Cyanobacterial blooms (a kind of algal bloom) occur when organisms that are normally present grow exuberantly. Within a few days, a bloom of cyanobacteria can cause clear water to become cloudy. The blooms usually float to the surface and can be many inches thick, especially near the shoreline. Cyanobacterial blooms can form in warm, slow-moving waters that are rich in nutrients such as fertiliser runoff or septic tank overflows. Blooms can occur at any time but most often occur in late summer or early fall. They can occur in marine, estuarine and fresh waters, but the blooms of greatest concern are the ones that occur in freshwater, such as drinking water reservoirs or recreational waters. Some cyanobacterial blooms can look like foam, scum or mats on the surface of freshwater lakes and ponds. The blooms can be blue, bright green, brown or red and may look like paint floating on the water. Some blooms may not affect the appearance of the water. As algae in a cyanobacterial bloom die, the water may smell bad.</Para>

          <Heading>Harmful Marine Algae</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Harmful marine algae, such as those associated with red tides, occur in the ocean and can produce toxins that may harm or kill fish and marine animals. There are many kinds of marine algae that produce toxins that can accumulate in shellfish. In USA, one of the illnesses that may result from eating algal toxin-contaminated shellfish is neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP). NSP is caused by eating shellfish contaminated with brevetoxins, which are produced by <Emphasis Type="Italic">Karenia brevis</Emphasis>, the marine algae associated with Florida red tides. NSP is a short-term illness with neurologic symptoms (such as tingling fingers or toes) and gastrointestinal symptoms. There are very few cases of NSP in the USA because coastal states carefully monitor their shellfish beds and close the beds to harvesting if high concentrations of brevetoxins are detected in the water or the shellfish. Brevetoxins may also be in the air along the Gulf coast of Florida during Florida red tide events, and many symptoms such as eye irritation and a sore throat occur in healthy people. People who have asthma may have symptoms, such as chest tightness, that last for several days after exposure. Ciguatera tides fish poisoning is another disease associated with toxins produced by marine algae. The toxin responsible, called ciguatoxin, accumulates through the food web, and very high levels may exist in reef fish, particularly (but not only) large carnivorous reef fish.</Para>

          <Heading>Red Tide</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Algae are vitally important to marine ecosystems, and most species of algae are not harmful. However, under certain environmental conditions, microscopic marine algae called <Emphasis Type="Italic">Karenia brevis</Emphasis> (<Emphasis Type="Italic">K</Emphasis>. <Emphasis Type="Italic">brevis</Emphasis>) grow quickly, creating blooms that can make the ocean appear red or brown. People often call these blooms âred tideâ.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">
            <Emphasis Type="Italic">Karenia brevis</Emphasis> produces powerful toxins called brevetoxins, which have killed millions of fish and other marine organisms. Red tides have damaged the fishing industry, shoreline quality and local economies in states such as Texas and Florida. Because <Emphasis Type="Italic">K</Emphasis>. <Emphasis Type="Italic">brevis</Emphasis> blooms move based on winds and tides, pinpointing a red tide at any given moment is difficult. Red tides occur throughout the world, affecting marine ecosystems in Scandinavia, Japan, the Caribbean and the South Pacific. Scientists first documented a red tide along Floridaâs Gulf Coast in fall 1947, when residents of Venice, Florida, reported thousands of dead fish and a âstinging gasâ in the air, according to Mote Marine Laboratory. However, Florida residents have reported similar events since the mid-1800s.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">In addition to killing fish, brevetoxins can become concentrated in the tissues of shellfish that feed on <Emphasis Type="Italic">K</Emphasis>. <Emphasis Type="Italic">brevis</Emphasis>. People who eat these shellfish may suffer from neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, a food poisoning that can cause severe gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms, such as tingling fingers or toes. The human health effects associated with eating brevetoxin-tainted shellfish are well documented. However, scientists know little about how other types of environmental exposures to brevetoxinâsuch as breathing the air near red tides or swimming in red tidesâmay affect humans. Anecdotal evidence suggests that people who swim among brevetoxins or inhale brevetoxins dispersed in the air may experience irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, as well as coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. Additional evidence suggests that people with existing respiratory illness, such as asthma, may experience these symptoms more severely.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Globally the most frequently found cyanobacterial toxins in blooms from fresh and brackish waters are the cyclic peptide toxins of the microcystin and nodularin family. They pose a major challenge for the production of safe drinking water from surface waters containing cyanobacteria with these toxins. In mouse bioassays, which traditionally have been used to screen toxicity of field and laboratory samples, cyanobacterial hepatotoxins (liver toxins) cause death by liver haemorrhage within a few hours of the acute doses. Microcystins have been characterised from planktonic <Emphasis Type="Italic">Anabaena</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Microcystis</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Oscillatoria</Emphasis> (Planktothrix), <Emphasis Type="Italic">Nostoc</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Anabaenopsis</Emphasis> species, and from terrestrial <Emphasis Type="Italic">Hapalosiphon</Emphasis> genera. Nodularin has been characterised only from <Emphasis Type="Italic">Nodularia spumigena</Emphasis>.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The cyclic peptides are comparatively large natural products, molecular weight (MW) approximately 800â1,100, although small compared with many other cell oligopeptides and polypeptides (proteins) (MWâ&gt;â10,000). They contain either five (nodularins) or seven (microcystins) amino acids, with the two terminal amino acids of the linear peptide being condensed (joined) to form a cyclic compound. They are water soluble, excepting a few somewhat more hydrophobic microcystins, are unable to penetrate directly in the lipid membranes of animal, plant and bacterial cells. Therefore, to elicit their toxic effect, uptake into cells occurs through membrane transporters which otherwise carry essential biochemicals or nutrients. This restricts the target organ range in mammals largely to the liver. In aquatic environments, these toxins usually remain contained within the cyanobacterial cells and are only released in substantial amounts on cell lysis. Along with their high chemical stability and their water solubility, this containment has important implications for their environmental persistence and exposure to humans in surface water bodies.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The first chemical structure of cyanobacterial cyclic peptide toxins was identified in the early 1980s, and the number fully characterised toxin variants has greatly increased during the 1990s. The first such compounds found in freshwater cyanobacteria were cyclic heptapeptides (i.e. they contain seven peptide-linked amino acids) with the general structure of cyclo-(<Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">d</Emphasis>-alanine1-<Emphasis Type="Italic">X</Emphasis>2-<Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">d</Emphasis>-MeAsp3-Z4-Adda5-<Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">d</Emphasis>-glutamate6-Mdha7) in which X and Z are variable L amino acids, <Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">d</Emphasis>-MeAsp3 is <Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">d</Emphasis>-erythro-Ã-methylaspartic acid, and Mdha is N-methyldehydroalanine. The amino acid Adda, (2S,3S,8S,9S)-3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldeca-4,6-dienoic acid, is the most unusual structure in this group of cyanobacterial cyclic peptide toxins (Fig.Â <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">13.4</InternalRef>). These compounds were first isolated from the cyanobacterium <Emphasis Type="Italic">Microcystis aeruginosa</Emphasis>, and therefore the toxins was named microcystins. Structural variations have been reported in all seven amino acids, but most frequently with substitution of <Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">l</Emphasis>-amino acids at positions 2 and 4, and demethylation of amino acids at positions 3 and/or 7. About 60 structural variants of microcystins have been characterised so far from bloom samples and isolated strains of cyanobacteria.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig4">

They are found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, act as endotoxins and elicit strong immune responses in animals. LPS is the major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, contributing greatly to the structural integrity of the bacteria and protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attack. LPS also increases the negative charge of the cell membrane and helps to stabilise the overall membrane structure. It is of crucial importance to gram-negative bacteria, whose death results if it is mutated or removed. LPS is an endotoxin and induces a strong response from normal animal immune systems. It has also been implicated in nonpathogenic aspects of bacterial ecology, including surface adhesion, bacteriophage sensitivity and interactions with predators such as amoebae.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig6">

            <Para TextBreak="No">LPS is required for the proper conformation of its activity. However, smooth LPS will sterically hinder omptins. LPS acts as the prototypical endotoxin because it binds the CD14/TLR4/MD2 receptor complex, which promotes the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in many cell types but especially in macrophages and B cells. In immunology, the term âLPS challengeâ refers to the process of exposing a subject to an LPS that may act as a toxin. LPS is also an exogenous pyrogen (external fever-inducing substance).

The O antigen is attached to the core oligosaccharide and comprises the outermost domain of the LPS molecule. The composition of the O chain varies from strain to strain. For example, there are over 160 different O antigen structures produced by different <Emphasis Type="Italic">E</Emphasis>. <Emphasis Type="Italic">coli</Emphasis> strains (Raetz and Whitfield <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2002</CitationRef>). The presence or absence of O chains determines whether the LPS is considered rough or smooth. Full-length O chains would render the LPS smooth, whereas the absence or reduction of O chains would make the LPS rough (Rittig et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2004</CitationRef>). Bacteria with rough LPS usually have more penetrable cell membranes to hydrophobic antibiotics, since a rough LPS is more hydrophobic. O antigen is exposed on the very outer surface of the bacterial cell and, as a consequence, is a target for recognition by host antibodies.</Para>

Currently, <Emphasis Type="Italic">in vitro</Emphasis> system exists for detection and quantification of saxitoxins, anatoxin-a, cylindrospermopsins and microcystin and nodularins.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Other <Emphasis Type="Italic">in vitro</Emphasis> systems use antibodies generated against the parent toxin in immunoassay (Codd et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2001</CitationRef>; Metcalf and Codd <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2003</CitationRef>). Antibodies against microcystins and saxitoxins have been developed, and results show good correlation with traditional methods of analysis such as HPLC. As the cyanobacterial toxins have molecular weights of less than about 1,000Â Da, these compounds are known as haptens, in that they are unable to invoke an immune response to produce specific antibodies against these compounds and also drastically reduce their toxicity before immunisation.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Cyanobacterial LPS can be quantified by haemagglutination assays. The most common method is the Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay (Anderson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2002</CitationRef>; Rapala et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2002</CitationRef>). Now a number of newly developed systems, such as use of chromogenic substrates, are allowing more accurate LPS quantification. One of the challenges to risk management of LPS problems associated with cyanobacterial blooms is to determine the relative contribution to the cyanobacterial LPS, versus that of co-occurring bacteria, to overall LPS toxicity.</Para>

            <Heading>Concentration of Cyanobacterial Toxins for Analysis</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">When cyanobacterial blooms, scums and mats are present, cyanobacterial toxin concentrations are applicable to direct analysis methods such as HPLC-PDA. However, when cyanobacteria-free or cyanobacterial toxin-containing water samples require analysis, concentration procedures may be required to permit toxin detection by such methods. Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) procedures have been successfully applied to meet these needs. For microcystins, nodularins and anatoxin-a, the use of C<Subscript>18</Subscript>SPE material has allowed successful retention of these cyanotoxins from water matrices. Recent immunoaffinity methods have shown that 15 purified microcystins and nodularins can be successfully retained from water samples with &gt;80% recovery (Arando et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2003</CitationRef>). This use of immunological reagents against the cyanobacterial toxins could have wide and straightforward application for the recovery of the toxins from water for analysis.</Para>

            <Heading>Determination of the Potential for Cyanobacterial Toxin Production</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Increasing research is elucidating the mechanisms of cyanobacterial toxin synthesis. Although the microcystins are peptides, these are synthesised by enzymic mechanisms, rather than via the classical biological mechanism of peptide and protein synthesis involving ribosomal RNA (Kaebernick and Neilan <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">2001</CitationRef>). By analogy with other peptides and alkaloids produced enzymically by microorganisms, genetic methods such as PCR are increasingly being applied to detect the presence of genes for production of microcystins, saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin by cyanobacteria. However, although genes are responsible for the production of cyanobacterial toxins are known and many methods for analysis are available, only the potential for toxin production can be thereby assessed, and depending on the information required, for example, end users and regulatory bodies, toxin analysis by more traditional methods may be necessary.</Para>

          <Heading>Cyanobacterial Toxins as Hazard to Health: Human and Animal Poisoning Episodes</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It is well established that cyanobacterial toxins present hazards to human and health. Mortalities of sheep, cows, horses, pigs, dogs, poultry and fish have occurred as a result of ingestion of cyanobacterial scum, met or bloom material. Microcystins, anatoxin-a, saxitoxins, nodularin, cylindrospermopsin and anatoxin (a) have been identified as causative agents, either alone or in combinations. The most recent and serious known human poisoning episode occurred in Brazil in 1996. Water from a drinking water reservoir, which had recently experienced cyanobacterial blooms, was tinkered to a haemodialysis clinic where it was effectively treated and then administered to haemodialysis patients. As a result, 126 patients were severely affected and 60 patients eventually died over a number of months. About 86% experienced toxic symptoms including tender hepatomegaly and biochemical evidence of liver injury. Severely affected patients also showed a range of neurological impairments. In UK soldiers who indulged in barrel rolling and swimming and canoeing training exercises in water containing Microcystis scum experienced gastrointestinal illness and mucosal membrane blistering with severe atypical pneumonia and indicators of liver damage requiring hospitalisation. The dermal route of cyanobacterial intoxication is responsible for severe contact dermatitis conditions such as âswimmers itchâ and can occur when people swim in sea in contact with cyanobacteria. Other risk activities include showering in ineffectively treated water and during work practices where dermal and respiratory exposure to cyanobacterial blooms and toxins may occur.</Para>

          <Heading>Animal Dosing Studies and Risk Assessment for Production of Human Health</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Although there is large amount of information on the toxicity of individual, purified cyanobacterial toxins, little is known about the effects of multiple dosing. For example, intranasal exposure of mice to microcystin-LR was found to have a toxicity ten times greater than that of oral administration of the toxin by gavage. Examination of the nasal cavities revealed extensive necrosis of the olfactory and respiratory zone epithelium. In the same study, anatoxin-a was also administered with microcystin-LR intranasally, and synergistic effects were noted (Fitzgeorge et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">1994</CitationRef>).</Para>

          <Heading>Effect of Cyanobacterial Toxins on Wild Animals and Plants</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Cyanobacterial mass populations can have adverse effects on wildlife in addition to humans and domestic livestock (Codd <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">1995</CitationRef>; Carmichel <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">1997</CitationRef>; Falconer <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">1998</CitationRef>; Sivonen and Jones <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">1999</CitationRef>). A wide range of wild animals (mammals, amphibians, fish, invertebrates and birds) have been affected with consequences from nonfatal to fatal. Wild animal poisoning can occur after incidental ingestion of cyanobacterial biomass and toxins during drinking or feeding. In the case of fish, it is possible that additional exposure can occur via the gill surfaces. Cyanobacterial blooms containing Î¼g to mg per litre concentrations of cyanobacterial toxins pose health risks to adults and juveniles of aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates. Aquatic plants can take up microcystins at environmentally encountered concentrations. Phytoplanktonic birds have known to feed on cyanobacteria as a major or sole food source. Their pin plumage is a result of the ingestion of cyanobacterial pigments.</Para>

          <Heading>Multiple Fate of Cyanobacterial Toxins</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Cyanobacterial toxins undergo multiple fates after biosynthesis (Sivonen and Jones <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">1999</CitationRef>). These are not only of biological interest but of potential for the management of cyanobacterial toxin problems. When cyanobacterial cells are actively growing and healthy, the microcystin pools are mostly retained within the producer cells. However, with cylindrospermopsin, for example, even during growth, a large portion of the total pool may occur in external water. However, extracellular release of cyanobacterial toxins is accelerated during cell lysis, such as during natural bloom decay and in water treatment processes if these disrupt the cyanobacterial cells by physical or chemical action. Even when cyanobacterial toxins have been released, they can potentially persist for long periods. These small molecules are nonvolatile and relatively stable. Microcystins can withstand boiling and extremes of pH. However, in natural environments, they are subject to photodegradation by UV and visible light and biodegradation by a range of naturally occurring harmless bacteria.</Para>

          <Heading>Dose of Cyanobacterial Toxins</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Awareness of the properties and production of cyanobacteria and their toxins is a necessary part of risk management of cyanobacterial problem in the health, recreation, amenity, agriculture, aquaculture and drinking water supply (NRA <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">1990</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The risk management of cyanobacterial toxins includes reactive and proreactive measures (NRA <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">1990</CitationRef>; NSWBGATF <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">1992</CitationRef>; Yoo et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">1995</CitationRef>). Regarding reactive actions, the effectiveness of traditional and advanced drinking water treatment processes for the removal/destruction of cyanobacterial toxins is receiving attention with encouraging results for microcystins, anatoxin-a and cylindrospermopsin. The removal of cyanobacterial LPS (Rapala et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2002</CitationRef>) has been demonstrated with 59â97% reduction caused by conventional treatments such as coagulation, setting and sand filtration. Reactive measures include the formulations of decision-making systems, including emergency measures for access to and use of waterbodies in the event of cyanobacterial populations and toxins having developed to unacceptable concentrations (NRA <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">1990</CitationRef>; NSWBGATF <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">1992</CitationRef>; Yoo et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">1995</CitationRef>; Scottish Executive <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Proactive measures needed are basic knowledge of cyanobacterial toxin toxicity, production and persistence. This is necessary to permit the further confident derivative of drinking water GVs for additional toxins. Since policy development for cyanobacterial toxin risk management follows closely behind the primary research and developing awareness of the health significance and impacts of the toxins, it is necessary for effectiveness and suitability of action plans to be reviewed periodically and if necessary modified. This rolling approach is necessary modified.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Cyanobacterial toxins and their undesirable effects are being increasingly seen as part of the consequences of eutrophication (FWR <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2000</CitationRef>). Measures to reduce later, for example, restricting the excessive enrichment of water resources due to agricultural runoff and inadequately treated sewage now being addressed from local to catchment level, are seen as important longer-term actions which will contribute to cyanobacterial risk management.</Para>
