          <Para TextBreak="No">Fish species diversity is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and freshwater ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute the centre of diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate species on the Earth. Jawless fishes are the most primitive fish. There is current debate over whether these are really fish at all. They have no jaw, no scales, no paired fins and no bony skeleton. Their skin is smooth and soft to the touch, and they are very flexible. Instead of a jaw, they possess an oral sucker. They use this to fasten on to other fish and then use their rasp-like teeth to grind through their host’s skin into the viscera. Jawless fishes inhabit both fresh and salt water environments. Some are anadromous, moving between both fresh and salt water habitats. Extant jawless fishes are either lamprey or hagfish. Cartilaginous fishes have a cartilaginous skeleton. However, their ancestors were bony animals and were the first fish to develop paired fins. Cartilaginous fishes do not have swim bladders. Their skin is covered in placoid scales (dermal denticles) that are as rough as sandpaper. Bony fishes include the lobe-finned fish and the ray-finned fish. The lobe-finned fish is the class of fleshy-finned fishes, consisting of lungfish and coelacanths. They are bony fish with fleshy, lobed paired fins, which are joined to the body by a single bone. Teleosts are the most advanced or ‘modern’ fishes. They are overwhelmingly the dominant class of fishes (or for that matter, vertebrates) with nearly 30,000 species, covering about 96% of all extant fish species. They are ubiquitous throughout freshwater and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams. Included are nearly all the important commercial and recreational fishes.</Para>

          <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The term ‘fish’ most precisely describes any non-tetrapod craniate (i.e. an animal with a skull and in most cases a backbone) that has gills throughout life and whose limbs, if any, are in the shape of fins (Nelson <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">2006a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">b</CitationRef>). Unlike groupings such as birds or mammals, fishes are not a single clad but a paraphyletic collection of taxa, including hagfishes, lampreys, sharks and rays, ray-finned fish, coelacanths and lungfish (Helfman et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2009</CitationRef>). Indeed, lungfishes and coelacanths are closer relatives of tetrapods (such as mammals, birds, amphibians) than of other fish such as ray-finned fish or sharks, so the last common ancestor of all fish is also an ancestor to tetrapods. As paraphyletic groups are no longer recognised in modern systematic biology, the use of the term ‘fish’ as a biological group must be avoided. Many types of aquatic animals commonly referred to as ‘fish’ are not fish; examples include shellfish, cuttlefish, starfish, crayfish and jellyfish. In earlier times, even biologists did not make a distinction—sixteenth-century natural historians classified also seals, whales, amphibians, crocodiles, even hippopotamuses, as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates, as fish. However, all mammals, including cetaceans like whales and dolphins, are not fish. In some contexts, especially in aquaculture, the true fishes are referred to as finfish (or fin fish) to distinguish them from these other animals.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">A typical fish is ectothermic; has a streamlined body for rapid swimming; extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to breathe atmospheric oxygen; has two sets of paired fins, usually one or two (rarely three) dorsal fins, an anal fin and a tail fin; has jaws; has skin that is usually covered with scales; and lays eggs. Tuna, swordfish and some species of sharks show some warm-blooded adaptations—they can heat their bodies significantly above ambient water temperature. Streamlining and swimming performance varies from fish such as tuna, salmon and jacks that can cover 10–20 body-lengths per second to species such as eels and rays that swim no more than 0.5 body-lengths per second. Many groups of freshwater fish extract oxygen from the air as well as from the water using a variety of different structures. Lungfishes have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods, and gouramis have a structure called the labyrinth organ that performs a similar function, while many catfish, such as <Emphasis Type="Italic">Corydoras</Emphasis>, extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach. Body shape and the arrangement of the fins are highly variable, covering such seemingly un-fishlike forms as seahorses, pufferfish, anglerfish and gulpers. Similarly, the surface of the skin may be naked or covered with scales of a variety of different types usually defined as placoid (typical of sharks and rays), cosmoid (fossil lungfish and coelacanths), ganoid, cycloid and ctenoid (last two are found on most bony fish). There are even fish that live mostly on land. Mudskippers feed and interact with one another on mudflats and go underwater to hide in their burrows. The catfish <Emphasis Type="Italic">Phreatobius cisternarum</Emphasis> lives in underground, phreatic habitats, and its relative lives in waterlogged leaf litter. Fish range in size from the huge 16-m whale shark to the tiny 8-mm stout infant fish.</Para>

It is complex and still evolving (Nelson <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">2006a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">b</CitationRef>). Controversies over ‘arcane, but important, details of classification are still quietly raging’. The term ‘fish’ describes any non-tetrapod chordate (i.e. an animal with a backbone) that has gills throughout life and has limbs, if any, in the shape of fins (Nelson <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">2006a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">b</CitationRef>).

Some are anadromous, moving between both fresh and salt water habitats. Extant jawless fishes are either lamprey or hagfish. Juvenile lamprey feed by sucking up mud containing microorganisms and organic debris. The lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. The hagfish coats itself and carcasses, it finds with noxious slime to deter predators, and periodically ties itself into a knot to scrape the slime off. It is the only invertebrate fish and the only animal which has a skull but no vertebral column (Campbell and Reece <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2005</CitationRef>). It has four hearts, two brains and a paddle-like tail (Aird <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>

Cartilaginous fishes do not have swim bladders. Their skin is covered with placoid scales (dermal denticles) that are as rough as sandpaper. Because cartilaginous fishes do not have bone marrow, the spleen and special tissue around the gonads produce red blood cells. Their tails can be asymmetric, with the upper lobe longer than the lower lobe. Some cartilaginous fishes possess an organ called Leydig’s organ which also produces red blood cells. There are over 980 species of cartilaginous fish. They include sharks, rays and chimaera.</Para>

In this class are included all the important commercial and recreational fishes (Encyclopaedia <CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Teleosts have a movable maxilla and premaxilla, and corresponding modifications in the jaw musculature occur. These modifications make it possible for teleosts to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. The caudal fin is homocercal, meaning the upper and lower lobes are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from those in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the caudal fin (Benton <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">1990</CitationRef>).</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">The smallest fish species is <Emphasis Type="Italic">Paedocypris progenetica</Emphasis>, a type of minnow which lives in the dark-coloured peat swamps of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The females of this species have a standard length of 7.9 mm (0.31 in) at maturity. Until recently, this was the smallest of all known vertebrates. However, recently a minute Papua New Guinea frog, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Paedophryne amauensis</Emphasis>, with a standard length of 7.7 mm (0.30 in) was discovered (Tamare <CitationRef CitationID="CR46">2012</CitationRef>). The slender Indonesian fish may still be the smallest vertebrate by weight. Male individuals of the anglerfish species <Emphasis Type="Italic">Photocorynus spiniceps</Emphasis> are 6.2–7.3 mm long at maturity, and thus could be claimed as an even smaller species. However, these males do not survive on their own merits but only by sexual parasitism on the larger female (Ronald <CitationRef CitationID="CR42">2006</CitationRef>). Another very small fish is the stout infant fish, a type of goby. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the sinarapan, also a goby, is the world’s smallest commercially harvested fish (Foot <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2000</CitationRef>). Found in the Philippines, they have an average length of 12.5 mm (0.49 in) and are threatened by overfishing (Froese and Pauly <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Some of the shortest-lived species are gobies, which are small coral reef-dwelling fish. Some of the longest-lived are rockfish. The shortest-lived fish is the seven-figure pygmy goby, which lives for at most 59 days. This is the shortest lifespan for any vertebrate (Depczynski and Bellwood <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2005</CitationRef>). Short-lived fishes have particular value in genetic studies on aging. In particular, the ram cichlid is used in laboratory studies because of its ease of breeding and predictable aging pattern (Herrera and Jagadeeswaran <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">2004</CitationRef>; Froese and Pauly <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2009</CitationRef>). The longest-lived fish is the rougheye rockfish <Emphasis Type="Italic">Sebastes aleutianus</Emphasis> (205 years), found offshore in the North Pacific at 25–900 m (14–490 fathoms). This fish exhibits negligible senescence. There are stories about Japanese koi goldfish passed from generation to generation for 300 years. Scientists are skeptical. Counting growth lines on the scales of fish confined to ponds or bowls is unreliable, since they lay down extra lines. The maximum reported age for a goldfish is 41 years.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The longest-living commercial fish may be orange, roughly with a maximum reported age of 149 years. One of the longest-living sport fish is the Atlantic tarpon, with a maximum reported age of 55 years. Some of the longest-living fish are living fossils, such as the green sturgeon. This species is among the longest-living species found in freshwater, with a maximum reported age of 60 years. They are also among the largest fish species found in freshwater, with a maximum reported length of 2.5 m. Another living fossil is the Australian lungfish. One individual has lived in an aquarium for 75 years and is the oldest fish in captivity. According to fossil records, the Australian lungfish has hardly changed for 380 million years. Among gobies, small coral reef-dwelling fishes are some of the shortest-lived fishes with the seven-figure pygmy goby living at most for 59 days.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">There is 10,000 times more saltwater in the oceans than there is freshwater in the lakes and rivers. However, only 58% of extant fish species are saltwater. A disproportionate 41% are freshwater fish (the remaining 1% are anadromous) (Cohen <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">1970</CitationRef>). This diversity in freshwater species is, perhaps, not surprising, since the thousands of separate lake habitats promote speciation.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Fish can also be demersal or pelagic. Demersal fishes live on or near the bottom of oceans and lakes, while pelagic fishes inhabit the water column away from the bottom. Habitats can also be vertically stratified. Epipelagic fishes occupy sunlit waters down to 200 m (110 fathoms), mesopelagic fish occupying deeper twilight waters down to 1,000 m (3,300 ft) and bathypelagic fish inhabiting the cold and pitch black depths below. Most oceanic species (78 or 44% of all fish species) live near the shoreline. These coastal fish live on or above the relatively shallow continental shelf. Only 13% of all fish species live in the open ocean, off the shelf. Of these, 1% are epipelagic, 5% are pelagic and 7% are deep water (Cohen <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">1970</CitationRef>). Fishes are found in nearly all natural aquatic environments (Cohen <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">1970</CitationRef>). Most fish, whether by species count or abundance, live in warmer environments with relatively stable temperatures. However, some species survive temperatures up to 44.6°C (112.3°F), while others cope with colder waters; there are over 200 finfish species south of the Antarctic Convergence. Some fish species tolerate salinities over 10% (Bone and Moore <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2008</CitationRef>). The world’s deepest living fish, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Abyssobrotula galatheae</Emphasis>, a species of cusk eel, lives in the Puerto Rico Trench at a depth of 8,372 m (27,467 ft) (Bone and Moore <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2008</CitationRef>; Froese and Pauly <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2009</CitationRef>). At the other extreme, the Tibetan stone loach lives at altitudes over 5,200 m (17,100 ft) in the Himalayas. Some marine pelagic fish range over vast areas, such as the blue shark that lives in all oceans. At the other extreme are fish confined to single, small living spaces, such as isolated cave fish like <Emphasis Type="Italic">Lucifuga</Emphasis> in the Bahamas and Cuba, or equally isolated desert pupfish living in small desert spring systems in Mexico and the southwest USA, or bythitid vent fish like <Emphasis Type="Italic">Thermichthys hollisi</Emphasis>, living around thermal vents 2,400 m (1,300 fathoms) down.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Grouper are protogynous hermaphrodites, who school in harems of 3–15 females. When no male is available, the most aggressive and largest females shift sex to male, probably as a result of behavioural triggers. In very deep waters, it is not easy for a fish to find a mate. There is no light, so some species depend on bioluminescence. Others are hermaphrodites, which doubles their chances of producing both eggs and sperm when an encounter does occur (Ryan <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">2007</CitationRef>). The female anglerfish releases pheromones to attract tiny males. When a male finds her, he bites on to her and never lets go. When a male of the anglerfish species <Emphasis Type="Italic">Haplophryne mollis</Emphasis> bites into the skin of a female, he releases an enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair to the point where the two circulatory systems join up. The male then atrophies into nothing more than a pair of gonads. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available (Pietsch <CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2009</CitationRef>). Some sharks, such as hammerheads are able to breed parthenogenetically.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Fishes adopt a variety of strategies for nurturing their brood. Sharks, for example, variously follow three protocols with their brood. Most sharks, including lamniformes (Froese and Pauly <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2006</CitationRef>) are ovoviviparous, bearing their young after they nourish themselves after hatching and before birth, by consuming the remnants of the yolk and other available nutrients. Some such as hammerheads are viviparous, bearing their young after nourishing hatchlings internally, analogously to mammalian gestation. Finally, catsharks and others are, oviparous, laying their eggs to hatch in the water. Some animals, predominantly fish such as cardinal fish practice mouth brooding, caring for their offspring by holding them in the mouth of a parent for extended periods of time. Mouth brooding has evolved independently in several different families of fish.</Para>

          <Heading>Early Fish</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Early fish lineages had inflexible jaws limited to little more than opening and closing. Modern teleosts have evolved protrusible jaws that can reach out to engulf prey (Liem <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">1980</CitationRef>; Lauder <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">1980</CitationRef>). An extreme example is the protrusible jaw of the slingjaw wrasse. Its mouth extends into a tube half as long as its body, and with a strong suction it catches prey. The equipment tucks away under its body when it is not in use (Froese and Pauly <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2009</CitationRef>; Bone and Moore <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2008</CitationRef>). In practice, feeding modes lie on a spectrum, with suction and ram feeding at the extremes. Many fish capture their prey using both suction pressures combined with a forward motion of the body or jaw (Norton and Bainerd <CitationRef CitationID="CR36">1993</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The cookiecutter shark is a small dogfish which derives its name from the way it removes small circular plugs, looking as though cut with a cookie cutter, from the flesh and skin of cetaceans and larger fish, including other sharks. The cookiecutter attaches to its larger prey with its suctorial lips and then protrudes its teeth to remove a symmetrical scoop of flesh. Most fishes are food opportunists or generalists. They eat whatever is most easily available. For example, the blue shark feeds on dead whales and nearly everything else that wriggles: other fish, cephalopods, gastropods, ascidians and crustaceans. Ocean sunfishes prefer jellyfish (Froese and Pauly <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Other fishes have developed extreme specialisations. Silver arowana, also called <Emphasis Type="Italic">monkey fish</Emphasis>, can leap 2 m out of the water to capture prey. They usually swim near the surface of the water waiting for potential prey. Their main diet consists of crustaceans, insects, smaller fishes and other animals that float on the water surface, for which their drawbridge-like mouth is exclusively adapted for feeding. The remains of small birds, bats and snakes have also been found in their stomachs (Froese and Pauly <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2009</CitationRef>). Archerfishes prey on land-based insects and other small animals by literally shooting them down with water droplets from their specialised mouths. Doctor fishes (<Emphasis Type="Italic">nibble fish</Emphasis>) live and breed in the outdoor pools of some Turkish spas, where they feed on the skin of patients with psoriasis. The fishes are like cleaner fish in that they only consume the affected and dead areas of the skin, leaving the healthy skin to recover.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Four-eyed fishes have eyes raised above the top of the head which is divided into two different parts, so that they can see below and above the water surface at the same time. Four-eyed fishes actually have only two eyes, but their eyes are specially adapted for their surface-dwelling lifestyle. The eyes are positioned on the top of the head, and the fish floats at the water surface with only the lower half of each eye underwater. The two halves are divided by a band of tissue and the eye has two pupils, connected by part of the iris. The upper half of the eye is adapted for vision in air, the lower half for vision in water (Nelson <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">2006</CitationRef>). The lens of the eye also changes in thickness top to bottom to account for the difference in the refractive indices of air versus water. These fishes spend most of their time at the surface of the water. Their diet mostly consists of the terrestrial insects which are available at the surface.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Many species of fish can see the ultraviolet end of the spectrum, beyond the violet (Jacobs <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">1992</CitationRef>). The two-stripe damselfish, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Dascyllus reticulatus</Emphasis>, has ultraviolet-reflecting colouration which they appear to use as an alarm signal to other fish of their species. Predatory species cannot see this if their vision is not sensitive to ultraviolet. There is further evidence for this view that some fish use ultraviolet as a ‘high-fidelity secret communication channel hidden from predators’, while yet other species use ultraviolet to make social or sexual signals. Mesopelagic fishes live in deeper waters, in the twilight zone down to depths of 1,000 m, where the amount of sunlight available is not sufficient to support photosynthesis. These fishes are adapted for an active life under low light conditions. Barrel eyes are a family of small, unusual-looking mesopelagic fishes, named for their barrel-shaped, tubular eyes which are generally directed upwards to detect the silhouettes of available prey (Robison and Reisenbichler <CitationRef CitationID="CR41">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>

The two-stripe damselfish can signal secret alarms by reflecting ultraviolet to other fish of its species. The barrel eye has barrel-shaped, telescopic eyes which are generally directed upwards, but can also be swirled forward. Flashlight fish uses a retroreflector behind the retina with photophores to detect eyeshine in other fish. Another mesopelagic fish is the flashlight fish. For more sensitive vision in low light, this fish has a retroreflector behind the retina. They also have photophores, which they use in combination with their retroreflector to detect eyeshine in other fish (Morin et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR33">1975</CitationRef>; McCosker <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">1977</CitationRef>).</Para>

Among the fastest sprinters are the Indo-Pacific sailfish and the black marlin. Both have been recorded in a burst at over 110 km per hour (68 mph). For the sailfish, that is equivalent to 12–15 times their own length per second. The wahoo is perhaps the fastest fish for its size, attaining a speed of 19 lengths per second, reaching 78 km per hour.</Para>

Sometimes in the struggle with a shark, a swordfish can kill it by ramming it in the gills or belly. This shark is highly migratory. Its exothermic constitution partly accounts for its relatively great speed (Passarelli et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2008</CitationRef>). The Atlantic bluefin tuna is capable of sustained high speed cruising and maintains high muscle temperatures so it can cruise in relatively cold waters. The slowest fishes are the seahorses, and the tiny dwarf seahorse is the slowest of all. One of the fastest sprinters is the Indo-Pacific sailfish.

                <Heading>By Toxicity</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Toxic fishes produce strong poisons in their bodies. Both poisonous fish and venomous fish contain toxins, but deliver them differently. Venomous fishes bite, sting or stab, causing an envenomation. Venomous fishes do not necessarily cause poisoning if they are eaten, since the digestive system often destroys the venom. By contrast, the digestive system does not destroy poisonous fish toxins, making them poisonous to eat. The most poisonous fish is the puffer fish. It is the second-most poisonous vertebrate after the golden dart frog. It paralyses the diaphragm muscles of human victims, who can die from suffocation. In Japan, skilled chefs use parts of a closely related species, the blowfish to create a delicacy called ‘fugu’, including just enough toxin for that ‘special flavour’. The spotted trunkfish is a reef fish which secretes a colourless ciguatera toxin from glands on its skin when touched. The toxin is only dangerous when ingested, so there is no immediate harm to divers. However, predators as large as nurse sharks can die as a result of eating a trunkfish (Froese and Pauly <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2009</CitationRef>). The giant moray is a reef fish at the top of the food chain. Like many other apex reef fish, it is likely to cause ciguatera poisoning if eaten. Outbreaks of ciguatera poisoning in the eleventh to fifteenth centuries from large, carnivorous reef fish, caused by harmful algal blooms, could be a reason why Polynesians migrated to Easter Island, New Zealand and possibly Hawaii (Rongo et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">2009</CitationRef>). The puffer fish is the most poisonous fish in the world. The spotted trunkfish secretes a ciguatera toxin from glands on its skin. Like many other apex reef fish, the giant moray can cause ciguatera poisoning if eaten. A 2006 study found that there are at least 1,200 species of venomous fish (Smith and Wheeler <CitationRef CitationID="CR45">2006</CitationRef>). There are more venomous fish than venomous snakes. In fact, there are more venomous fish than the combined total of all other venomous vertebrates. Venomous fishes are found in almost all habitats around the world, but mostly in tropical waters. They wound over 50,000 people every year. They carry their venom in venom glands and use various delivery systems, such as spines or sharp fins, barbs, spikes and fangs. Venomous fishes tend to be either very visible, using flamboyant colours to warn enemies, or skilfully camouflaged and maybe buried in the sand. Apart from the defence or hunting value, venom helps bottom-dwelling fish by killing the bacteria that try to invade their skin. The most venomous known fish is the reef stonefish (Froese and Pauly <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2009</CitationRef>). It has a remarkable ability to camouflage itself among rocks. It is an ambush predator that sits on the bottom waiting for prey to approach. Instead of swimming away if disturbed, it erects 13 venomous spines along its back. For defence, it can shoot venom from each or all of these spines. Each spine is like a hypodermic needle, delivering the venom from two sacs attached to the spine. The stonefish has control over whether to shoot its venom, and does so when provoked or frightened (Grady <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2006</CitationRef>). The venom results in severe pain, paralysis and tissue death and can be fatal if not treated. Despite its formidable defences, stonefishes have predators. Some bottom-feeding rays and sharks with crushing teeth feed on them, as does the Stokes’ seasnake.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Unlike stonefish, lionfish can only release venom when something strikes its spines. The stargazer buries itself and can deliver electric shocks as well as venom. It is a delicacy in some cultures (cooking destroys the venom) and can be found for sale in some fish markets with the electric organ removed. They have been called ‘the meanest things in creation’(Grady <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">Fishes are sought by humans for their value as commercial food fish, recreational sport fish, decorative aquarium fish and, in tourism, attracting snorkelers and scuba divers. Throughout human history, important fisheries have been based on forage fish. Forage fishes are small fish which are eaten by larger predators. They usually school together for protection. Typical ocean forage fishes feed near the bottom of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, menhaden, hilsa, shad and sprats), as well as anchovies, capelin and halfbeaks. Important herring fisheries have existed for centuries in the North Atlantic and the North Sea. Likewise, important tradition for anchovy and sardine fisheries has operated in the Pacific, the Mediterranean and the southeast Atlantic (Bone and Moore <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2008</CitationRef>). The world annual catch of forage fish in recent years has been around 25 million tonnes, or one quarter of the world’s total catch.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Higher in the food chain, Gadidae (cod, pollock, haddock, saithe, hake and whiting) also support important fisheries. Concentrated initially in the North Sea, Atlantic cod was one of Europe’s oldest fisheries, later extending to the Grand Banks. Declining numbers led to international ‘cod wars’ and eventually the virtual abandonment of these fisheries. These days the Alaska pollock supports an important fishery in the Bering Sea and the north Pacific, yielding about six million tonnes, while cod amounts to about nine million tonnes (Bone and Moore <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2008</CitationRef>). Yellowfin tuna are now being fished as a replacement for the depleted Southern bluefin tuna.</Para>
