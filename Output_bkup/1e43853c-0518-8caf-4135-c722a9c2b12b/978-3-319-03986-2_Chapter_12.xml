          <Para TextBreak="No">This chapter presents some selected major health concerns in Africa with a focus on their sociological dimensions. The chapter proceeds with the explanation of the social correlates of malaria. Critical issues include the influence of poor environmental conditions, poverty, misconceptions about malaria, and limited access to preventive and treatment measures. The chapter discusses sociocultural factors in the spread of HIV/AIDS as it is noted that they play a dominant role in the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Africa. Some of the factors discussed include gender, polygyny, early marriage and non-consensus union, traditional beliefs and healing practices, stigma, and harmful cultural practices (e.g., widowhood rites, scarification, and female genital cutting). The state of maternal and child health is examined, stressing that Africa still bears the brunt of the problem because of poor structural indicators. The presentation of a community approach to health care for developing societies is to invoke more discussion about community engagement that can alleviate the burden of disease, especially in Africa. This chapter has links (through cross-referencing) to concepts and theoretical stances discussed in previous chapters, thereby creating a reflective interpretation of conceptual issues in line with some practical realities.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Malaria<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Malaria</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is a major population health challenge in Africa. Like other diseases, there are a number of social correlates of malaria. Malaria is a life-threatening parasitic disease. Malaria, or “ague” as it is otherwise known, has a very long history. The word “malaria” comes from an Italian phrase “mal aria,” and it literally means “bad air” (MacArthur <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">1952</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>MacAuthor, W.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. The earliest description of malaria as a human disease is found in a document prepared by the Emperor Huang around 2,700 <Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">BC</Emphasis> (Wellcome <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">2002</CitationRef>). However, Hippocrates<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Hippocrates</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> (460–370 <Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">BC</Emphasis>) is acclaimed as the first malariologist because he classified the fever now known to be malaria. After the recognition of the malaria parasite by Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran (1845–1922) in 1800, some scientists including Patrick Manson (1844–1922), a Scottish medical doctor and Ronald Ross (1857–1932) suspected mosquitoes as the malaria vector (Wellcome <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">2002</CitationRef>). Later, Ronald Ross (1857–1932) worked on the lifecycle of malaria and submitted that an infected mosquito could transmit it (Wellcome <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The vector of malaria is the female anopheles mosquito<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Anopheles mosquitoes</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, which sucks human blood to facilitate its egg production. Therefore, the mode of transmission is through the bite of an anopheles mosquito. Malaria takes the lives of up to 700,000 people per year, 90 % of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, and causes about 300 million people to fall ill (WHO <CitationRef CitationID="CR49">2012a</CitationRef>). It is important to note, however, that the under-five children are the most vulnerable malaria risk group. Generally, everyone (children and adults) living in malaria-endemic areas are at risk of malaria. However, 85 % of malaria-related deaths occur among under-five children, who have not yet acquired the semi-immunity which adults residing in endemic areas may have developed.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The human malaria infection is caused by four different species of protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium: <Emphasis Type="Italic">Plasmodium Falciparum</Emphasis>,<Emphasis Type="Italic"> Plasmodium vivax</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Plasmodium ovale</Emphasis>, and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Plasmodium malariae</Emphasis> (Wellcome <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">2002</CitationRef>). <Emphasis Type="Italic">Falciparum</Emphasis>

              <Primary>Falciparum</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is the most dangerous and toxic of the family. It is further observed that <Emphasis Type="Italic">P. Falciparum</Emphasis> migrated with Africans to other parts of the world (Wellcome <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">2002</CitationRef>). It was further reported that until the 19th century, malaria was not found in Northern Europe, North America, and Russia, but transmission in Southern Europe was intense, while Africa, especially SSA, excluding South Africa<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>South Africa</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, is malaria-endemic.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Since malaria is usually perceived and defined through its symptoms and signs, it therefore becomes highly pertinent to discuss the manifestation of this deadly disease. Malaria is classified into two major clinical types. The first classification of malaria is referred to as simple, uncomplicated, moderate, or non-severe type, otherwise known as mild malaria. Symptoms of mild malaria include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, cough, chills, muscle pains, and lassitude. Mild malaria might develop into complicated or severe malaria, which is life-threatening. It is important to note that malaria has symptom complex, implying that some of its signs and symptoms could also be attributed to other ailments. Since mild malaria usually presents with fever, in malaria-endemic countries like Africa, most episodes of fever are treated as malaria cases, especially because of inadequate diagnostic kits. Therefore, diagnosis is often presumptive in nature, based on the signs and symptoms perceived. In some cases, there could be misdiagnosis because of the symptom complexity of malaria.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The WHO (<CitationRef CitationID="CR45">2008a</CitationRef>) reported that <Emphasis Type="Italic">Plasmodium falciparum</Emphasis> malaria is usually very severe and is responsible for most of the cases of malaria-related death. The inability of most people to take swift action in the case of a severe malaria attack could mean a fatal consequence within 48 h of the onset of illness. This is why procrastination<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Procrastination</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> of treatment is dangerous. Accordingly, one of the Roll Back Malaria (RBM)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Roll Back Malaria (RBM)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> objectives at the community level is to improve prompt recognition of malaria by caregivers and to assist them in taking effective action within 24 h of the onset of illness.</Para>

              <Primary>Poverty</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> or underdevelopment. Mosquitoes usually breed in poorly planned neighborhoods. Because of the poor housing facilities, there might be poor sanitation systems resulting in water logging, which serves as a breeding site for mosquitoes. Most windows and doors might not be screened to prevent mosquitoes from entering the homes. The poor usually have little or no access to information and education about public health. They might not have basic knowledge of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> or available drugs. Most of the available treatment and preventive measures may also not be affordable to them.</Para>

            <Heading>Community Understanding of Malaria</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In Africa, there are various cultural explanations of malaria which are divergent from the biomedical explanations. Such explanations involve cultural constructions informed by the prevailing beliefs and knowledge about malaria. Heggenhougen et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2003</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Heggenhougen, H.K.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> observed that the perception of malaria may vary by culture, shaped by such factors as educational level, social status, religious beliefs, and location (urban or rural). Understanding these local notions of malaria is crucial in malaria control. This is why Heggenhougen et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2003</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Heggenhougen, H.K.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> further noted that malaria control efforts should consider multidimensional human contexts that create and support varying notions of malaria because of their profound consequence for prevention, treatment, and control. The notion is often understood by examining the perceived causes, modes of transmission, symptoms, vulnerability<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Vulnerability</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>, and other related beliefs about malaria. Many local communities still hold a number of misconceptions which are detrimental to control efforts (Amzat <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Amzat, J.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. There is attribution of malaria to incorrect etiologic agents such as dust, heat, palm oil, stress, evil spirits, and other mystical factors. This causal attribution is not peculiar to malaria; it forms a part of the general disease explanation in many African communities (see Sect. <ExternalRef>
                <RefSource>2.7</RefSource>

).</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Adera (<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2003</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Adera, T.D.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>, in a study conducted in Ethiopia<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Ethiopia</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>, reported misconceptions of the mode of malaria transmission as respondents mentioned dirt, nature, mud, and water. Similarly, Comoro et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2003</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Comoro, C.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> reported that in some parts of Tanzania<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Tanzania</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>, the common perceived cause of <Emphasis Type="Italic">degedege</Emphasis> (local concept for malaria) among the under-five children was an evil spirit. Hence urinating on the child who suffers from <Emphasis Type="Italic">degedege</Emphasis> and fuming him/her with elephant dung are the usual traditional remedies. If the mode of transmission of malaria is well understood at the community level, it will help to promote the use of appropriate preventive measures. Unfortunately, some mothers of under-fives and pregnant women (who are the most vulnerable) do not understand the mode of transmission of malaria (Amzat and Omololu <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2009</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Amzat, J.</Primary>

                <Primary>Omololu, O.F.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Due to wrong causal perceptions, the perceived mode of transmission is still misconceived, thereby attributing it to cuddling and other forms of physical contact (Jegede et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2005</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Jegede, A.S.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Understanding the human context and general cultural milieu in relation to malaria would direct intervention at the community level.</Para>

            <Heading>Malaria Prevention and Treatment</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The control of mosquito breeding sites is still poor in many African communities. For instance, Opiyo et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">2007</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Opiyo, P.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>, in a study in Kenya<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Kenya</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>, found that despite knowledge that the removal of water containing borrow pits controls mosquitoes breeding, most community members do not translate such knowledge into action. One major step in malaria control is environmental sanitation to curtail the breeding of mosquitoes. Moreover, the use of ITNs<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs)</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> is a major preventive measure; it helps to avoid contacts with mosquitoes. The consistently high prevalence of malaria in SSA signifies that there is still low usage of preventive measures. An increase in the use of preventive measures would reduce morbidity and mortality due to malaria. In 2000 the ITN was launched in Abuja, Nigeria (the goals set often referred to as the Abuja target). It was projected that there would be considerable ITN coverage (of 60 % in 2005) of pregnant women and under-five children. The use of ITNs is still generally low as no nation in SSA met the Abuja target. Opiyo et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">2007</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Opiyo, P.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> observed that most people have adequate theoretical knowledge of how to prevent malaria but with a gap between theoretical knowledge and practical household malaria prevention.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">A considerable percentage of households in SSA do not own ITNs despite harbouring pregnant women and under-five children who are most vulnerable to malaria.

Globally, 34 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2011 (UNAID <CitationRef CitationID="CR40">2012a</CitationRef>).

Despite the progress made, new infections continue to occur, but at a declining rate; there was more than a 50 % reduction among adults (15–49 years) in many countries between 2001 and 2011 (UNAIDS <CitationRef CitationID="CR41">2012b</CitationRef>).

              </IndexTerm> to HIV infection. In SSA, six out of ten people living with HIV/AIDS are women. Young women are partly at higher risk of sexual violence because of their economic dependence on men (Amzat <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2010</CitationRef>:4)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            <Para TextBreak="No">In African contexts, gender norms that are related to femininity can prevent young women from accessing HIV information and services (WHO <CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2009</CitationRef>). In most cultures in Africa, young girls are supposed to maintain modesty and are not generally permitted to discuss sexualities in the open. The cultures of shyness and silence are socially prescribed and enforced. Norms of femininity prescribes submissiveness to the male partner. Hence it is often considered a cultural and moral aberration for a wife to discuss sexuality<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Sexuality</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> or negotiate sexual issues with her partner. In general, women have limited decision-making power in all household matters. This social passiveness within the household is responsible for women’s low status in the community. Women’s social relevance is marked by domestic and reproductive roles. Gender norms related to masculinity can encourage men to have more sexual partners and older men to have sexual relations with much younger women (WHO <CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2009</CitationRef>). The “sugar daddy syndrome” is a typical illustration whereby older rich men have sexual relations with young ladies mostly in exchange for material benefits. While such a syndrome exposes men to HIV, it puts young girls at even more risk. The syndrome creates a sexual network<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Sexual network</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> of many individuals who are unknown to each other. The spiral could expand to the point in which an individual in the network gets infected and spells a common destiny of HIV to all members of the network, unless preventive measures are effectively utilised.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">HIV-related stigma is directly detrimental to PLWHA. They often lose community support, individuals may be isolated within their family, or deprived of social goods (housing, employment, and opportunities) required for general well-being (Rankin et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">2005</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

For instance, country-level surveys conducted in a number of African countries indicated that PLHWA face barriers to employment, including discrimination in hiring, loss of promotions, and employment termination because of HIV status (Sprague et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Sprague, L.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Discrimination often leads to the development of internal stigma among the PLWHA, thereby causing these people to view themselves as persons doomed to die soon, without hope of life, and a waste to self and society. The major consequences are poor quality of life and accelerated physiological breakdown or death.</Para>

                <Primary>Sexual behaviour</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. In Africa, a majority of the population is very religious, and expression of sexuality<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Sexuality</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> is bound by strict religious values. Such values restrict sexuality education among the underaged in schools and open discourse about sexual matters. The values often promote the culture of silence<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Culture of silence</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> and shyness about sexual issues as a form of sexual modesty. Despite the religious myths surrounding sexuality, the level of conformity with religious sexual regulation is often low in many communities. This implies that the gap between the religious ideals and social reality is wide, and the reality is sometimes denied because everyone wants to appear modest. For instance, Islam<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            <Para TextBreak="No">It has also been documented that some girls engage in unprotected anal sex to maintain their virginity or have to be married off earlier so that their partners would meet them as virgins.

            <Para TextBreak="No">The first major challenge regarding HIV in Africa was the scepticism about the reality of the disease (Amzat <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2010</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Amzat, J.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Many Africans first thought that it was a western conspiracy or that the disease was not real. By the time there was improved knowledge about the reality of HIV, millions of people had already been infected and affected. Then, there were growing misconceptions about the causes and prevention of HIV, especially among those with low level of formal education and little or no access to relevant information on HIV and sexuality. This accounted for a low initial perception of risk factors. The situation is still evident in many rural communities.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">More so, the cultural patterns of sexual relations in some African communities also fuel the problem of HIV. Among the rural Maasai and Nuer<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Heading>Girl-child beading in Kenya</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The practice of “beading” is common among some communities in Samburu and Rendille communities in Kenya. It involves a man (often a relative) buying a beaded necklace, but could include wrist or waist beads for a girl as a sign of sexual engagement. Beading implies a commencement of a community-sanctioned, non-marital sexual relationship between men especially in the “warrior” age group (called the morans) and unmarried girls. Generally, beading is used as adornment but for some communities it also connotes sexual enslavement. The females are often divided into groups: girls, married women, and elderly women. The communities are largely pastoral and semi-nomadic. Most girls perform domestic duties including caring for livestock. Female circumcision (usually performed in a non-clinical setting) is culturally prescribed for girls to prepare them for marriage. The process of beading begins with negotiations between a man and the girlʼs parents (the girlʼs choice is violated). Following a mutual agreement between a man and the girlʼs parents, the girl’s mother builds a hut for the girl, where she can be accessed for sex. Girls may be as young as eight years old when they are beaded. Since the sexual relationships often take place within a clan, it is a form of incestuous practice. Therefore, it does not lead to marriage and pregnancy is forbidden despite the non-use of preventive measures. When pregnancies do result, beaded girls may be forced to have a crude abortion (usually a forced miscarriage performed by older women) or to give up the newborn for infanticide or for adoption by a stranger in another community (one of the options is mandatory according to the culture). In some cases, other members of the manʼs age grade may also have sexual access to his beaded girl. The sexual risk of HIV is enormous: the girlsʼ age at sexual debut is usually low, the men are usually older with many sexual experiences, and multiple sexual accesses by a number of men could be permitted. Apart from the risk of HIV, the beading practice is a culture of incest, sexual assault, abortion, and infanticide. While the Kenyan constitution does not permit infanticide and sexual assaults or relations with the underage, the extreme culture still persists in several rural communities.</Para>

Home births are more common in rural areas (77 %) than urban areas (57 %); only 42 % of births are delivered by a skilled provider while another 45 % are assisted by a traditional birth attendant and 9 % by untrained relatives or friends (SSL and ICF Macro <CitationRef CitationID="CR38">2009</CitationRef>). In Ghana<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

In Nigeria, the 2008 DHS showed that up to 58 % of pregnant women received some ANC from skilled providers; however, only 39 % of births were assisted by skilled birth attendants (SBAs) (NPC and ICF Macro <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">2009</CitationRef>).

              </IndexTerm> that comes too early, too often, and too late. There is still a high value being placed on large family size in most African communities, hence women tend to bear many children. The frequency of birth does not only increase the risk of maternal complications but it could account for a low household carrying capacity which will lead to low levels of care for children.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In many African communities, the age of first marriage is relatively low. Early pregnancy, especially before the age of 18, is associated with pregnancy-related complications. There is still a substantially high level of child marriage due to some cultural and religious reasons. Childbearing at a tender age (as low as age 12) in many societies not only increases the possibility of complications during birth but also questions the preparedness of the child-mother for childcare.

          <Para TextBreak="No">From the foregoing examination of health problems in Africa, it is evident that health challenges are entangled in a web of social correlates coupled with limited resources to meet the health needs<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Health needs</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> of the citizens. Community engagement (CE)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Community engagement (CE)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> should constitute a major tool for the PHC workers. Therefore, a community-centered approach in health care intervention could be effective in addressing the health needs of the people, especially in rural areas where the burden of disease is greatly felt. Invariably, strengthening the PHC system requires a community- or people-centered approach. Moreover, PHC efforts to tackle determinants of local ill-health can only be achieved through a community-centered approach. While it should be acknowledged that the CE approach/intervention is not new, this is to stress a need for intensified efforts and to propose a more inclusive approach for health intervention. The approach can capitalise on social solidarity<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Solidarity</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> to ensure an appropriate response to community health needs. Principally, the PHC system should utilise the CE approach to deliver better health services to the community. PHC should balance preventive and curative care. This is why the WHO<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>World Health Organization (WHO)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> (<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">2008b</CitationRef>, p. 41) stressed that primary care<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Primary care</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> should bring health “promotion and prevention, cure and care together in a safe, effective and socially productive way at the interface between the population and the health system.” This can only be achieved if there are practical measures to penetrate the communities and mobilise them to achieve set health priorities (WHO <CitationRef CitationID="CR46">2008b</CitationRef>).</Para>

Generally, CE involves the application of collective vision for the benefit of the people by building grassroots movement and structures involving community members for actualisation of set goals. CE involves a number of systematic processes of mobilisation emanating from the participatory rapid appraisal approach—social action of the community, by the community (members), and for the community. With regard to population health, it requires sustainable, coordinated activities with the use of manageable and sustainable strategies.

            <Heading>Developing and Supporting Local Health Volunteers</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Due to limited resources available to organise effective health care, sustainable measures at the community level will help to alleviate the burden of disease. It has previously been observed that in Africa, the number of health workers is extremely insufficient in alleviating the burden of disease (see Sect. <ExternalRef>
                <RefSource>10.3.6</RefSource>
                <RefTarget Address="10.1007/978-3-319-03986-2_10#Sec32" TargetType="DOI"/>
              </ExternalRef>). There are many rural communities without any health posts or medical personnel. In such scenarios, it is important to encourage community members to volunteer in addressing their community health needs<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Health needs</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. This could be done by educating and training a number of people in the community on basic health needs. The most important of such training should involve the dissemination of heath information. This will correct some misconceptions about specific diseases. It will also enhance the knowledge of risk factors and basic preventive and treatment measures. The WHO (<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">2008b</CitationRef>, p. 36) observed that “the mobilization of groups and communities to address what they consider to be their most important health problems and health-related inequalities is a necessary complement to the more technocratic and top-down approach to assessing social inequalities and determining priorities for action.” One major way this can be done is through local health volunteers.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Volunteering should be undertaken as a humanitarian duty—to serve as a way of contributing to community health and development. In places where there are community development associations, health committees should be developed. This could lead to the development of community “experts” who could play advisory roles on health-related issues or to provide basic medical responses such as giving preventive tips or ensuring appropriate referrals. Generally, community volunteerism is the bedrock of the CE approach, but it can only be achieved when there is an appropriate link to the primary health workers, especially at the primary care centers. Volunteerism ensures that certain individuals take up community roles of passing knowledge to others and provide supportive measures in case of health needs or emergencies<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The CHVs can serve as a reference group for all health-related matters. The CHVs who are well-trained could serve as links between health facilities and the community. While this will further promote a sense of community, it is also a way of self-defining strategies with the use of minimal resources. Since health problems are internally obvious in the community, a push to make a difference might evolve through the implementation of research focusing on community strategies to addressing their own problems.</Para>

              </IndexTerm> including emergencies (WHO <CitationRef CitationID="CR46">2008b</CitationRef>). Apart from volunteerism and health education<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Health education</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>, the development of community health structures is also a fundamental aspect of the CE approach. The structure may include the formation of groups of volunteers who will coordinate some health-related services such as community saving/donation, blood donation, emergency transport, and health guest schemes. Community saving could serve as a means of raising money to cater to those in need and in the case of an emergency. It is often difficult for some community members to pay for certain health services because such services are expensive; contributory donations could be a last resort in many circumstances. Community groups could form a blood donor scheme to help in many instances in which a patient requires blood, especially in birth delivery when the mother requires blood. Many communities have to travel more that 5 kilometers to access a health facility. Many community members do not have access to a vehicle. Therefore, organising an emergency transport scheme consisting of individuals who can drive and have access to a vehicle in the community can help to save a lot of lives.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">These community health structures have been a vital component of the CE approach implemented by a number of NGOs in SSA (see PATH <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2010</CitationRef>).

Invariably, enhancing the community structures is a major way of strengthening linkages for social support<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                <Primary>Mobile clinics</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Unfortunately, many communities in Africa still do not have physical access to health facilities. This is why it is advocated here that basic health posts could be provided as outposts of nearby primary health care centers. The WHO<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> (<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">2008b</CitationRef>:53) specifically noted that another strategy in primary care<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Primary care</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> is by “bringing care closer to people, in settings in close proximity and direct relationship with the community, relocating the entry point to the health system from hospitals and specialists to close-to-client generalist primary-care centres.” The health posts could serve as a meeting point for health-related matters and house mobile health officials where available. The provision of basic health posts or mobile clinics<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Mobile clinics</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> should also be prioritised to enhance home-based care<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> and appropriate referrals. The idea of mobile health might not necessarily be with the use of specialised or sophisticated ambulance/vehicles but by using motorcycles and bicycles. The use of mobile clinics has also proven effective in a number of communities in Ghana<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>. The WHO (<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">2008b</CitationRef>) acknowledged that more health benefits accrue when health workers operate more often in the community (i.e., outside the four walls of their consultation room).</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In general, the CE approach is based on community efforts but requires mobilisation. Some of the outcomes include the saturation of the community with health information through the use of CHVs to enhance social approval, address misconceptions and increase health care demand. It is in terms of mobilisation that political will is required on the part of the government for some investment in CE to improve population health. The approach is imbued with value for money because of a number of unpaid community volunteering and simple technologies<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Technologies</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. It has been noted that the CE approach is not new; a number of NGOs and international organisations have implemented the approach to improve community health, and it is sometimes abandoned after the expiration of implementation research. The sustainability of the approach often requires community support in terms of training and basic resources (e.g., drugs). Therefore, there is a need to scale up the CE approach; the approach needs to be adopted by local administrations and incorporated as a tool in the PHC system to address community health needs.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In sum, the challenge of improving population health, especially in developing countries, still remains a challenge yet to be fully resolved. Some progress has been made over the years, but more efforts are constantly needed to avert the huge burden of morbidity and mortality. Medical sociology holds a significant promise to address the social dimension of human health. This dimension is very vital if the goal of considerable reduction of disease burden must be achieved, not only in Africa but also all over the world.</Para>
