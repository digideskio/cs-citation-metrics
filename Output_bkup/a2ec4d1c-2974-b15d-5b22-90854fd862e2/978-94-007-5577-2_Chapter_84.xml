              <Para>The current study proposes a novel approach for the multi-model ensemble to be applied in air pollution forecasting. The methodology is based on decomposition of air pollution time series on different components (short-term, daily fluctuations, synoptic scale, etc.) and calibration of the ensemble for each of these components independently taking into account the performance of individual predictors. Therefore, the same model may have a different contribution for the ensemble at high and low frequency fluctuations. The Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) low-pass filter is used for the time series decomposition. The Fourier analysis is implemented to determine the contribution of different frequencies to the data variance allowing better understanding of the model performance and to define the ensemble weights. The methodology was tested using a group of four different air quality models that were applied over mainland Portugal for the 2006 year, and for main pollutants like O<Subscript>3</Subscript> and PM10. The approach implemented in this work was compared with one of the most used ensemble technique showing clear advantages.</Para>

              <Para>Ensemble modelling, originally developed for weather prediction, is being extended to air quality modelling applications demonstrating the advantage of deterministic ensemble compared with simulations provided by individual models (e.g. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00846">6</CitationRef>]). Nevertheless, they are still facing several problems. Furthermore, the mean and median ensembles as well as more advanced and complex ensemble techniques using multiple linear regression, Kalman filtering or Bayesian Model Averaging BMA approach have already been applied to improve the ensemble by specifying weights for members of the ensemble of models [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00842">2</CitationRef>]. These techniques can be time-resolving (weights are not function of time and only vary in space) or time function.</Para>
              <Para>The purpose of this work is to develop a new ensemble approach, based on decomposition of air pollution time series on different components and on the calibration of the ensemble for each of these components independently taking into account the performance of the individual predictors. This novel approach is compared with one of the most used mean ensemble technique.</Para>

              <Para>Spectral analysis is used to characterise time series in the frequency domain [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00841">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00844">4</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00845">5</CitationRef>]. Based on the Fourier series, this method allows to determine the contribution of different frequencies to the data variance and hence to analyse the contribution of various underling processes to the concentration fluctuations. The application of the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter allows decomposing the original time series on different components [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00843">3</CitationRef>]. In this work the KZ filter was designed taking into account information provided by the spectral analysis. Thus, separation frequencies are defined in order to separate between the baseline and short-term fluctuations (KZ<Subscript>3,5</Subscript>), daily (KZ<Subscript>5,5</Subscript>) and synoptic (KZ<Subscript>31.5</Subscript>) components (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00841">84.1</InternalRef>). <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00841">

The ensemble methodology was tested using four different air quality models: CAMx, CHIMERE; EURAD-IM and TAPM [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00842">2</CitationRef>]. All models are regional-scale models designed for short-term and long-term simulations of oxidants and aerosol formation, besides different degrees of complexity.

              <Para>Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig00842">84.2</InternalRef> presents the comparison between the model ensemble and observations for higher frequencies at one of the monitoring sites (REB). The correspondence between both terms is very satisfactory, which means that the model ensemble is able to reproduce the intra-diurnal, diurnal and synoptic fluctuations (in this case the period of fluctuations is less than 6 days) of the O<Subscript>3</Subscript> concentrations. These results are consistent over all the monitoring sites analysed. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00842">

Similar results were found for others monitoring sites, showing that the low frequencies are deficiently simulated, with high deviations exhibited by all the models analysed. Therefore, the performance of final ensemble is affected by the systematic errors presented in the baseline. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00843">

              <Para>The ensemble methodology proposed in this work is based on spectral analysis and decomposition of time series on different components and calibration of the ensemble for each of these components. This approach allows a better understanding of the models performance: the high frequencies fluctuations are well reproduced by the majority of the models while high biases are detected for the low frequencies (baseline term). In terms of the calibration of the ensemble, this novel approach shows to be successful when compared with a traditional mean ensemble technique in terms of improving correlation and reducing RMSE. The low frequencies (baseline) should be the focus of future research work in order to improve the models performance.</Para>

              </Heading>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Questioner Name</Emphasis>: Nicholas Savage</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: For use as a forecasting tool you need to use past data to get forecast. Have you tried doing this and how much memory do you think these weights have?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: Application of this technique to the operational forecast will be implemented as a next step. Taking into account that the methodology presented in this work is based on harmonic functions we expect a good “memory” of the weights for all the components (e.g. daily, synoptic, baseline) with possible exception for the highest frequencies.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Questioner Name</Emphasis>: Efisio Solazzo</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: Have you done any sensitivity test on the threshold value of driving forces? How does the ensemble change?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: We tested different window size to separate the baseline component and the results confirm a robustness of the applied methodology.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Questioner Name</Emphasis>: Rostislav Kouznetsov</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: Separate weighting of harmonics might result in negative predicted concentrations. How such situations should be treated?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: In theory it is possible to obtain negative values because of the negative signal in the filter residuals. However, the baseline of time series is always positive and it is very important for the final ensemble. In practice, the negative value means that the ensemble is not properly calibrated and the model weights should be analyzed more carefully.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Questioner Name</Emphasis>: Jeremy Silver</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: Were there gaps in the time-series of observations? If so, how did deal with this?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: The completeness of the time series was one of the criteria to select the monitoring stations for the current analysis. Moreover, one of the advantages of KZ filter is its good performance in the presence of gaps in the time series.</SimplePara>
