                <Para TextBreak="No">In modern western industrial countries, there has been a long history of attempts to deal with health issues associated with the work environment. Indeed, with the start of the industrial revolution, the financial issues of compensation for negligent accidental injuries in the workplace became significant. As succinctly reviewed by Anderson (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00012">1991</CitationRef>), the first actual successful personal work injury case of this type in the English High Court dated back to 1836. In such cases, it was important to provide proof of negligence in the actual workplace, but the litigation was not valid if there was so-called contributory negligence on the part of the worker, or if the actual accident was caused by “ordinary risks” in the workplace. However, the following year, the English courts accepted the “fellow-servant” doctrine, which stated that an employer was not responsible for negligence on the part of another employee or “fellow-servant.” Of course, this was the expected “push back” from employers who were used to using workers and then simply replacing them with new workers without the need to pay any compensation. Indeed, this perspective was captured in the writings of individuals such as Engel’s (<Emphasis Type="Italic">The Condition</Emphasis>
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">of the</Emphasis>
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Working Class</Emphasis>
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">in England</Emphasis>, 1845) and Marx (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Das Kapital</Emphasis>, 1867) who portrayed the terrible ways in which industrial-revolution capitalism exploited workers, which produced alienation of workers when treated simply as commodities in the growing capitalistic system (Engels, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000118">1845</CitationRef>; Marx, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000139">1867</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The next step, though, toward modern compensation laws was the English “Fatal Accident Act,” which required some financial compensation to the family of a person killed by an accident at the workplace. Moreover, at about this same point in time, German law decreed that railroad companies were responsible for any accidents that occurred on the new Berlin–Potsdam Railroad. As Anderson (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00012">1991</CitationRef>) goes on to note:
<BlockQuote>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">Parallel development in Germany and England during the 1880s resulted in more comprehensive insurance laws. Bismarck introduced a comprehensive social insurance system in Germany, which included workers’ compensation, and compulsory insurance was introduced in England through the Employers Liability Act (1880). Up until this time, fault had to be proven by the injured worker. This was abolished in England by the Workman’s Compensation Act (1887), which, by 1911 covered all workers and not only those injured in accidents but also those with industrial diseases and sickness as well. (pp. 531–532)</Para>
                  </BlockQuote>
                </Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In Europe, this industrial liability became part of a social security and welfare system, as well as the working conditions. For example, by 1992, every nation in the European Union was required to adapt, into their own national legislative mandate, that employers were responsible for evaluating all major occupational risk factors that may negatively affect employee health and safety. However, in the USA, the acceptance of employer responsibility was initially developed as a separate, no-fault system. It was not until 1908 that the Federal Employees Compensation Act was passed and, in 1914, the California Industrial Accident Act was subsequently passed. Unlike a federal disability system that existed in Europe, employers in the USA were sold private insurance coverage with the promise of immunity from liability suits on behalf of an employee. After World War II, such US employer-based health insurance became common. Thus, private insurance companies, such as Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., were developed as the “middle man” between employees and the State in workers’ compensation cases. The State bought this private insurance from such companies, which then would protect the States by making any liability claims the responsibility of private insurance carriers such as Liberty Mutual. Each State was free to purchase their own workers’ compensation insurance policies for workers of that State. Because of this, the workers’ compensation insurance requirements will be quite different from State to State. By 1949, separate workers’ compensation systems existed in all States. Moreover, as noted in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00011">1.1</InternalRef>, in 1954, the Social Security Disability Act was passed by Congress, which created a “second major layer of disability compensation” administered by the Federal government. Thus, in terms of actual physical injuries caused in the workplace, workers started to become more protected by compensation systems, although there were many vagaries across the different systems that could make it either easier or more difficult to obtain palpable benefits across workers and across different States. Subsequently, Medicare and Medicaid were introduced in 1965. The Health Management Organization (HMO) Act was passed in 1973 which opened up managed care networks in the private sector. Most recently, the federal health care plan was passed in 2010, which is still encountering a great deal of resistance. Finally, we would be remiss if not to mention the fact that, over the years in the USA, the national expenditures for health care have increased dramatically (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00011">1.1</InternalRef>). There has also been a shift in who is responsible for these health-care expenditures (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00012">1.2</InternalRef>).<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00011">

Out-of-pocket health insurance premiums paid by individuals are not included in Consumer Out-of-Pocket; they are counted as part of Private Health Insurance. Medicaid spending for the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (which began in 1998) is included in Other Government Programs, not in Medicaid.

                <Heading>“Unhealthy” Work Environments</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Another area of occupational health concerns started to occur with the great advances in science during the nineteenth century. This marked the era where “better life through better chemistry” became the mantra. A broad range of chemical and biological neurotoxins, such as lead, mercury, organic solvents, and asbestos fibers, were introduced into the workplace. For example, an Ohio inventor named Thomas Midgley Jr. developed an interest in the industrial applications of chemistry. As reviewed by Bryson (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00015">2003</CitationRef>), while working for the General Motors Research Corp., Midgley investigated a new compound called <Emphasis Type="Italic">tetraethyl lead</Emphasis>, and discovered that it could significantly reduce the degenerative condition known as “engine knock” in automobiles. Because of its success, it became a routine additive to gasoline. Unfortunately, lead is a neurotoxin, and too much exposure to it can significantly damage the central nervous system, and cause associated symptoms such as blindness, insomnia, kidney failure, and cancer. Indeed, once production of leaded gasoline started, many of the workers involved in this production started to develop significant neurological symptoms associated with over-exposure, such as neurological disorders highlighted by staggered gait and confused faculties indicative of lead poisoning. However, because of the great deal of money being produced by this lead additive (indeed, three of America’s largest corporations—General Motors, DuPont, and Standard Oil—formed a joint enterprise called the Ethyl Gasoline Corp.), there was a major corporation/political denial of these adverse symptoms on workers. It was not until it became known that leaded gas engine exhaust became a major environmental threat to the atmosphere that the Clean Air Act of 1970 was finally passed which eliminated the sale of all leaded gasoline in the USA in 1986. Subsequently, it was immediately found that lead levels in the blood of Americans fell by 80 %. Lead was also subsequently removed from indoor paints and other products. However, unfortunately, the amount of lead in the atmosphere continues to grow even today due to mining, smelting, and other industrial activities in the USA, as well as in the rest of the World. Moreover, because of the great amount of economic pressure to maintain/increase industrial growth with new scientific discoveries for which no health hazards are <Emphasis Type="Italic">currently</Emphasis> known, it is often the case that problematic symptoms and diseases must first occur before there is any federally backed pressure to curtail such processes. For example, this may currently be the case in the widespread use of plastics, which are produced from by-products of the refining of oil and natural gas (producing <Emphasis Type="Italic">polyethylenes</Emphasis> that are carcinogen risks). However, the “proof of burden” rests on the workers/general population to empirically demonstrate, in a scientifically acceptable manner, a “cause–effect” relationship between a certain newly isolated neurotoxin and negative health consequences. This, unfortunately, can take many years if not decades to demonstrate. Of course, the Environmental Protection Agency has been developed to help monitor this, but often there may be political pressure by large multi-national companies to “overlook” premature assumed illness consequences.</Para>

              <Heading>Medicolegal Issues and Occupational Injuries</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In other chapters of this Handbook, various issues related to occupational injuries will be reviewed. Of course, whenever there is an occupational accident or injury, there are usually medicolegal issues that ensue. Because of this, it is important to become aware of such issues and how they have been evaluated in the past and present. Howard, Kishino, Johnston, Worzer, and Gatchel (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000134">2010</CitationRef>) have recently provided an overview of this topic in the context of pain-related injuries. However, the major issues are generalizable to other work-related injuries, issues such as losses and gains, malingering, and “litigation neurosis.” These will be reviewed next.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00015">
                <Heading>Losses and Gains</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The development and perpetuation of work-related disability can be attributed to both losses and gains following an occupational injury (Worzer, Kishino, &amp; Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000163">2009</CitationRef>). Losses and gains at the most basic level are quite relatively easy to identify. For example, once an injury occurs, a primary loss may be reflected by the loss of employment; a primary gain could be seen as the alleviation of guilt/conflict manifested in physical symptoms (Dersh, Polatin, Leeman, &amp; Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000112">2009</CitationRef>). In marked contrast, secondary losses and gains are consequential to the initial incident. Following a traumatic event (such as an occupational injury), for example, there is often a downward spiral of occurrences that may exacerbate the chronic injury-produced condition. Some examples of these secondary losses can include: financial loss; loss of social relationships at work; loss of respect from family and friends; loss of community approval, and guilt over disability (Dersh, Gatchel, &amp; Kishino, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000111">2005</CitationRef>). The culmination of these losses can perpetuate the chronic occupational injury. Similarly, secondary gains have been found to maintain the disability as well. While earlier definitions of secondary gain were associated with the support one received from others following a traumatic event (Freud, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000123">1917</CitationRef>), subsequent renditions of the term secondary gain have been attributed to the gain of financial rewards related to disability (Finneson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000119">1976</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">While secondary gain is often deemed as a form of reinforcement for disability behaviors, Worzer et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000163">2009</CitationRef>) distinguish the two concepts, such that reinforcement relates to external ­factors (such as monetary gain), whereas secondary gain relates to internal factors (such as the motivation to seek monetary gain). In point of fact, secondary gains have long been viewed as a main motivator that contributes to malingering in chronic disability populations (Fishbain, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000120">1994</CitationRef>; <CitationRef CitationID="CR000163">Worzer et al.</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Malingering</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The term malingering has developed a negative connotation, in that a person is considered to be intentionally projecting exaggerated physical or and/or psychosocial symptoms for the purpose of gaining external rewards (American Psychiatric Association, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00011">2000</CitationRef>). While these rewards often include obtaining financial compensation, the act of malingering is also noted in the avoidance of activities, such as military duty or employment, or in obtaining drugs. According to the DSM-IV, at least two of the ­following four criteria must be met for a diagnosis of malingering:

                </Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">However, there has been criticism of the DSM-IV’s criteria as being moralistic and lacking in empirical validity. Rogers (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000151">1997</CitationRef>), for example, regards the above criteria to be quite lacking in that, by meeting just two of the four components, only two-thirds of the individuals were found to be properly diagnosed. Furthermore, he identified that, for every malingerer correctly diagnosed, four other individuals are misclassified. Obviously, this reflects an unacceptably higher false-positive rate.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">One particular area which has received extensive attention in terms of malingering is whiplash injuries, usually occurring after a motor vehicle collision. Such collisions often produce injuries to the neck or other body regions, and subsequent persistent pain and disability. Over the years, accumulated evidence suggested that such injuries involved not only a medical issue but were also influenced by external, non-injury psychosocial factors (Schrader et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000155">1996</CitationRef>). In fact, some have suggested that patients involved in litigation, or seeking legal representation for the whiplash injury, often must repeatedly “prove” their illness as real (Hadler, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000131">1996</CitationRef>; Harder, Veilleux, &amp; Suissa, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000132">1998</CitationRef>). This, in turn, causes the individual to overly focus on his/her symptoms, with the resultant skewing of the perception of the magnitude of their pain, suffering, and disability. This, unfortunately, can promote delayed recovery from the injuries. The same pattern can emerge in patients with occupational injury disabilities.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Are all individuals with occupational disabilities and motor vehicle injuries malingerers? According to Dersh and colleagues (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000112">2009</CitationRef>), the general assumption from the medicolegal perspective is that there is a high potential for malingering in workers’ compensation populations based on the prevalence of secondary gains. However, most researchers have failed to show a strong relationship between malingering and general workers’ compensation disability. Simply because secondary gains are present do not imply that the individual is a malingerer (Fishbain, Rosomoff, Cutler, &amp; Rosomoff, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000122">1995</CitationRef>). In fact, true malingering is sometimes considered to be connected to sociopathy, such that there is a history of “deviant or maladaptive behaviors,” whereas most individuals injured on the job show little to no psychopathology prior to the incident (Dersh et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000112">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">An alternative model of malingering put forth by Rogers (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000151">1997</CitationRef>) describes malingering as an adaptation, such that people will assess their specific goals and then utilize malingering as a method to obtain those goals. According to this model, the act of malingering is only associated with the attainment of the specific goals and not with any other social realms. While these malingerers are seen to participate in all opportunities to exhibit and validate their disability, they will tend to be non-compliant in the actual treatment program. Non-malingerers, however, should be expected to show difficulties with all facets of their lives.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Through a review of the literature on malingering and disability, Fishbain et al., (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000180">1999</CitationRef>) identified that the proportion of chronic pain patients who are probable malingerers ranged between 1.25 and 10.4 %, whereas Mittenberg, Patton, Canyock, and Condit (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000145">2002</CitationRef>) estimated the base rate for probable malingering and symptom exaggeration for individuals with workers’ compensation disability to reach 32 %. Within a workers’ compensation population reporting “stress” injuries, Sumanti, Brauer Boone, Savodnik, and Gorsuch (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000157">2006</CitationRef>) concluded that between 9 and 29 % of the cohort exhibited non-credible psychiatric symptoms, and 8 % showed non-credible cognitive deficiencies.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Fishbain and colleagues proposed that the degree of malingering for patients may be better understood when evaluated on different levels, such that some individuals can be regarded more as “true” malingerers, while others fall into a “partial” range. The distinction between these levels depends on the actual health condition of the individual. A true malingerer will have no health or disability ailments and will falsify the health assessments to appear to be ill; whereas a partial malingerer, who has some form of disability, will be more likely to exaggerate the symptoms (Fishbain, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000121">1999</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Section2 ID="Sec00017">
                <Heading>“Compensation Neurosis” and “Litigation Neurosis”</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In the medicolegal context, the terms Compensation Neurosis and Litigation Neurosis refer to the amplification of physical and psychosocial symptoms, whether conscious or unconscious, when faced with secondary gains (Fishbain et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000122">1995</CitationRef>; Robinson, Rondinelli, Scheer, &amp; Weinstein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000150">1997</CitationRef>). In fact, compensation neurosis was first introduced in the 1880s as part of industrial accident litigation (Margoshes &amp; Webster, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000138">2000</CitationRef>). It was thought that people who had work-related disability would exaggerate their somatic complaints due to the fact that they suffered from psychiatric disorders (such as depression and neurosis). However, once they received a “curative” financial settlement, they were then able to return-to-work. Recent studies, though, have refuted this concept (Margoshes &amp; Webster, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000138">2000</CitationRef>). Some earlier research has shown that, when comparing individuals with similar disabilities, those with occupational injuries have been found to demonstrate poorer treatment outcomes as compared to those whose injuries are not related to workers’ compensation (Rainville, Sobel, Hartigan, &amp; Wright, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000148">1997</CitationRef>; Robinson et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000150">1997</CitationRef>). In contrast, research has also shown that chronic pain patients who may be identified as having “litigation neurosis” showed no physical improvement following a resolution of their disability claims (Bellamy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00014">1997</CitationRef>; Fishbain et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000122">1995</CitationRef>). Bellamy (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00014">1997</CitationRef>) cites several theories as to why the “malingerer” would continue to feign symptoms after the disability case is settled. One theory states that the continuation of disability may be a form of punishment toward the entity (e.g., the “non-caring Company”) that caused the injury. A second theory proposes that recovering from the disability would be seen as admission to fraud, and the chronic disability-case patient may feel the need to defend his/her disability for fear of the loss of benefits. In a more comprehensive approach to defining compensation neurosis, because the system provides financial rewards for illness and injury, the physician is often seen as the “gatekeeper” to the disability benefits. Therefore, the chronic disability patient feels the need to exaggerate his/her symptoms when being challenged or re-examined (Bellamy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00014">1997</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">While the incidence rate of true malingering has been identified to be fairly low, oftentimes the employers and insurance providers make assumptions regarding the nature or severity of the injury and the intent of the injured employee. By doing so, the practitioner or insurance provider may develop a certain bias toward individuals with occupational injuries. Patients with chronic occupational injuries tend to display increased disability, which is often noted as limited function. Functional disability is affected by not only the physical condition, but also can be exacerbated by cognitive and psychosocial factors (such as fear of re-injury). Through the recognition and resolution of barriers that impede recovery, patients with chronic occupational musculoskeletal injuries, for example, are better able to regain function and resume normal activities, thus lessening disability behaviors (McIntosh, Melles, &amp; Hall, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000144">1995</CitationRef>). Similar to the effects of psychosocial distress, disability behaviors have often been thought to hinder recovery for individuals with chronic occupational injuries. The term disability behavior relates to the individual’s sickness role based on the perception of a benefit associated with the injury (Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000124">2004</CitationRef>). It is possible for these disability behaviors to be interpreted as malingering. And if so, the consequence of limiting or withholding treatment can result in additional distress and further exacerbate disability behaviors, thus perpetuating the malingering assumption (Margoshes &amp; Webster, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000138">2000</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">As noted by Margoshes and Webster (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000138">2000</CitationRef>), the current and more enlightened approach to this issue of malingering is the biopsychosocial model (a model we will emphasize later in this present chapter). They go on to point out that one should respond to a patient’s illness, behaviors, and possible malingering by providing appropriate treatment and rehabilitation. As they highlight:
<BlockQuote>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">… models looking at disability exaggeration were unable to predict poor outcomes for chronic low back pain patients in a multidisciplinary treatment program. This may be because the program studied provided counseling that addressed those factors that led to disability exaggeration, including “fear of re-injury, overly protective spouses, physician warnings against painful activity, anxiety, depression, and other personality features”… It is therefore recommended that rehabilitation programs include counseling to address these factors.

                <Para TextBreak="No">Finally, while it is hypothesized that many chronic disability patients may exhibit malingering tendencies, the detection of malingering can be difficult to validate.

The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Structured Interview</Emphasis>
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">of Reported</Emphasis>
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Symptoms</Emphasis> (SIRS) was designed to directly parallel Roger’s detection strategies (Rogers, Bagby &amp; Dickens, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000152">1992</CitationRef>). Other assessments that have been used to detect malingering include basic IQ testing and neuropsychological testing (Conroy &amp; Kwartner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000110">2006</CitationRef>). Most recently, a Special Issue on Malingering and its assessment was published in <Emphasis Type="Italic">Psychological Injury</Emphasis>
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">and Law</Emphasis> [March, 2011, <Emphasis Type="Italic">4</Emphasis> (1)]. However, a strong word of caution should be raised here. From a medicolegal standpoint, the presence of secondary gain (e.g., financial reward) following an occupational injury can provide an individual with the motivation to “malinger” or to exaggerate physical and psychological symptoms. However, the prevalence of true malingering in chronic disability populations has been shown to be fairly low (Howard, Kishino, Johnston, Worzer, &amp; Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000134">2010</CitationRef>). The main quandary is in knowing the best method to assess potential malingering. Several strategies have been developed for such assessment, such as those just mentioned. However, it is the contention of many that it is more clinically feasible and valid to move away from the overly subjective and perjorative term “malingering” in the occupational pain and disability evaluation. Instead, replace that subjective construct method with a more comprehensive biopsychosocial-based approach to identify barriers to recovery that may significantly affect patient effort/responses on objective performance tests, as well as consistency in reporting certain symptoms or deficits. This biopsychosocial approach would be more clinically ­effective in determining possible pain and resulting disability.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A careful and comprehensive evaluation is quite warranted in order to prevent patients from taking advantage of the medical, insurance, and legal systems. As Hadler (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000131">1996</CitationRef>) has noted: “If you have to prove you are ill, you can never get well…” (p. 2397). Thus, there may be external pressure on patients to prove they are really ill. This should be kept in mind when evaluating patients. Also, the misdiagnosis of an individual as a “malingerer” can inappropriately drop patients from their deserved medical benefits. Such assessment data are greatly needed in order to “tailor” the most effective biopsychosocial treatment program to the unique needs of specific patients. For individuals with occupational injuries, if malingering goes undetected, then those individuals are able to take advantage of the medical, insurance, and legal systems. However, if malingering is misdiagnosed, then individuals with true disability can be erroneously dropped from their deserved benefits.</Para>

              <Heading>Occupational Stress</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Another important area of occupational health and illness that has become more recently recognized is occupational stress. Indeed, stress is ubiquitous in the workplace. Many jobs involve pressure to complete increasing amounts of work, and these pressures can contribute to social overload and stress (Baum, Gatchel, &amp; Krantz, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00013">1997</CitationRef>). Much of this research in the area of occupational stress and health started in the 1990s, with attempts to determine which occupations were most stressful, or which characteristics of particular occupations were causes of elevated risks of coronary heart disease (Karasek &amp; Theorell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000135">1990</CitationRef>). Indeed, it was found that several broad types of working conditions had been associated with coronary heart disease risk (Baum et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00013">1997</CitationRef>). These include the psychological demands of the job, autonomy on the job (e.g., how much input workers have in making decisions), and satisfaction on the jobsite. Job demands refer to job conditions that tax or interfere with the workers’ performance abilities, such as workload and work responsibilities. The level of job autonomy refers to the ability of the workers to control the speed, nature, and conditions of work. Job satisfaction includes gratification of the workers’ needs and aspirations derived from employment. It has been found that low levels of control over one’s job, as well as excess of workload, seem to be a particular important combination in heightening job-related stress. Karasek and Theorell (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000135">1990</CitationRef>) have proposed that conditions of high work demands, combined with few opportunities to control the job situation (e.g., slow decisional latitude), are associated with increase coronary heart disease risk. The conditions of high demand and low control are called <Emphasis Type="Italic">high strain</Emphasis> situations. Indeed, the Karasek “job demand/control” hypothesis has been tested in several populations, and has been shown to predict cardiovascular disease or mortality in studies of male Swedish workers and studies of men and women in the USA (Karasek &amp; Theorell; Karasek et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000136">1988</CitationRef>; Schnall et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000154">1990</CitationRef>). In a later chapter in this Handbook, Theorell provides a more thorough review of these above studies.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Another interesting study of occupational stress and coronary heart disease among women also illustrates how job conditions may contribute to coronary disease. Work and family demands and one’s control over these situations appear to be important buffers of stress. For example, it has been found that working women (that is, women who had been employed outside the home for more than one half of their adult lives) were compared to housewives and with men. Results revealed that working women in general were not at a significantly higher risk of subsequent coronary heart disease than housewives. However, it was found that the following were more likely to develop coronary heart disease: clerical workers, who perhaps have low job control; working women with children, who have high family demands; and women whose bosses were unsupportive (Baum et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00013">1997</CitationRef>). Interestingly, the likelihood of coronary heart disease increases linearly with the number of children for working women. Relatedly, in a recent and more thorough review of the literature, Terrill, Garofalo, Soliday, and Craft (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000159">2012</CitationRef>) have proposed a more comprehensive model for why coronary heart disease is a leading cause of mortality in adult women, particularly working mothers (they also provide a more detailed review of this in a later chapter in the present Handbook). They suggest it is due to a confluence of factors. Among them are the following:

                <Heading>The Nature of Stress</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Because the construct of stress underlies many of the topics in this Handbook, it will be worthwhile to review important issues related to the nature of stress here at the outset. This has been previously reviewed in greater detail by Gatchel and Baum (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000126">2009</CitationRef>). Stress is a complex process, which leads to a broad-based series of changes across the entire organism. Most clinical researchers agree that stress is initiated and regulated by the central nervous system (CNS), which provides information about the environment and the periphery, and then interprets and acts on this information. The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord, and connects to peripheral nerves that relay sensory information and executes directions to and from the brain. Part of this process is appraisal, a neurally based interpretation of afferent stimuli in the context of beliefs and perceptions of resources and other conditions. Depending on the nature of this process, the CNS issues commands to the body, either to maintain ongoing activity or to modify it to deal with the object of this appraisal. Thus, one can view the brain as “taking in” information about the environment, as well as the state of the rest of the body and, if this appraisal yields the “conclusion” that prevailing conditions may threaten harm, loss or excessive demand, stress responses are then produced.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">It should be noted that all the basic principles of this appraisal process are not yet known, but research has indicated that two neuroendocrine systems are the primary underlying instigators of integrated stress responses. For example, upon recognition of threat or demand, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical (HPA) axis will respond, and then accomplish a number of basic and excitatory functions. The SNS innervates most regions of the body, descending from the hypothalamus and extending to most organ systems and tissues throughout the body. Activation of the SNS results in increased physiological reactivity (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and other functions) that distributes nutrients to the body. Changes in hemodynamic responses then result in greater blood flow, delivering oxygen and glucose to the cells and organs of the body. Increased respiration increases oxygen available, and other changes liberate energy into easily transportable form. This permits stronger, faster responses. At the same time, SNS activity modifies the distribution of blood to specific parts of the body, whereby constriction of some blood vessels causes reduction of blood flow to the gut, skin and reproductive systems, and selective dilation of other blood vessels, resulting in increased muscle tone, strength, and performance. SNS activation as a consequence of perceived threat or demand produces an aroused, alert and strengthened organism in preparation for coping (e.g., the well-known “fight or flight” reflex).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Of course, the initial arousal of the SNS is a function of the nervous system, but neural stimulation of the SNS is relatively short-lived and may not be sufficiently intense to evoke the required strong responses. Therefore, to some extent, prolonged and more intense responses are associated with endocrine system release of epinephrine from the adrenal medullae and norepinephrine from both the adrenal medullae and from neurons in the SNS. The release of these hormones into circulation have the same effects as SNS arousal accomplished by direct neural stimulation, but take longer to “clear” the system, and may produce a more intense response. The release of epinephrine, for example, stimulates the same heart and respiratory changes that accompany neural stimulation of the SNS, but the different mechanisms that convey these effects (e.g., receptor binding vs. synaptic transmission) alter the strength and persistence of responding. Some effects of SNS arousal appear to be exclusive to endocrine responses but, for the most part, these neuroendocrine responses work together. The HPA axis is different and, although it is also an integrated neuroendocrine response originating in the hypothalamus, it unfolds in different ways and accomplishes different things. For example, activity in this system is initiated by release of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the brain, which stimulates the pituitary to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which then travels to the adrenals and stimulates release of corticosteroids from the adrenal cortex. In humans, these glucocorticoids are primarily cortisol, a hormone that has important anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects. Stress appraisals are believed to be associated with CRH release, and the arousal of the HPA has been considered another principal driver of the overall stress response.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">These two above systems work together in order to provide redundant coverage of some survival functions and complementary coverage of others. The SNS and HPA differ in how responsive they are. For example, the SNS causes measurable changes in circulating sympathetic hormones and increased cardiac and respiratory function, almost immediately after stimulation. However, the HPA axis is more “sluggish,” and can take up to 20–30 min to show responses after stimulation (Dickerson &amp; Kemeny, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000113">2004</CitationRef>). Moreover, the effects of SNS activation can dissipate as rapidly as they appeared, while HPA responses are more long-lived. Both are catabolic in nature, in that they break down energy stores, and also increase capture and transport of oxygen and distribution of glucose to areas of the body. Each has a number of important targets and functions, some of which overlap with stress. Together, they provide the regulatory basis for the energizing effects of stress.</Para>

                <Heading>Stress and Health</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The above systems, and the effects that they have on biobehavioral functioning, provide a context for understanding how and why stress has a number of consequences that affect health and well-being. This basic syndrome is present in many species. The elements of response fit together well, and they appear to have been selected because of their benefits for adaptation to the environment. In addition, such a process began before humans had appeared and unfolded through thousands of years of human development. Some have suggested that, because the world that was the basis for evolution of stress responses was the world of thousands of years ago, the nature of the selected responses may not be that useful or adaptive in our modern world. The stressors were different and “successful” responses different as well. At the time these integrated responses evolved, the earth was likely filled with immediate threats such as those posed by predators, geological or meteorological events, and famine. If the primary stressors in one’s life include avoiding predators and providing food, the “fight or flight” responses described by Cannon (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00017">1939</CitationRef>) would clearly confer an advantage and facilitate survival. In modern settings, though, where stressors may include sensory overload, alienation, crowding, and financial and occupational worries that ultimately may threaten one’s ability to provide, the value of some of these energizing effects may be less. Even though these basic responses are still useful for some stressors (e.g., sudden life threat, accidents, challenges), they may not be effective in resolving others, and may produce unneeded and persistent and/or unusually intense responses, which may damage the body and cause distress, disease, and disability.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The activity of the stress “drivers” described above can be expected to have broad effects on the body, mood, and behavior. Basically, these may be considered to be stress responses or consequences. The distinction between them is generally derived from the relevance of the change for adaptation. Stress responses are changes, mostly mediated directly by SNS or HPA activation, that are either part of the emergency response or that are directly related to coping or adaptation to stressful circumstances. As was noted above, these changes are related to meeting the metabolic demands of strong and/or rapid responding, or to strengthening physical response, early identification of stressors, and coping. However, this arousal may also cause feelings of discomfort and may affect bodily systems that are not directly related to adaptation, or may cause “wear and tear” on systems used too often. These latter aspects of stress are more readily considered to be consequences, and form a basis for the pathophysiology of disease and mental health problems. Although the discomfort associated with stress arousal clearly motivates people to address the sources of stress, it does not directly increase one’s ability to overcome them and may engender anxiety, depression, fear, anger, or irritability. In the workplace, this may contribute to absenteeism, poorer performance, conflict with co-workers, etc. Thus, stress responses, usually thought of as facilitating adaptation, may do so if the stressors in question are addressable with the kinds of physical responses selected. However, if the stressors are unusually strong or persistent, adaptation may not be achieved, and stress responses may actually increase in a maladaptive way. Under such conditions, unusually intense or prolonged SNS and HPA arousal, as well as arousal of the systems of the body affected by these neuroendocrine systems, may cause significant stress consequences. Excessive use of these systems, often at high levels of activity, can cause aging of the cells and systems of the body. In most cases, the major sources of stress are more readily avoided, accommodated, or eliminated, and responses may not engender severe consequences.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Finally, another important area of concern for occupational health and illness are behavioral habits that have health-impairing consequences. These health-impairing habits have been called <Emphasis Type="Italic">behavioral pathogens</Emphasis> (Matarazzo, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000140">1984</CitationRef>). In fact, early reports focusing on the importance of behavioral factors in health had estimated that 50 % of the mortality from the 10 leading causes of death could be attributed to lifestyle habits (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000162">1979</CitationRef>). For example, cigarette smoking had been linked with more than 350,000 deaths a year from heart disease, cancers, and chronic lung diseases (Grunberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000130">1988</CitationRef>). An analysis of international data by Peto, Boreham, Lopez, Thun, and Heath (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000147">1992</CitationRef>) also projected that three million deaths worldwide each year can be attributed to smoking. About 200,000 deaths a year can be attributed to excessive consumption of alcohol, and fatal injuries (many alcohol-related were caused by driver error and preventative by the use of seatbelts) claimed more than 100,000 each year in the USA (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000161">1990</CitationRef>). Other estimates suggest that seven of the ten leading causes of death in this country (heart disease, cancer, stroke, automobile accidents, diabetes, cirrhosis of the liver, and arteriosclerosis) could be reduced significantly if vulnerable individuals would change just five behaviors: smoking, alcohol abuse, nutrition, exercise, and compliance to medications to control hypertension (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000161">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</CitationRef>—<Emphasis Type="Italic">Healthy People</Emphasis>

              <Heading>Prevention Approaches</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The significant relationships between the above mentioned major chronic diseases and modifiable behavioral pathogens that are under the individual’s control have fostered prevention-oriented research and practice in clinical health psychology. It is now common to classify preventive efforts into three broad types. The first is <Emphasis Type="Italic">primary prevention</Emphasis> which refers to the modification of risk factors before the disease develops. In many respects, this is a highly cost-effective and beneficial strategy because, in the long term, the potential cost of life in dollars of treating disease are likely to outweigh the cost of preventing unhealthy habits. Examples of primary prevention efforts include educational campaigns to prevent adolescents from smoking or to encourage “safe sex” practices to prevent AIDS. Primary prevention is effective, but it is particularly challenging since it is often difficult to motivate otherwise healthy people to make changes in their behavior that may not have immediate benefits, despite the promise of long-term gains (Baum et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00013">1997</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The terms <Emphasis Type="Italic">secondary prevention</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">tertiary prevention</Emphasis> refer, respectively, to interventions taken to arrest the progress of an illness already in the asymptomatic stages, and the rehabilitation and treatment interventions to stop the progression of disease that is symptomatic. Although less cost-effective and perhaps less beneficial in the long run, secondary and tertiary prevention activities may be easier to accomplish in the appropriate target groups (e.g., those that are ill) because they can be easily identified and are more motivated to change their behavior.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">There are tremendous health-care cost savings, to both the government and industry in general, for initiating such primary, secondary, and tertiary intervention programs in the workplace. Indeed, the advent of the field of Occupational Health Psychology, which had with its initial roots highlighted in the document “Healthy People: The Surgeon General’s Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention” (Surgeon General, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000158">1979</CitationRef>), first signaled the importance of taking human psychological well-being in occupational settings as an important goal for preventing disease states. As a result, the number of employers offering workplace wellness programs with financial incentives to employees has been steadily rising in the USA, despite the recent economic recession (National Business Group on Health, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000146">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Its Roots: The Biopsychosocial Perspective of Illness</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">During the Renaissance, the increased scientific knowledge in the areas of anatomy, biology, and physiology was accompanied by a <Emphasis Type="Italic">biomedical reductionism</Emphasis>, or a “dualistic” viewpoint, that mind and body function separately and independently. Unfortunately, this perspective dominated medicine until quite recently. However, a more comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to medicine was initially introduced by Engel (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000117">1977</CitationRef>). This biopsychosocial model viewed physical disorders as the result of a dynamic interaction among physiologic, psychological, and social factors that perpetuates and may even worsen the clinical presentation. A range of psychological and socioeconomic factors can interact with physical pathology to modulate a patient’s reports of symptoms and subsequent disability. This biopsychosocial model was subsequently more fully elaborated in the area of chronic pain management (Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000125">2005</CitationRef>; Turk &amp; Monarch, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000160">2002</CitationRef>). The biopsychosocial model focuses on both <Emphasis Type="Italic">disease</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">illness</Emphasis>, with illness being viewed as a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social variables. According to <CitationRef CitationID="CR000160">Turk and Monarch</CitationRef>, disease is defined as “an objective biological event” involving the destruction of specific body structures or organ systems by either anatomical, pathological, or physiological changes. Illness, in contrast, is generally defined as a “subjective experience or self attribution” that a disease is present. Thus, illness refers to how a sick individual and members of his or her family live with, and respond to, symptoms and disability. As originally proposed by Engel (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000117">1977</CitationRef>), such a biopsychosocial model focuses primarily on illness. With this perspective, a diversity of illness expression (including its severity, duration, and psychosocial consequences) can be expected. The interrelationships among biological changes, psychosocial status, and the socioeconomic context all need to be considered if the patient’s perception and response to illness are to be fully understood. Any model or treatment approach that focuses on only one of these core sets of factors would be incomplete. As can be seen in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00013">1.3</InternalRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000117">Engel’s</CitationRef> conceptual model of illness includes factors that include not only the initial physical problem, but the subsequent psychosocial factors (such as emotional distress, illness behavior, and adopting the “sick role”).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00013">

                <Para TextBreak="No">This biopsychosocial model has been demonstrated to be especially heuristic in the area of chronic pain and its management. Indeed, the most promising work on pain conducted thus far has embraced a biopsychosocial, interdisciplinary approach in which the psychosocial needs of patients require careful evaluation and treatment, along with the concurrent physical problems (Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000124">2004</CitationRef>). This interdisciplinary approach requires the coordinated involvement of physicians, psychologists, physical therapists, vocational rehabilitation specialists, etc., in order to comprehensively deal with the full gamut of potential issues present in treating a chronic illness. Relatedly, many of these common chronic illnesses (such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, asthma, gastrointestinal disorders, and chronic pain) cannot be “cured,” but merely managed. Indeed, with the advent of the biopsychosocial model, there has been a move away from the traditional biomedical reductionist “curative” model to a more realistic and comprehensive biopsychosocial “management” model of care. Indeed, as noted by Dubos (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000114">1978</CitationRef>):

                <Para TextBreak="No">There have been a number of reviews that have documented the clinical effectiveness of such an interdisciplinary treatment approach, especially with chronic pain patients (Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000125">2005</CitationRef>; Gatchel &amp; Okifuji, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000128">2006</CitationRef>). These programs are needed for people with chronic pain who have complex needs and requirements. One variant of such program—functional restoration—has been comprehensively described in detail in a number of publications (Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000125">2005</CitationRef>; Gatchel &amp; Mayer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000127">1988</CitationRef>; Mayer et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000143">1987b</CitationRef>). Clinical research has clearly demonstrated that the functional restoration program is associated with substantive improvements in various important socioeconomic outcomes (e.g., return-to-work and resolution of outstanding medical issues), as well as improvement in psychosocial functioning in patients who are chronically disabled with spinal disorders in 1-year follow up studies (Hazard et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000133">1989</CitationRef>; Mayer et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000141">1985</CitationRef>), as well as in a 2-year follow-up study (Mayer et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000142">1987a</CitationRef>). It should also be noted that this original functional restoration program has been independently replicated by others in this country, as well as by investigators in Denmark, France, Germany, Canada, and Japan (Gatchel &amp; Okifuji, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000128">2006</CitationRef>). The fact that different clinical treatment teams, functioning in different States and countries, with markedly different economic/social conditions and workers’ compensation systems, produced comparable outcome results speaks highly for the robustness of the clinical research finding and the utility, as well as the fidelity, of this functional restoration approach.

                <Heading>Beyond the Interdisciplinary Approach</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">There is now a growing appreciation that an interdisciplinary approach is essential for solving the complex problems of societal health care and wellness. It is worthwhile here to distinguish the differences among <Emphasis Type="Italic">multidisciplinary</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">interdisciplinary</Emphasis>, and <Emphasis Type="Italic">transdisciplinary</Emphasis> models. As noted by Dyer (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000115">2003</CitationRef>) in the context of nursing care/education, a <Emphasis Type="Italic">multidisciplinary</Emphasis> model involves the use of different disciplines that individually conducts separate assessment, planning, treatment, etc., but with little coordination across the disciplines. In contrast, an <Emphasis Type="Italic">interdisciplinary</Emphasis> model expands the multidisciplinary approach through an ongoing shared collaborative process where all members of the different disciplines are “under one roof” at a facility, with careful daily collaborations and decision making as a team. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">transdisciplinary</Emphasis> model is the result of the further evolution of the interdisciplinary team approach, and values the knowledge and skill of all team members. Indeed, with the now recognized requirement of multiple health-care providers for dealing with the complex needs often associated with the comprehensive treatment health problems, especially when they become chronic in nature (such as chronic pain), it is viewed as extremely important to have a “teamwork” approach. This teamwork approach recognizes that no one particular health-care provider has all the requisite skills and knowledge to deliver the best high-quality care. This type of teamwork was successfully incorporated in the interdisciplinary approach, as discussed above. The transdisciplinary model takes this approach one step farther in that each team member becomes so knowledgeable with the roles and responsibilities of the other team members that their tasks and functions become almost interchangeable (Cartmill, Soklaridis, &amp; David Cassidy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00018">2011</CitationRef>; Ellingson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000116">2002</CitationRef>; Klein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000137">2008</CitationRef>; Sinclair, Lingard, &amp; Mohabeer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000156">2009</CitationRef>). Thus, for example, a physical therapist becomes well versed in the approach of an occupational therapist, who then also both develop working knowledge of issues faced by case managers (such as insurance authorization and work-return plans). Likewise, physicians and psychologists on the team acquire the same knowledge base and can “fill in” for each other when needed. This results in coordinated staff team meetings where everyone is always “on the same page” and knowledgeable about barriers to recovery issues when they occur for any particular patient.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Throughout this Handbook, different areas of occupational health and wellness will be reviewed for which this transdisciplinary model is embraced. The relative degree of interactive and coordinated teamwork may vary, but its core ingredients will be seen as vital for success, both in the treatment and theory-building arenas.</Para>

              <Heading>Summary and Conclusions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">As was reviewed in this chapter, there is now an ever growing body of clinical research evidence relating to the field of occupational health and wellness. This is partly due to the fact that we are in the midst of rapid global economic growth, with the associated complex international and financial systems that produce a wide range of potentially significant problems (e.g., environmental and occupational hazards/diseases; workers’ safety and compensation issues; psychosocial stress). Moreover, we are now in the midst of an international recession that is causing a great deal of emotional distress and health problems triggered by high unemployment rates (which will be discussed in the last chapter of this Handbook). A brief historical overview of events that have led to the development of this field was provided, starting with the early European efforts to deal with occupational compensation issues that eventually spread to the USA during the last century. Moreover, with the rapid industrialization and scientific advances in the nineteenth century, many “unhealthy” work environments were unknowingly developed that had to subsequently be more closely monitored by the government through agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency. With the backdrop of those potentially physical hazards in the occupational setting, it was not until relatively recently (during the last couple of decades) that the potentially significant problem of occupational psychosocial stress became an important area of concern and investigation. This was first recognized as a major health problem by research demonstrating that broad types of working conditions had been associated with coronary heart disease risk. Factors such as job demands, job autonomy, and job satisfaction were found to particularly heighten job-related stress and associated medical problems. The construct of stress, which underlies many of the topics included in the present Handbook, was then reviewed. Basic physiological processes involved in stress, such as two major neuroendocrine systems (the SNS and the HPA axis) were reviewed. How these stress-induced physiological underpinnings can be translated into health problems was then discussed. The topic of behavioral pathogens (e.g., health-impairing habits such as smoking, alcohol use, and diet) were also discussed as they relate to health-impairing consequences. Finally, the importance of prevention approaches was also touched upon.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">We end this chapter with a discussion of the transdisciplinary model of occupational health and wellness. The roots of this model began with the biopsychosocial perspective of illness which was initially introduced by Engel (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000117">1977</CitationRef>), and then subsequently elaborated in the area of chronic pain management by Gatchel (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000125">2005</CitationRef>) and Turk and Moncarch (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000160">2002</CitationRef>). This biopsychosocial perspective emphasizes the complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social variables, for better understanding the diversity of illness expression. This perspective led to the development of interdisciplinary treatment programs that required the coordinated involvement of physicians, psychologists, physical therapists, vocational rehabilitation specialists, etc., in order to comprehensively deal with the full gamut of potential problems present in treating a chronic illness. This approach also emphasized a “management” model of care rather than the outdated “curative” model of care. One example of such an interdisciplinary program is the functional restoration approach to chronic pain assessment and management, which has been demonstrated to be therapeutically effective. This interdisciplinary approach led directly into the now transdisciplinary model which has taken this approach one step farther in that each team member involved in the assessment-treatment process becomes so knowledgeable with the roles and responsibilities of the other team members that their tasks and functions become almost interchangeable. Throughout this Handbook, we will be discussing different areas of occupational health and wellness for which this transdisciplinary model is, or should be, embraced.</Para>
