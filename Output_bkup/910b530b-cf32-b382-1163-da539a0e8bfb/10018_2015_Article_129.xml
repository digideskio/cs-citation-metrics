              <Para ID="Par1">Even though environmental innovations are generally considered a key element towards a green growth strategy, especially for the case of energy efficiency innovations, the impact on climate goals has been subject to a long-running debate. On the one hand, energy efficiency innovations provide a huge cost-effective CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> reduction potential. On the other hand, increasing energy efficiency implies cost reductions which in turn may lead to increased consumption due to the so-called rebound effect. Our study investigates the long-term environmental impact of energy efficiency innovations on the EU-27 residential electricity demand (excluding heating systems) using a detailed bottom-up modelling approach. Assuming a rebound effect of 10 %, we show that the diffusion of energy efficiency technologies with current policy levels provides savings of around 140 TWh and additional 270 TWh may be saved through additional policy measures accelerating the diffusion and development of new technologies until 2030. By contrast, assuming a (rather pessimistic) rebound effect of 40 %, the savings are reduced to around 95 and 180 TWh until 2030, respectively. We conclude that there is a clear case for ambitious policies to support energy efficiency innovations for the residential sector, which ideally should be complemented by measures to limit the rebound effect.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par2">The role of innovation for climate change mitigation has been discussed extensively in recent years. The transformation to a sustainable economy requires the development and deployment of energy technologies both on the supply and on the demand side (Foxon et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2008</CitationRef>; Wilson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2012</CitationRef>). At the same time, a number of studies have highlighted the limits of innovation for climate change mitigation, most importantly due to the rebound effect (Greening et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2000</CitationRef>; Sorrell et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2009</CitationRef>; Sorrell and Dimitropoulos <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para ID="Par3">Innovation in end-use energy efficiency has received increasing interest as a cost-effective solution to climate change mitigation. Recent studies have highlighted the under-investment in energy end-use technologies as compared to energy supply technologies (Wilson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2012</CitationRef>). At the same time, the large potential of energy end-use technologies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been highlighted in a number of studies (IEA <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2014</CitationRef>; Fraunhofer ISI <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2014</CitationRef>). Energy efficiency (EE) is of key importance to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to reach the European and national energy and climate policy targets. Furthermore, energy efficiency plays a critical role in addressing energy security, environmental and economic challenges (IEA <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2012</CitationRef>). The EU is aiming for a 20 % cut in Europe’s annual primary energy consumption by 2020 and has recently adopted an EU energy efficiency target of 27 % for 2030.<Footnote ID="Fn1">

              <Para ID="Par5">Currently, a so-called energy efficiency gap is observed between the actual uptake of energy efficiency innovations and the economically optimal level (Jaffe and Stavins <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">1994</CitationRef>; Allcott and Greenstone <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2012</CitationRef>). A variety of market imperfections and other barriers that prevent the uptake of energy efficiency innovations have been discussed and include information asymmetries, split incentives, lack of interaction between user and producer, lack of awareness and lack of upfront capital (Edler <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2013</CitationRef>). In order to effectively support a transformation of the market, it is essential to design a policy mix that addresses these barriers.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par6">This article focuses on residential appliances, lighting and air conditioning, which are regulated in the European product policy strategy aiming to reduce the environmental impact associated with the design, manufacturing, distribution, use and disposal of products. The two main pillars of the European product policy are the Ecodesign directive (2009/125/EC) and the Labelling directive (2010/30/EC). The Ecodesign directive sets out a framework to implement minimum requirements that the products need to fulfil if they are to display the CE branding, which is a condition for their placing on the EU market. The original directive from 2005 covered only energy-using products and was extended to energy-related products in 2009. The requirements on the individual product groups are set in implementing measures. The Labelling Directive is a framework to set requirements to communicate information on the energy efficiency of products in a clear and understandable format. Ecodesign and/or Labelling have currently been implemented for more than 45 product groups including the following: heating and water heating equipment, electric motors, lighting in the residential and tertiary sectors, domestic appliances, office equipment in the residential and tertiary sectors, consumer electronics, ventilation and air conditioning systems.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par7">The Ecodesign and Labelling directives address market imperfections related to information asymmetries and split incentives. Costantini et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2014</CitationRef>) analyse the factors affecting the dynamics of EE technologies in the residential sector and highlight the role played by public policies. Attali et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR01">2011</CitationRef>) point out that a market transformation towards high-efficiency appliances would be supported more effectively by including other instruments such as financial incentives into the policy mix.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par8">The aim of this work is to quantify the impact of the development and diffusion of environmental innovations on the long-term EU-27 residential electricity demand and CO2 emissions (excluding electricity demand attributed to heating systems) by comparing different long-term diffusion paths for various electricity-consuming devices. We use a detailed bottom-up model to project the effects of the development and diffusion of technological innovation. In this study, we consider three explorative scenarios within the temporal scope of 2010–2030 mapping different policy strategies to support innovation. In the frozen efficiency scenario, we provide a baseline assuming that the energy efficiency of the appliance market remains constant at the 2008 level. In the diffusion scenario, we model the impact of current policy measures, which mainly drive the diffusion of available energy efficiency technologies. In the innovation scenario, we model the impact of further policy measures to support the development of technologies going beyond the currently available level of efficiency.</Para>

The alternative choices that are available on the market differ both in energy efficiency and in their respective purchase prices.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par14">The market share of each appliance type is modelled as a result of individual investment decisions. The investment decisions are modelled as a discrete choice process, where household decision makers choose among alternative technologies competing with each other [see e.g. (Revelt and Train <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">1997</CitationRef>)]. Labelling has an influence on the investment decisions of consumers, directing preferences towards more energy-efficient devices (Bull <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2012</CitationRef>). Without Energy Labelling (or when most products have reached the highest Labelling class), consumers lack information about the life-cycle costs of appliances. A number of recent studies show that information on life-cycle costs has a significant effect on the investment decisions of consumers and contributes to lowering the discount rates for residential appliances (Kaenzig and Wuestenhagen <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2009</CitationRef>; Consumer Focus <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para ID="Par15">Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef> provides a schematic overview of our modelling approach. The global parameters setting the framework for electricity demand modelling are the end consumer prices and the number of households. The ownership rate development is projected using a Bass model (Bass <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">1969</CitationRef>). Path dependencies need to be considered in the context of decision-making as cost advantages vary depending on the type of end-use to be replaced. This means that lock-in effects have to be considered in terms of synthetic investment cost mark-ups as they essentially influence the transition probability. However, in comparison to the replacement of, for instance, heating systems in the residential sector, these cost mark-ups are rather small for appliances. The annual electricity demand is calculated as the product of the specific consumption per end-use and efficiency category and the corresponding stock.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

                <Para ID="Par16">The diffusion of innovations is determined by the consumers’ investment decisions, which in turn depend on the technological specifications of the appliances that are on the market (technology database) and the policy measures (Policy DB) that are in place. Each of these parameters is discussed in detail in the following.<UnorderedList Mark="Bullet">

                      <Para ID="Par17">Technology database: The technology database contains the technological specifications of the appliances including their lifetime, specific power in operation and stand-by mode, operation and stand-by hours and investment as well as maintenance costs. For the historical years, the data are collected from the Ecodesign documents, market research institutes and manufacturer data. The data are defined on an annual basis, such that technological innovation is reflected in the time that new, high-efficient appliances enter the market. Prices are determined based on the current price and learning curves derived from historical data. Due to a lack of empirical data, the stand-by and operation hours are assumed to remain constant over the projection time period.</Para>

                      <Para ID="Par18">Policy database: The policy database defines the policy measures that are in place. For residential appliances, the two most relevant policy measures are the Ecodesign directive and the Energy Labelling directive. The Energy Labelling directive influences the decision-making processes both at firm level and consumer level. For firms, Energy Labelling provides an incentive to develop and commercialize energy-efficient products. For consumers, Energy Labelling provides transparency regarding the electricity consumption, thus enabling consumers to take into account the total cost of ownership approach in their purchase decisions. The impact of Energy Labelling on the development of new technologies has been subject to an increasing number of studies in recent years (Edler <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2013</CitationRef>) (Schiellerup and Atanasiu <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2011</CitationRef>). Labelling policies have an effect on appliance manufacturers, whose direct innovation efforts towards the development of products in higher efficiency classes. The evidence suggests that the rate at which appliances with higher efficiency classes enter the market increases when Labelling policies are in place (PSI and BIOIS <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">2011</CitationRef>). In our modelling approach, the range of different options on the market is specified exogenously in the technology database. The assumption to what extent Labelling enhances the speed at which new appliances appear is therefore a critical input parameter that influences the evolution of electricity demand. Minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) are modelled by restricting the market share of new appliances starting in the year the standards come into force (Elsland et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2013</CitationRef>). In our modelling approach, MEPS are implemented by restricting the exogenously specified range of different options on the market. The Ecodesign and Labelling legislations are designed to act in a combined way, where Ecodesign “pushes” the lower end of the market, whereas Labelling “pulls” the higher end. Our modelling approach takes into account the interactions between the two policy measures, such that the total electricity savings calculated by the combined implementation of the two measures differ from the savings when implementing the measures in two consecutive runs of the model. Our results in the diffusion scenario therefore display the combined savings of Ecodesign and Labelling, taking into account their interactions.</Para>

                      <Para ID="Par19">Investment decision: Labelling has an influence on the investment decisions of consumers, directing preferences towards more energy-efficient devices (Bull <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2012</CitationRef>). Without Energy Labelling (or when most products have reached the highest Labelling class), consumers lack information about the life-cycle costs of appliances. A number of recent studies show that information on life-cycle costs has a significant effect on the investment decisions of consumers and contributes to lowering the implicit discount rates for residential appliances (Kaenzig and Wuestenhagen <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2009</CitationRef>; Consumer Focus <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2012</CitationRef>). The implementation of the investment decision process in FORECAST-Residential follows a multinomial logit-approach, where the market share <Emphasis Type="Italic">S</Emphasis>

For residential appliances, direct rebound effects include an increase in operation hours, appliance size (e.g. larger television screens) or ownership rate (e.g. installation of more lighting units).

The results show that for all end-uses, significant savings are achieved in the diffusion scenario. Without policy measures, electricity demand is expected to increase significantly. The diffusion of technologies as expected with current policy measures has a potential to significantly reduce electricity consumption with respect to the frozen innovation scenario. For information and communication technologies (ICT) and air conditioning, the increase in efficiency is outweighed by the increase in ownership, leading to a total increase in energy demand. This is partly due to the fact that the current implementations for ICT have typically lacked ambition, which in part may be explained by the fact that the legislative processes are rather long compared to the fast innovation dynamics. In the innovation scenario, additional savings are achieved for all end-uses, leading to an absolute decrease of electricity demand. While all end-uses show potentials for additional savings, the strongest increase is observed for new and other appliances (N&amp;O) and ICT.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig7">

              <Para ID="Par37">We investigated the impact of eco-innovations on the EU residential electricity demand (excluding heating) using a detailed bottom-up modelling approach considering a frozen efficiency scenario, diffusion scenario and an innovation scenario. In the diffusion scenario, the influence of the currently implemented policy measures that mainly support the diffusion of available technologies is estimated. In the innovation scenario, it is assumed that policy support for the development of new technologies is increased. We showed that significant savings can be achieved through the diffusion of currently available technologies. Further savings are achieved through the development of technologies with efficiencies beyond the status quo.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par38">We compared the expected electricity savings assuming a 10 % rebound effect and a 40 % rebound effect and find that the annual savings compared to the frozen efficiency scenario amount to 47 and 31 %, respectively. We conclude that while the rebound effect is important to be taken into account in policy design and evaluation, it does not justify inaction.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par39">From a methodological point of view, it is essential to further investigate the micro-level influence of policy measures and their interactions on the decision-making processes in order to increase the impact of policy measures on innovation. Furthermore, it is essential to gain further understanding of the impact of the policy mix on the development and commercialization of energy-efficient appliances, as well as its effect on the purchase prices.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par40">We conclude that the current policy support to diffuse energy efficiency technologies for residential electricity use provides an important contribution for reducing electricity demand. However, additional efforts to support the development of new technologies are required in order to achieve a long-term transition into a green economy.</Para>
