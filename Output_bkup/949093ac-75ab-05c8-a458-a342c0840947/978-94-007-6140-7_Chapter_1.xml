        <Body>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Applied demography is an ever-evolving field that is applicable to a number of disciplines (Siegel <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2002</CitationRef>; Murdock and Swanson <CitationRef CitationID="CR02">2008</CitationRef>). It is a subfield of basic demography, which is the study of human populations and the size, composition, and spatial distribution of these populations and the related processes of fertility, mortality, and migration. Unlike basic demography which is primarily concerned with increasing knowledge about how these processes lead to demographic change, the focus of applied demography is understanding the consequences of demographic change, including the related social and economic consequences and their application to decisions related to policy development, planning, the distribution of goods and services, etc. in a specific area (Murdock and Ellis <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1991</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Public health is about the health of the public – the population – not the health of individual members (Turnock <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2008</CitationRef>). The emphasis is on the public – on the population itself. Public health and demography have been intimately related for centuries; indeed, it is difficult to separate the two. Because the focus of public health practice is on the population, success or failure of public health efforts are measured with population level data – e.g., rates, ratios, life expectancy, etc. From the time John Graunt (<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">1662</CitationRef>) began analyzing vital statistics data in the mid-17th century to the present, demographers have made observations either directly or indirectly on the health of the population with death and birth statistics and measures based on these in conjunction with census and survey information. Demographers have contributed invaluably to public health through development of population estimates and projections and evaluations of the quality of these ­products. Without good quality estimates and projections, planning for public health services would be nearly impossible. Often, the denominators for public health measures come from work done by applied demographers. Likewise, persons whose primary interest was in public health have made invaluable contributions to demography. This does not mean that public health practice may not include individual level interventions – e.g., assigning nurses to educate new mothers in proper care of infants, immunization programs, etc. – but unlike medical practice, the emphasis is on the population, not on the individual.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In this volume, the usefulness of the methods of applied demography in addressing public health issues is illustrated. This volume is not a complete overview of applied demography and public health and their interrelations. It is a collection of papers that illustrate some of the ways that applied demography can be used to inform or support public health issues. It should also be pointed out that the chapters were not necessarily prepared with “customers” in mind; they originated as papers presented at professional meetings. The work originated in a session at the Applied Demography Conference held in San Antonio, Texas, in January 2010. Some papers from that session are included in the volume. In addition, authors of appropriate papers presented at the annual meeting of the Population Association of America in April 2010 were invited to contribute their work. All contributions were sent for independent review. The editors are grateful to the contributors and the reviewers for their hard work.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">This volume is intended for a wide range of users. Applied demographers, health policy makers, social epidemiologists, and social scientists or practitioners in the public and private sectors interested in public health can benefit from the information in this publication. In addition, this volume could be used as an accompanying text for courses in applied undergraduate and graduate demography and public health science courses. The authors’ papers provide a number of resources and tools that can be used by these persons in conducting research aimed at promoting public health: (1) information on a variety of health research datasets, (2) different statistical methodologies for analyzing health-related data and developing concepts related to health status, (3) methodologies for forecasting or projecting disease incidences and associated costs, and (4) discussion of demographic concepts used to measure population health status. Also important is the recurring theme of understanding how demographic and socioeconomic characteristics affect public health.</Para>

Utilizing the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 data, Fox and Hutto compare the likelihood of upward mobility by obesity status. According to Fox and Hutto, obesity dampens upward mobility and increases downward mobility for overweight women. The chapter by Gorrindo et al. looks at the cross-country comparison of sociodemographic correlates of depression. They use data from the WHO study on global aging and adult health to examine the extent which sociodemographic variables correlate to the depressive conditions across five countries: China, India, Ghana, Mexico, and South Africa.

Singh examines the burden of aging in terms of health expenditures in Kerala, the Indian state that has the highest proportion of elderly in India. Using methods of empirical analyses, the author found that the proportion of elderly having at least one ailment is much higher in Kerala compared to other Indian states and that per capita out-of-pocket health expenditure for non-elderly in-patient care is higher than that for the elderly. Based on the estimates the author predicted that the burden of managing the cost of diseases will increase significantly in coming future.</Para>
