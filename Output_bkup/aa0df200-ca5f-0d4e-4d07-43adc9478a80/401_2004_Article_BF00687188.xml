<Heading>Summary</Heading>
<Para>During the meeting of the IVth International Congress in Munich on 4–8 September, the status of neuropathology around the world was reviewed by the International Committee of Neuropathology, consisting of the Vice Presidents from 46 nations, with Professor<Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">Jacob</Emphasis> (of Germany) the Secretary-General. The review indicated that neuropathology flourishes in relatively few world centres and that in numerous other geographical areas neuropathology exists merely as a diagnostic service or is, in other ways, subsidiary to clinical departments. In still other areas the neuropathologist belongs to no school, but, like a waif, has to plot his own course.</Para>
<Para>Such conditions exist even though it is universally recognized that strength in neuropathology is a prerequisite to continuing advance in the medical sciences. The solution to the problem in those areas of the world in which neuropathology has little stimulus will come when it is recognized that neuropathology is a medical sicence in its own right and can be effectively prosecuted and attract the best minds only when the neuropathologist is provided ample opportunity and is accorded an academic status coequal with that of other major medical specialties. Among the neuropathologists' missions are (1) clinicopathological correlation, (2) clinicoanatomical correlation, and (3) basic research. These are the missions so effectively carried out years ago in Germany that established neuropathology as a major medical science.</Para>
<Para>The International Committee recognizes that in those countries expressing the desire for improvement in the status of neuropathology — whether through university or through governmental channels — the initial step in any ultimate solution is to have problems defined and needs ascertained. This survey is now underway. The Committee further recognizes that its primary concern should be in exploring ways and means whereby those desirous of entering a career in neuropathology can be adequately supported.</Para>
