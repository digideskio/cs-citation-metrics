              <Para>To study and forecast atmospheric tracer concentrations at ground level, an assimilation system is available around the LOTOS-EUROS model based on the Ensemble Kalman filter technique. For applications focusing on air-quality related to aerosols, the available observation data is usually limited to ground based observations of total PM2.5 or PM10, and model uncertainty is specified for the emissions. In this study, the key parameters of the assimilation system have been varied: the assumed temporal variation in the emission uncertainty, the amplitude of the representation error, the localization length of the analysis, the averaging period of the observations, and the number of ensemble members in the filter. Although in theory these parameters are all important, the most important parameters are those related to the representation error between simulations and observations.</Para>

              <Para>A data-assimilation system incorporates observations in model simulations. Independent of the chosen technique, the components of such a system are a simulation model with associated assumptions about the model error, observation data with associated observation errors, an observation representation operator with an assumption about the representation error, and an assimilation algorithm.</Para>
              <Para>In this study, the model simulations are provided by the LOTOS-EUROS model [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00341">1</CitationRef>]. The simulation domain is limited to an area in North-West Europe covering The Netherlands and the west part of Germany (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00341">34.1</InternalRef>). The model is configured to simulate concentrations of aerosols and trace gasses at a resolution of 25 km in this domain, during the month July 2008. The model is driven by meteorological fields from ECMWF, land cover information, and emissions from traffic, industry, and other anthropogenic sources. These emissions are considered the most uncertain input for the simulation of aerosols, and uncertainty is specified in terms of a standard deviation and a temporal correlation. A part of the observed aerosol load is of unknown origin and is therefore not represented in the model; a bias-correction factor accounts for the missing aerosol when simulating total PM concentrations. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00341">

              <Para>Observations of aerosol at ground level are available from the AIRBASE database. The model is expected to provide simulations representative for rural background sites; the locations of these sites in the domain are shows in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00341">34.1</InternalRef> too. The sites used here all measure the total fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) aerosol load at hourly resolution. The observation operator to simulate these observation from the model state simply extracts the concentrations from the lowest grid cell in which the site is located. A representation error is assumed with a standard deviation equal to a fraction of the observed value, which also accounts for the instrumental error.</Para>
              <Para>The assimilation system is based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter approach and is described in detail in Timmermans et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00342">2</CitationRef>]. In this method, an ensemble of model states is propagated in time where the spread originates from the emission uncertainty. Whenever observations are available, the ensemble is contracted in the neighborhood of the observation site, taking into account the representation uncertainty.</Para>

              <Heading>Sensitivity Experiments</Heading>
              <Para>The assimilation system contains a number of parameters that are highly uncertain but strongly determine the results. Their value is often set by trial-and-error analysis, since no other information on the best value is available. The sensitivity of the result to these parameters is evaluated by changing their value and determine the impact on the results in terms of difference between observations and analyzed ensemble mean.</Para>
              <Para>The sensitivity to the emission uncertainty was examined by varying the assumed temporal correlation; the amplitude of the uncertainty has a constant high value of 40 %. A stronger temporal correlation limits the hour-to-hour variation in the emissions, but leads to a broader ensemble on long term since each member is able to build up a different emission region. For the later reason, the assimilation system is better able to follow an episode of high PM values.</Para>
              <Para>A smaller representation error assigns more weight to the observations. This will contract the ensemble mean more in the direction of the observations, as long as this is in agreement with the spatial variations in the ensemble In the current application, with a rather homogeneous domain (urbanized areas) and observation sites not too close to each other, the difference between simulations and observations is quite homogeneous. Especially during an episode of high PM values a smaller representation error therefore improves the results. This suggests that the assumption of a representation error standard deviation being a constant fraction of the observed value needs a re-formulation</Para>
              <Para>The observations could be assimilated hourly or at longer time steps by taking average values. If for example daily averages are assimilated, the ensemble is propagated during a longer time period and is able to build up more uncertainty. The hourly simulations are stored in the ensemble too, and are changed following the analysis of the averages. The sensitivity runs showed that preferably the averaging interval should be as small as possible. If the difference between model and simulations is rather constant then increasing the averaging interval does not improve the results. If the difference is time depended however, for example too low during the day and too low during the night, then increasing the averaging interval leads to larger difference between observations and ensemble mean.</Para>
              <Para>The localization length scale determines the size of the region around an observation site when the ensemble is analyzed. This localization is necessary to let spurious correlations in the ensemble not have impact on the results. Since the uncertainty added to the emissions is part of the ensemble state too, a larger length scale changes emissions in a larger region around the sites. The impact of the localization length is not unambiguous. In regions where the difference between model and simulations is rather homogenous, a longer localization length improves the assimilation results (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00342">34.2</InternalRef>). In regions where differences occur due to other reasons than a simple increase or decrease of emissions, the results get worse for longer length scale. This result suggests that the localization length requires a regional value, determined by the spatial correlation in the observed differences between simulations and observations. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00342">

              <Para>The final parameter tested was the ensemble size. In general, a bigger ensemble is needed if the spatial covariance’s are more complicated. In the current application, with a rather homogenous uncertainty defined for the emissions, and a domain dominated by similar urbanized areas, the error structure is rather simple. A small ensemble size of about 20 member was sufficient to provide stable results. The largest impact of this parameter is seen for the ensemble spread, which quantifies the assumed accuracy of the result; the ensemble mean is quickly insensitive for the ensemble size.</Para>

              <Para>The Ensemble Kalman Filter technique used to assimilate PM observations with simulations from the LOTOS-EUROS model is most sensitive to parameters related to the analysis of observations. Sensitivity experiments showed that the representation error, the averaging interval, and the localization length have the strongest impact on the results. In general, the averaging interval should be as small as possible. For the representation error and the localization length the results are not unambiguous and suggest that their values should not be set globally but individually per station or region, or per episode. Analysis of the structure difference between observation and simulations should lead to proper choices for these parameters.</Para>
