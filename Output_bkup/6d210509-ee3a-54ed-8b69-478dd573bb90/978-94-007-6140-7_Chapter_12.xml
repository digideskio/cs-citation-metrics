              <Heading>Survey of Women in Reproductive Ages</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">This survey instrument consisted of a total of 16 questions—name, age, current marital status, number of pregnancies, number of live births, number of children living at present, persons seeking assistance from health workers/professionals for delivering babies (information collected by children’s birth order), reasons for not seeking such assistance, status of receiving prenatal care for pregnancies, and from whom, reasons for not seeking such assistance, number of sisters ever had and those surviving, details of deceased sisters, number of sisters dying for maternal causes, perceptions of seriousness of problems of maternal health, and opinions related to common threats of maternal health during and after pregnancy in their region. The questionnaire maintained a balance between open-­ended and close-ended questions to optimize the level of difficulty and time required on the respondents’ part in providing the information solicited. Only one woman per household participated in the survey.</Para>

              <Heading>Data Analysis</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A total of 277 women in reproductive ages (13–49) participated in the survey (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">12.1</InternalRef>). One interview in which the woman was reportedly 55 years old was eliminated from the analysis. While 269 women reported an average age of 27.4 ± 0.54 years, the remaining eight respondents said <Emphasis Type="Italic">adult age</Emphasis> without specifying their exact age. While this response made them eligible to participate in the survey, it prevented them to be included in any particular age group. Secondly, only 4 women were 13 or 14 years old and the remaining 265 were in the age group of 15–49 years. Ninety percent of women split equally between <Emphasis Type="Italic">never married</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">currently married</Emphasis> categories and the remaining 10% were <Emphasis Type="Italic">widowed</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">divorced</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">or separated</Emphasis>. However, 75% of never married women reported one or more (up to 8) live births (the corresponding percentages were 95 for married women and 96% for widowed, divorced, or separated women). Thus, it can be surmised that it is common for Liberian women to have children without getting married.

                </Footnote> Although the survey did not collect information on age at death of each child, a high rate of child mortality is indicated when the number of children living at present is compared with the number of live births—there is an average loss of 0.4932 ± 0.056 (range 0–6) ­children. Looking differently, 276 women reported a total of 936 pregnancies, 751 live births, and 615 children living at present—resulting in the finding of a loss of 185 pregnancies before they turn into live births and a loss of 136 children after they were born. This is an indication of serious risk to child health as well as maternal health among this population. In fact, 47% of the respondents perceived that maternal health is a <Emphasis Type="Italic">very serious</Emphasis> problem and another 42% perceived it as <Emphasis Type="Italic">somewhat serious</Emphasis> problem. Only 11% said it was not a serious problem (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">12.2</InternalRef>).

              <Para TextBreak="No">The risks of child health and maternal health may further be substantiated from what the respondents had to say about their dead sisters. The average age of dead sisters, as recalled by 67 respondents, was 26.5 ± 1.9 (range 17–42) years; the average duration of marriage (n = 40) was 5.7 ± 0.8 (range 1–9) years; the average number of children ever born (n = 64) was 3.5 ± 0.43 (range 1–7); and the average number of children currently living (n = 62) was 2.3 ± 0.34 (range 0–5). A total of 132 sisters were reported to be dead; 29 (22%) of them had died for maternal causes (abortion, labor, and postpartum infection) and 54 (42%) for non-maternal causes (malaria, heart failure, typhoid, cholera, and anemia). The cause of death was unknown for the remaining 49 (36%) (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">12.3</InternalRef>). Labor among maternal causes (19/29 or 66%) and malaria among non-maternal causes (24/54 or 44%) were leading causes of death. Heart failure was the second most leading non-maternal cause of death, ­contributing for 14 out of 54 deaths (26%).

              <Heading>Estimating Maternal Mortality by Sisterhood Method</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The sisterhood method is an indirect technique for deriving survey-based estimates of maternal mortality in high-fertility populations. It substantially reduces sample size requirements because it obtains information by interviewing ­respondents about the survival of all their adult sisters (see for example, World Health Organization <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">2005</CitationRef>). Graham et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">1989</CitationRef>) developed the sisterhood method from the key simplification of the basic sibling survivorship technique of Hill and Trussell (<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">1977</CitationRef>) and published their first field trial results from the Gambia data in 1989. The rationale for this method is based on several principles: first, it assumes that a relationship exists between the number of siblings and their survival probabilities, especially when the questions were restricted to siblings who have survived at least to the point of entry to the adult age groups; second, the number of households that need to be visited in order to obtain information on large numbers of women who reached reproductive age is relatively small, given the average family sizes in high-fertility societies of the developing countries; third, in many of these populations, siblings remain in close contact long after they have left their natal home; fourth, the circumstances of a death of an adult sister would be highly memorable, even when the date and age of death may be forgotten; and finally, sisters may assist each other in the later stages of pregnancy, at the time of childbirth, or during the period immediately following delivery. This rationale convinced us to interview only the women in reproductive ages rather than both genders.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">This method uses the proportions of adult sisters dying during pregnancy, childbirth, or the puerperium reported by adults during the survey to derive maternal mortality ratio. Over the last 18 years (i.e. since the method was developed), this technique was applied in many studies and several evaluations of its reliability were undertaken (Rutenberg and Sullivan <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">1991</CitationRef>; Walraven et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">1994</CitationRef>; Wirawan and Linnan <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">1994</CitationRef>; Amowitz <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2002</CitationRef>). The major advantages of this method include its minimal data requirements, analytical simplicity, and lower sample size requirements (Graham <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">1994</CitationRef>; Daniel et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">1996</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The method provides a framework for both data collection and data analysis. Four simple questions are asked: (1) How many sisters (born to the same mother) have you ever had who were ever-married (including those who are now dead)? (2) How many of these ever-married sisters are alive now? (3) How many of these ­ever-married sisters are dead? (4) How many of these dead sisters died while they were pregnant, or during childbirth, or during 6 weeks after the end of pregnancy? While these questions provide guidance as to what information needs to be solicited in order to estimate maternal mortality in a given region by using the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Sisterhood Method</Emphasis>, it raises concerns, at least in our case, in terms of the accuracy of the information that respondents could provide for such broad questions (especially the first three), and most importantly, in terms of sensitivity for a lost family member (which may result in frequent refusals or underreporting). Therefore, we have modified these questions in the following manner:

                </Footnote> As shown in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">12.2</InternalRef>, the LTR for women in the survey region in Liberia was 0.082905, i.e., 1 in every 12 women who reached reproductive age (defined as 15 years) died during pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium. A total of 132 participants’ sister deaths were reported, and 29 of them (22%) were attributed to maternal causes. The estimated MMR was 1,366/100,000 live-births. These estimates are comparable to the national level for Liberia.<Footnote ID="Fn6">
                  <Para TextBreak="No">The WHO estimates in 2000 for Liberia were: LTR = 1 in 16; MMR = 760 with an uncertainty range from 190 to 1,400 (see <Emphasis Type="Italic">World Health Organization</Emphasis>

Considering that health professionals’ perceptions of probability of maternal death are confined to those who are attended by them, one can expect a higher probability when mothers who are unattended or who are attended by untrained persons (e.g. zoe, TBA) are included in the sample. Thus, the LTR of 8% seems to be an accurate estimate.</Para>

              <Heading>Self-Vulnerability, Causes and Solutions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In response to the question, <Emphasis Type="Italic">In general, what is the most common cause(s) of mothers in this region to suffer during or after pregnancy and what do you suggest to improve the health of these mothers</Emphasis>, women indicated a high level of self-vulnerability due to lack of money; lack of a healthcare facility in their vicinity; ignorance of their conditions of health; spread of common diseases like cholera, malaria, typhoid; and frequently, unskilled/untrained health workers experimenting on them. They all requested affordable (if not totally free) health care services, establishment of local/community health clinics, and training for the unskilled health workers like zoes, untrained midwifes, and traditional birth attendants with education for women about their health risks, nutritional facts, and the importance of regular visits to clinics and following health professionals’ advice including taking medication as recommended. Here is a representation of statements the respondents made:
<BlockQuote>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">I am a typical example of mothers or women suffering after pregnancy because I drink herbs and rubbed chalk throughout my pregnancy until I gave birth. This practice does not mean well for us because I am presently experiencing the negative of these herbs and chalk that I was taking. So I will like to advice that enough awareness be done in our area so as to enable us use the clinic or nearby health center, although it is a distance. I am also urging the national government through the health ministry to see reason to build for us a health center in our community.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Most common cause of mothers’ suffering during or after pregnancy is severe stomach pain, which come as the result of untrained midwife attending to mothers. Malaria and body pain are also some common causes encountered by mothers. I request that trained medical doctors should be sent in our areas.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">From where I come from we don’t know about medical care. All we do is to seek our native doctors and pray to God for good health until the child is born. I suggest that trained doctors/nurses go into these regions and educate our people about prenatal care/medical care. This will stop the complications, which most women are faced with during pregnancy.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Many young girls get pregnant and abort because of no support. After aborting plenty, it can stop you from bearing sometimes. One common problem is swollen feet. Malaria can cause serious problems. It can even destroy pregnancy. I suggest that contraceptives, pills be free like condoms too. Secondly, young girls should be given businesses and scholarships to help them start supporting themselves.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">No clinic here. Don’t know what to do if we get sick while pregnant. We only see country doctor who will sometimes tell us to go to the hospital, and the distance is so far and no money. Therefore we sometimes have serious problems that pregnant women even die.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Common causes are urinary tract infection, sexually transmitted infections, malaria, anemia, and postpartum hemorrhage. Suggestions: trained health workers be sent to the rural communities and they should be encouraged to spend longer times with these communities.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">These mothers should go to trained doctors, nurses, and good midwife. Seeking good medical care at hospital. You have to train the mothers and educate them well.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Most common cause is due to nurses poorly trained, they don’t know how to take care of people because only small schools they can attend. I suggest that students should go to college and good schools to learn more before doing work in hospital, clinic or home.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">When pregnant, giving birth outside of the hospital is a problem, not taking vaccines. Women should be taught to visit hospital through radio programs, workshops and field work. Reduce the fees.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Weak back, low blood and lack of transportation. I suggest that the hospital fees should be reduced and the women be educated about their health.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Lack of nutritional status, lack of medical attention are common in this region. In order to improve the health of these mothers training should be provided and teach women on what kinds of food to eat during pregnancy. More health centers should be provided so that women can be assessed and know some of the risk factors during and after pregnancy.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Three questions were posed to respondents: <Emphasis Type="Italic">Do you regularly keep the records of the pregnant women to whom you provide services? If yes, how many pregnant women did you serve in the last 1-year? Of all the pregnant women you served, how many were successful deliveries? (That is, both mother and child surviving after delivery)</Emphasis>. In response to these questions, 28 (of the 170 providers of maternal health services) said they would not keep records of pregnant women they serve, and the remaining 142 replied that they keep such records. The number of pregnant women they served varied from as low as two women to as many as 4,480 with an average of 228 women in the last year. The number of successful cases in which both mother and child survived after delivery varied from 1 to 4,240 with an average of 185 cases. Thus, the crude success rate is 81 per 100 pregnant women. It is important to see how this risk is distributed by the size of the organization. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab6">12.6</InternalRef> shows the number of pregnant women served, number of successful cases, and resulting success rates by the size of the organization.

              <Para TextBreak="No">As the above table shows the success rates vary significantly by the size of organizations—that is, it decreases from large to medium moderately, but decreases drastically from medium to small. This large difference may be because of excessive patient turnover, understaffing, inadequate follow-ups due to the nature of 8 h workdays and closings on weekends, lack of equipment to handle last minute emergencies, and/or lack of medical attention right from the beginning of gestation.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">What about the provider’s knowledge, experience and skill? Do some professionals ensure better success rate than others? Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab7">12.7</InternalRef> provides the success rates by providers’ position/rank. While screeners reported highest success rates (95.1), ‘others’ (consisting of Screeners/OICs (Office in-charge), bedside nurses, college seniors, nurse aides, supervisors, traditional birth attendants, assistant midwives, coordinator, student nurses, student midwives, etc.) demonstrated the lowest success rate of 67.8. Screeners may have a better understanding about the conditions of the pregnant women they serve and persons in the latter group may lack such ability because of inadequate experience (especially for students) and other administrative distractions (especially for OICs, supervisors, and nurse directors). Physician Assistants also showed a relatively low success rate of 77.1. The success rates of both midwives and RNs were above the success level of the total sample, although midwives had an edge over RNs (89.8 vs. 84.4).

              <Para TextBreak="No">In order to determine the significance of the observed differences in success rates by organizational size, providers’ position/rank, and experience, a three-­way analysis of variance was conducted. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab8">12.8</InternalRef> indicates that not only do these three variables have a significant effect on success rates independently (main affects), they can also affect the outcome jointly (2-way and 3-way interactions). That means, for example, a student nurse or student midwife working at a small organization can have a lower success rate than he/she would at a medium or large organization. Therefore, it is imperative to have high ranking and highly experience professionals at smaller organizations in order to have higher success rates. Finally, these three variables accounted for an R<Superscript>2</Superscript> value of 0.878—which means, 87.8% of variance in success rates can be explained by these three variables alone.

Perceived maternal mortalities based on these probabilities are shown in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab9">12.9</InternalRef>: 23% responded that no one had died,10% said less than 3% of women they had served had died, nearly 27% felt 3–5% had died, 10% said that 5–10% had died, and yet 3% believed as many as 10–20% had died.

              <Para TextBreak="No">In order to determine what these perceptions might have been based upon, a correlation analysis was conducted between each respondent’s perceived maternal mortality (pmmr) and four possible correlates: his/her reported success rate (success), organizational size (size), professional experience (experience), and position/rank (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab10">12.10</InternalRef>). Interestingly, neither zero-order nor partial correlations showed significant association between perceived maternal mortality and success rate. However, perceived maternal mortality is significantly associated with organizational size, professional experience, and position/rank. In other words, lower maternal mortality rates are likely to be perceived by those affiliated with large organizations, those with longer experience, and those employed as RNs and Midwives. Since these same three factors were found to be significantly associated with success rate earlier, it is possible that success rate may not be directly associated with an individual’s perceptions but is predicated through its determinants.

The larger mean values are associated with lower ratings, implying that health professionals observed them among fewer cases and vice versa. In addition to these direct causes, <Emphasis Type="Italic">harmful traditional practices during delivery, such as putting a cook-spoon in the mouth of the pregnant woman in labor and setting of mortar on the lady’s stomach to push the baby out, distance from healthcare center, lack of vehicle to transport pregnant woman to a major hospital in case of emergency, poor nutrition, and preexisting health conditions</Emphasis> are specified as indirect causes of maternal mortality.

                <Heading>What Should Health Professionals Dealing with Pregnant Women Know?</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Many respondents advocated the need for health professionals to establish an ongoing relationship with their patients (along with their spouses, if possible) and to gain knowledge of their health conditions and history. Respondents also stressed the importance of treating each patient on a case-by-case basis instead of handling them as a routine procedure. For example a Registered Nurse Midwife-OB Supervisor at a large organization stated:
<BlockQuote>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">All health workers should be able to know about their clients as well as their husbands. They should be able to establish nurse-patient relationship between them and their clients. They should be able to make their clients to build confidence and trust in them in order for them (clients) to be able to explain their problems to them. The health worker should teach their clients about the importance of visiting the prenatal clinic regularly and on taking the medication given them while attending the prenatal clinic. All health workers dealing with pregnant women should know which drugs to give their clients per trimester. They should not conceal any problem pertaining to the pregnancy from the clients and her husband. They should learn to visit their clients as well. They should teach them how to care for themselves and their babies. The best way to make them understand these things is to health educate them and conduct workshop for them as well.</Para>
                  </BlockQuote>
                </Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Another Registered Nurse from a large organization emphasized:
<BlockQuote>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">All health professionals who deal with pregnant women should know that all women are different and respond to pregnancy changes differently. Also, they should know that the cultural beliefs of pregnant women are very important to them although they may not be true. They are deeply rooted into the lifestyle of these women. They should therefore handle such beliefs with caution if they want these women to open up and be responsive to them.</Para>
                  </BlockQuote>
                </Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Some focused on the job knowledge and skill levels on the part of health professionals themselves. The following statement by a Midwife from the medium organization illustrates this angle:
<BlockQuote>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">They should know all about OB and GYN from start to end. They should be well educated because nursing is not guessing. They should know how to measure FHT, Fundal height, fetus lie, presenting part, detect weak back, etc. They should know how to prescribe drugs. They should know how to do deliveries and how to handle complications. They should know teamwork and how to transfer complications very early. To help them understand, schools need to really teach them. Also small size workshops for health workers will help those who ar3e working to understand too.</Para>

                </Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A Traditional Birth Attendant from a small organization echoed along the same lines:
<BlockQuote>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">They should know how to keep some money for assisting pregnant women, who can’t afford; how to do correct prenatal assessment; know the kinds of exercise pregnant women should take, especially those whose babies are not lying down good; know how to measure pregnancy and how to listen to the baby heart sound; know how to deliver babies good; how to cut and tie the cord, how to check the placenta, how to suction the baby; how to check women well; they should know that their materials should always be kept clean; and they should know how to record the birth records on the health cards.</Para>

                <Heading>What Do Health Professionals Think Women in Reproductive Ages Should Know?</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Health professionals opined that pregnant women, in general, should learn the importance of regular health clinic visits and checkups, following medical advice, taking preventive care and medication, avoiding risky methods of delivery, practicing safe-sex methods, and maintaining close and honest communication with the health professionals. The following quotations are from health professionals’ responses that illustrate these views.
<BlockQuote>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">Adult women should know that regular hospital or clinic visitation is essential, this will help in early detection/diagnosis of future problem and can be properly managed. Example, spontaneous abortion, post-partum hemorrhage, pre-eclempsia vaccination and proper prenatal routine drugs absence, which may sometimes lead to irreversible conditions. Adult women should be made to know that during pregnancy certain foods are essential for a healthy mother and baby or drugs for some infections that occur in pregnancy that may progress in to other problems if not treated properly. It is a risk for a previous C-section to attempt to do a home delivery. A healthy mother and child after delivery fully depend on full cooperation of the women listening to professional advice.</Para>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">They should know about malnutrition, sexually transmitted infection, risks involved delivering the child vaginally in abnormal cases and ways to avoid, nutritional education, and following health professionals’ advice.</Para>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">Women of reproductive age need to know about the deadly disease, HIV/AIDS and how to protect themselves from contracting it. They should know about abstinence, being faithful to a single sex partner, and about the use of condoms.</Para>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">They should learn the importance of vaccination to avoid polio babies and tetanus. They should always go to a hospital or clinic and stop buying medicines from the street.</Para>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">All adult women in this region should know the risk of not taking family planning, and refusing to take vaccines during pregnancy.</Para>
                    <Para TextBreak="No">…risk of not attending pre-natal clinic, poor hygiene, and the intake of harmful drugs.</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The findings of this study are consistent with other national studies. For example, we estimated the maternal mortality at the national level to be at 1,366 per 100,000 live-births and crude success rate (i.e., the survival rate of both mother and child after delivery) at 81 per 100 pregnant women. These estimates are in the acceptable range of the 2005 statistics reported by the World Health Organization: 1,200 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births and 66 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births (World Health Organization <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2008</CitationRef>). The 2006–2007 Liberia Demographic and Health Survey showed a 71% increase in maternal mortality compared to its earlier survey in 1999–2000 (Liberia Institute for Statistics and Geo-information Services <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2007</CitationRef>). The Integrated Regional Information Networks (<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2008</CitationRef>), a website maintained by the humanitarian news and analysis service of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, reported that the increase in maternal mortality since the end of Liberia’s civil war in 2003 was due to the near “non-existent” healthcare system. Along the lines of our survey findings, the Integrated Regional Information Networks also reported that: (1) doctors say the most common cause of death is vaginal hemorrhaging following childbirth, and (2) fewer births are being attended by trained medical professionals, the number of which declined through the end of the 1990–2003 war. Moreover, a wealth of the first-hand anecdotal information included herein from the reproductive mothers as well as from health professionals pertaining to risks and challenges they routinely encounter underscores the importance of maternal health. Maternal mortality in post-war Liberia is at an all time high, and it is imperative that efforts are made to develop the capacity of health practitioners assigned to rural clinics and health centers in order to deliver better services to these most marginalized communities as they struggle to recover from two decades of war.</Para>
