          <Para TextBreak="No">There is need for measures to contain food demand by a rapidly increasing world population that topped seven billion in 2012 and is expected to grow to 8.3 billion by 2050 and 10.9 billion by 2100. A combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world is envisioned to pose a stark challenge to the agricultural sector over and above the challenges from climate change, bio-energy and land degradation. Southern Africa experiences one of the highest climate variability in the world; a variability that negatively impacts on food security particularly at the level of small-scale agricultural producers. Thus, globally, and more so in Southern Africa, more focused investments have to be directed towards research that would mitigate impacts of climatic variability and climate change as well as stabilize food supply and enhance food security while mitigating malnutrition. Eradicating extreme hunger and poverty depends on improving agriculture and enacting policies that support small-scale agricultural producers’ productivity and strengthening food processing and fortification.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">The world population reached the seven billion mark predicted by the USCB that the world population would exceed the seven billion in March 12, 2012. However, according to a separate estimate by the UN Population Fund it reached this milestone at the end of October 2011. The world population has grown steadily since the end of the 1350 when it was estimated at around 370 million. The highest growth rates were experienced during the 1950s and for a longer period during the 1960s and 1970s. The growth rate peaked at 2.2 % in 1963, and then declined to below 1.1 % by 2012. Current UN projections show the global population is expected to reach between 8.3 and 10.9 billion by 2050 (<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">Wikipedia</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">According to the 2008 revision of the official United Nations population estimates and projections, the world population was projected to reach seven billion early in 2012, up from the 6.9 billion. At the time, the UN projections showed a continued increase in population with the global population expected to reach between 8.3 and 10.9 billion by 2050. Most of the increase was projected to be in developing countries whose population was projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050. This increase was projected to be distributed among the population aged 15–59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion). The population of developed countries was expected to increase slightly from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion. This would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries which was expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. It is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that was envisioned to pose a stark challenge to sustainability because, as always, population growth has a marked influence on levels of consumption and the efficiency of resource use (FAO <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2009a</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">On the other hand, new estimates based on the 2012 revision of the official United Nations population estimates and projections, the world population of 7.2 billion in mid-2013 is projected to increase by almost one billion people within the next twelve years, reaching 8.1 billion in 2025, and to further increase to 9.6 billion in 2050 and 10.9 billion by 2100. These results are based on the assumption that there will be a decline of fertility for countries where large families are still prevalent as well as a slight increase of fertility in several countries with fewer than two children per woman on average (UN <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In the new revision, the estimated total fertility rate for 2005–2010 has increased in several countries, including by more than 5 % in 15 high-fertility countries from sub-Saharan Africa. It is also assumed that future levels of life expectancy at birth will be slightly higher in several countries in sub-Sahara Africa and other developing countries. Longer survival, like higher fertility, generates larger populations. Almost all of the additional 3.7 billion people from 2013 to 2100 will enlarge the population of developing countries, which is projected to rise from 5.9 billion in 2013 to 8.2 billion in 2050 and to 9.6 billion in 2100. Growth is expected to be particularly dramatic in the least developed countries of the world such as those in sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia. In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to change minimally, passing from 1.25 billion in 2013 to 1.28 billion in 2100, and would decline were it not for the net increase due to migration from developing to developed countries, which is projected to average about 2.4 million persons annually from 2013 to 2050 and 1 million from 2050 to 2100 (UN <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Out of the six permanently inhabited continents, Asia is the most populous with its 4.3 billion inhabitants accounting for 60.31 % of the world population. China and India being the most-populated countries in Asia; together their populations constitute about 37 % of the world’s population. The second most-populated continent is Africa with around one billion people, or 15 % of the world’s population. Europe’s population of 733 million people makes up 11 % of the world’s population while the Latin American and Caribbean regions are home to around 600 million or 9 % of world population. USA and Canada’s population of around 352 million accounts for 5 % of world’s total population while Oceania, the least-populated region, has about 35 million inhabitants or 0.5 % of world’s population. Antarctica though not permanently populated, has a small, fluctuating international population, based mainly in polar science stations with summer months recording being higher than winter months (UN <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Agriculture is the backbone of most of the economies in Southern Africa employing over 70 % of the population. Agricultural production and associated processing industries form the major economic sector of most countries in the region. Agriculture supports the main livelihood systems of the rural population and like in the rest of the developing countries; farmers constitute the largest group of natural resource managers. Worldwide, agriculture is expected to feed the increased population that is projected to number 9.1 billion in 2050, while providing income, employment and environmental services (FAO <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2009a</CitationRef>). According to the same report, this requirement poses a great challenge to world’s farmers over and above the challenges from climate change, bio-energy and land degradation. These challenges pose enormous pressure on the agricultural sector to provide food, feed and fiber as well as income, employment and other essential ecosystem services. Making meaningful investments and introducing effective changes to agricultural production systems is a key means of meeting these challenges.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The agricultural sector will require a great deal of modification and adaptation to unavoidable changing climate and dwindling ecosystem resources in order to ensure food security and sustainable development. Most developing countries, those in Southern Africa included will need to embrace change and adapt to climate change. To ensure success, these countries will have to encompass the improvement of land productivity of small-scale agricultural producers by assisting them to adapt to climate change. To embrace methodologies that will lead to an increase in the levels of soil organic matter, of which carbon is the main component. This would translate into better plant nutrient content, increased water retention capacity and better structure, eventually leading to higher yields and greater resilience. While restoration of organic soils enables greater sequestration of carbon in soil, it may reduce the amount of land available for food production. However, according to some researchers, these options can be pursued in the context of, and without adverse affects to, national sustainable development processes (FAO <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">2009b</CitationRef>).</Para>

          <Heading>Food Security</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The World Food Summit in 1996 adopted the following definition of food security: “Food security exists when all people at all times have physical or economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (FAO <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">1996</CitationRef>). FAO’s State of Food Insecurity report (<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2002</CitationRef>) refers to four elements of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilization and food system stability. Availability focuses on food production whereas accessibility focuses on the ability of people to obtain food, either through production, purchase or transfers. Food utilization focuses on the nutritional value of food, the interaction with physiological condition and food safety while food system stability focuses on stability of supply and access, as well as the ability to respond to food emergencies.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In FAO’s <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2008</CitationRef> State of Food Insecurity report, it is stated that there are nearly one billion people who are undernourished. In this report, it is shown that the overall proportion of the population suffering from undernourishment in sub-Saharan Africa remains persistently high at an average of 30 % but is over 50 % in some of the countries. In this report, it is also stated that undernourishment affects more than a fifth of the population of South Asia (21 %), and many Caribbean countries (23 %). The report goes on to show that food accessibility for many people in developing countries remained closely tied to local food production; the report stressed the importance of agriculture-led growth to increase incomes and reduce poverty and food insecurity in developing countries. Efforts to improve agricultural productivity that will increase farmer incomes can drive demand in other important economic sectors. This dynamic increases economic growth while providing the opportunity to simultaneously lift millions of people out of poverty. The World Bank has calculated that growth in the agriculture sector is 2.5 times as effective at reducing poverty compared to growth in other sectors. More recent research shows that, in sub-Saharan Africa, growth in agriculture is 11 times more effective at poverty reduction than in other sectors (World Bank <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">2007</CitationRef>; Christiansen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Elsewhere it is reported that countries with large food insecure populations are often also those whose agricultural systems are highly vulnerable to climate shocks particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia (Gregory et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2005</CitationRef>). Due to the close correlation between local production and food insecurity documented in the FAO reports, investments in the agricultural sector that increase food availability and strengthen the resilience of the food production systems were recommended. Such investments are envisaged to have the capacity to produce immediate positive impacts on all elements of food security in food insecure regions (FAO <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">2009b</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Investing in the development and maintenance of fishing systems is one viable intervention that can combat food insecurity among many communities across the world. Globally, over 500 million people depend, directly or indirectly, on fisheries and aquaculture for their livelihoods. Fish also provides essential nutrition for three billion people and at least 50 % of animal protein and essential minerals to 400 million people in the poorest countries. However, frequent and intense and extreme weather events are likely to adversely affect this dependable source of food and nutrition for the fishing communities and other members of a society that cannot afford other sources of protein. The income of fishing communities also stands to be adversely affected making malnutrition common place for those who were just getting by prior to the extreme weather events. In Southern Africa the challenge is formidable for coastal and lake regions where over-fishing and poor management of the fisheries are common. Strategies to increase resilience and adaptive capacity require wide-scale implementation and adoption of measures and practices that adhere to the principles of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Thus integrated farming systems are essential in overcoming food insecurity; systems that promote recycling and reuse of farm products. For example integrating aquaculture within broader farming practices will provide further opportunities, for example sludge produced during the treatment of aquaculture wastewater or pond sediments can be used to fertilize agricultural crops and crop residues such as cabbage leaves and other leafy vegetables can be used as fish feed thus reducing the cost of raising fish in small-scale ponds. Similarly responsible mariculture farming systems that include filter-feeders and seaweeds are excellent production systems as they require little external inputs and can thus be practiced by low income communities; they also provide ecosystem services such as filtering and absorbing excess nutrients in boosting water quality and minimize algal blooms. Moreover, seaweeds can be used for feed, food and cosmetic products and have the potential for bio-fuel production.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The farming of seaweeds, oysters and clams constitute the largest proportion of mariculture production worldwide. The farming of seaweeds has expanded rapidly in recent decades as demand has outstripped the supply available from natural resources. Seaweeds, such as <Emphasis Type="Italic">kappaphycus alvarezii</Emphasis> and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Eucheuma denticulatum</Emphasis>, originally harvested from natural stocks are now cultivated in some of the countries in Southern Africa such as in Zanzibar, Tanzania where it generates income for small-scale farming communities. Another viable system that can be practiced by small-scale farmers is aqua-silviculture where the integration of aquaculture and mangrove forestry is practiced. Although not yet widely practiced in Southern Africa, the potential is very high for countries such as Tanzania and Mozambique where mangrove swamps are a source of shrimps and crabs that support many small fishing communities along the coastal belt.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Aqua-silviculture system involves the integration of mangrove ponds and pens for fish and crabs (Primavera <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2000</CitationRef>). A good example where this system has registered success is that practiced in the Tambak region of Java where an area of over 300,000 ha which lacked mangroves is a well known location of extensive ponds which boosted yields and led into substantial improvements to socio-economic well-being of the rural population after mangroves were introduced (Sukardjo <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">1989</CitationRef>). Other appropriate interventions that improve the nutritional level of nutrient poor traditional foods such as cassava are called for in increasing food security for the small-scale farming communities in Southern Africa. Such interventions are discussed in Chap. <ExternalRef>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Southern Africa experiences one of the highest climate variability in the world. This variability has negative impacts on food security, especially at the level of small-scale agricultural producers (Mellaart <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2006</CitationRef>; Moeletsi et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2011</CitationRef>). While climate variability, often characterized by extreme weather events like El Nino and La Nina which lead to droughts and floods cannot be avoided, their effects can be mitigated through intensive research on how different climate scenarios affect crop production in the region. Thus, globally, and more so in Southern Africa, more focused investments have to be directed towards research that addresses the impacts of climatic variability; research aimed at helping small-scale agricultural producers to cope with agro-climatic risks that are projected to escalate due to the effects of global warming and climate change.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">High percentage (about 75 %) of the projected growth in crop production in developing countries comes from yield growth and only 16 % from increases in cropping intensity. Some predictions show that productivity of many important staple crops could decline by 2030 in high food insecure regions, particularly in Southern Africa and South Asia where large decreases in agricultural production are projected after 2050 even without the impacts of climate change (Lobell et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2008</CitationRef>). Continued land degradation and water scarcity will have major negative impacts on future agricultural productivity because salinization of soils, nutrient depletion and soil erosion all reduce the productivity of lands used for agricultural production. Many developing countries are already vulnerable to weather shocks, and without significant investments in agriculture, future climate changes will increase this vulnerability (Parry et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2007</CitationRef>). Thus, increasing the resilience of agricultural systems is a key means of adapting to climate change as well as increasing food security. Called for also are changes in agricultural technology aimed at increasing land productivity.</Para>

          <Heading>Concept of Sustainability as It Affects Agriculture</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">When IUCN proposed the sustainable development approach way back in 1980 as a World Conservation Strategy, it advanced it as a strategic approach to the integration of conservation and development consistent with the objectives of ecosystem maintenance, the preservation of genetic diversity and sustainable utilization of resources. To further the understanding and implementation of the approach, the UN set up the World commission for Environment and Development (WCED) in 1983 to formulate “a global agenda for change” and 5 years later the UN again convened a conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro popularly known as the Earth Summit in 1992. WCED submitted its report <Emphasis Type="Italic">Our Common Future</Emphasis> commonly known as the Brundtland Report in 1987 and UNCED produced Agenda 21.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The WCED report, the key statement of sustainable development, defined sustainable development as “development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. It defined environment as not just the biophysical natural domain but also the socio-political human components that constitute a global environment for which there is an interdependent world-linkages among poverty, inequality and environmental degradation. What was envisaged as needed then was the recognition that there was a mismatch between the natural systems’ capacity and the humanity’s ability to fit its activities into this framework. This called for a need to sustain and expand the environmental resource base to meet humanity’s activities. At the time, the sustainability concept was necessitated by the perception that the world was facing a Meta crisis (crises of development, environment and insecurity) while the main components of sustainability were seen as the environment, growth and equity.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">There has been much debate on the wholeness of the concept “sustainable” and/or “sustainability” particularly with regards to economic growth. There is a great deal of uncertainty over how to apply the concept and how to assess the implications for any given context to which it is applied. Major issues that have generated a great deal of discussion include the word “needs”, intra-generational aspect (i.e. present and future generations) as well as issues of equity. The ensuing interaction between global economy and global ecology entailed environmental degradation fuelled by dramatic population growth and rising poverty levels particularly in the developing world. WECD report advocated sustainable development within the framework of equity; its ideal sustainability was to achieve basic needs for all human kind particularly those living in the fourth world (i.e. averting poverty among those living in absolute poverty in the third world). The report created the impression that equity, growth and environmental maintenance are simultaneously possible with each nation achieving its full economic potential and at the same time enhancing its resource base. However, the main question that has emerged is the variation that spans the globe.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In 1992, the UN commissioned the Earth Summit to review progress made in sustainability and ten years later, the UN convened another world conference in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2002 to review progress accomplished in protecting the global environment and reducing poverty world-wide. From this 2002 conference, several issues emerged among them the need to strengthen decision-making and harnessing science and technology and for managing linkages to the global economy and overcoming obstacles to reforms on the social dimension of sustainable development. Further shortcomings were observed in the areas of unsatisfied social needs including widespread poverty, social exclusion, unemployment and unmet aspirations for better living conditions. These led to less attention being paid to environmental problems and increased unwillingness to shift to more environmentally sound patterns of production and consumption. It was also realized that because of inappropriate incentives to consumers and producers, the higher scale of economic activity had led to pressures on the local and global environment interfering with climate systems and leading to biodiversity loss, water scarcity and over-exploitation of agricultural resources.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Solutions to this state of affairs were envisioned to lie with making markets for agricultural products work for sustainable development through adjusting prices which would incorporate the full cost of environmental degradation, instituting regulations which guard against pollution control and imposing market-based instruments such as taxes and tradable permit systems. Related regulations include instituting taxi on pollutant emitters. Additional solutions were envisaged in the area of harnessing science and technology to avoiding integrative (de-coupling) economic growth and further environmental degradation through innovation adjustment and change to suit different scenarios. Here interventions by governments was seen to be the key to success; interventions such as incentives to agricultural innovators to encourage cleaner technologies including those on agricultural production and product processing. Furthermore, success in this area was said to depend on engaging researchers from different sectors of the economy (multidisciplinary teams), promoting public/private partnerships, integrating resource management as well as strengthening decision making and implementation as well as embracing emerging concepts such as globalization and their effects on agricultural products trade. More issues observed as requiring attention during this conference were related to human impacts leading to climate change, non-renewable resources exhaustion and inadequate waste management techniques.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Sustainability which has been described as a “fuzzy and ambiguous terminology” is sometimes seen as a bridging concept between conservation and development with several dimensions including avoiding land degradation; conserving biological diversity (watersheds, estuaries and global atmosphere); maintaining ecological services and social economic sustainability (i.e. sustaining and improving human livelihoods) Pauli (<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2012</CitationRef>); advocating the wise use of agrochemicals and fossil fuel inputs to avoid human health impacts and overdependence of finite resources and equity as well as fairness among the developed and lesser developed countries, urban and rural populations, racial and ethnic groups and gender.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Although sustainability is sometimes criticized as a vague concept, conservation and development in agriculture can be implemented by developing indicators for different goals through collaborative processes and seeking sum solutions that are geared towards promoting bio-diversity-related conservation that promotes human livelihood systems and integration. Over time, it has been demonstrated that sustainability and conservation issues are interdisciplinary in nature and require multidisciplinary approach involving the intervention of a wide range of scientists. Problem oriented interdisciplinary research that promotes collaboration among scientific disciplines and stakeholders in the handling of agricultural problems. It requires input from science and technology, participatory approaches which are employed to minimize disagreements and dissatisfaction among the stakeholders. Sustainable and Conservation development issues require knowledge generation and development of new technologies to promote new approaches towards handling and management of the environmental resources including social issues. These issues come out clearly as one reads Chap. <ExternalRef>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Major sources of terrestrial mitigation from agriculture should include cropland management including improved agronomic practices which will generate higher inputs of carbon residue, leading to increased soil carbon storage. Such practices include using improved crop varieties, extending crop rotations, avoiding use of bare fallow and using cover crops as well as integrated nutrient management that can reduce emissions on-site by reducing leaching and volatile losses, improving nitrogen use efficiency through precision farming and improving fertilizer application timing. Other interventions should look into increasing available water in the root zone through water management that can enhance biomass production, increase the amount of above-ground and root biomass returned to the soil to improve soil organic carbon concentration. Others include soil and water conservation measures such as the construction of soil or stone bunds, drainage measures and irrigation which constitute important aspects of water management (Parry et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Further mitigations should include tillage management practices with minimal soil disturbance and incorporation of crop residue to decrease soil carbon losses through enhanced decomposition and reduced erosion. Systems that retain crop residues tend to increase soil carbon because these residues are the precursors of soil organic matter. More interventions should include agro-forestry systems because they increase carbon storage and may also reduce soil carbon losses stemming from erosion. Agro-forestry systems include combining crops with trees for timber, firewood, fodder and other products, and establishing shelter belts and riparian zones/buffer strips with woody species. Furthermore, draining organic soils for cultivation should be avoided and soil productivity should be reclaimed through re-vegetation; applying nutrient amendments and organic substrates such as manures, bio-solids and composts; reducing tillage and retaining crop residues; increasing fertilizer use in regions with low nitrogen content (as in much of sub-Saharan Africa) and conserving water.</Para>

          <Heading>Poverty and Hunger</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">According to FAO State of Food Insecurity in the World 2013, a total of 842 million people in 2011–2013, or around one in eight people in the world, were estimated to be suffering from chronic hunger, regularly not getting enough food to conduct an active life. This figure is lower than the 868 million reported during 2010–2012. FAO estimated that nearly 870 million people of the 7.1 billion people in the world, or one in eight, were suffering from chronic undernourishment during 2010–2012. Almost all the hungry people, 852 million, lived in developing countries, representing 15 % of the population of developing counties. Comparatively, there were only 16 million undernourished people in developed countries (FAO <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Statistics in the 2013 FAO report on food insecurity in the world also show that the number of hungry people grew in Africa over the 2010–2012 periods, from 175 million to 239 million, with nearly 20 million added in the last recent years during when nearly one in four people were hungry. Sadly in sub-Saharan Africa, the modest progress that had been recorded during a few years prior to 2007 was reversed, with hunger rising 2 % per year since then. Comparatively developed regions also saw the number of hungry rise, from 13 million in 2004–2006 to 16 million in 2010–2012, reversing a steady decrease in previous years from 20 million in 1990–1992 (FAO <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Poverty is the principle cause of hunger while the causes of poverty are many and varied, including a lack of individual resources and responsibility, unequal income distribution, conflict and bad government policy, exploitation of the less fortunate by people and businesses with power and influence, or some combination of these and others. Hunger and malnutrition, closely related to poverty, have become rural and urban problems in modern social settings. According to the World Bank estimates, as of 2008, there were 1.345 million poor people in developing countries who lived on $1.25 per day or less. These estimates also show that the number of people in extreme poverty in Sub-Sahara Africa has increased in recent years. Harmful economic systems are quoted as the underlying cause of poverty. Control over resources and income is based on military, political and economic power that typically ends up in the hands of a minority, who live well, while those at the bottom barely survive (Kim <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Conflict contributes to poverty and hunger due to the large number of refugees who lose everything when fleeing from conflicts and end living in squalor in refugee camps. Despite some large-scale repatriation movements, there has been a significant increase in refugee numbers. By the end of 2008, the total number of refugees under UNHCR’s mandate exceeded 10 million and the number of conflict-induced internally displaced persons reached some 26 million worldwide at the end of that year. According to UNHCR, the exact number of stateless people is difficult to give, but what is vividly observable is the anguishing and despondency for those affected by conflict which is a cause of hunger. UNHCR estimates show that overall 1.02 billion people suffer from chronic hunger while 36 million people are displaced (UNHCR <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Hunger is also a cause of poverty, because hunger causes poor health, low levels of energy and even mental impairment which lead to even greater poverty by reducing people’s ability to work and learn to improve their skills thus leading to even greater hunger. In recent years, climate change is increasingly viewed as a current and future cause of hunger and poverty. Increasing drought, flooding, and changing climatic patterns requiring a shift in crops and farming practices that may not be easily accomplished are three key issues.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Three-quarters of the world’s poor live in rural areas and make their living from agriculture. It has been documented severally that hunger and child malnutrition are greater in these areas than in urban areas. Child undernourishment incapacitates children’s development for a lifetime as it hinders the development of intelligence; reduces attention and learning capacities and it reduces the vitality of individuals, as well as making them more prone to disease. Moreover, the higher the proportion of the rural population that obtains its income solely from subsistence farming the higher the incidence of hunger and malnutrition i.e. where there are no benefit of pro-poor technologies and access to markets (rural areas).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Eradicating extreme hunger and poverty depends on agriculture the most because it has been shown that there are strong, direct relationships between agricultural productivity, hunger, and poverty. Therefore policies that support improvements in agricultural productivity aimed at small-scale agricultural producers will benefit the rural poor first. Increased agricultural productivity enables the small-scale agricultural producers to grow more food, which translates into better diets and, under market conditions that offer a level playing field, into higher farm incomes. With more money, small-scale producers are more likely to diversify production and grow higher-value crops, benefiting not only themselves but the economy as a whole. According to FAO, addressing agriculture and population growth is vital to achieving food security. Other organizations too have come to this conclusion and advocate improvements in agriculture, and population control.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Way back in 1991, after considerable international debate, the World Bank acknowledged that investing in people provides the firmest foundation for lasting development (World Bank <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">1991</CitationRef>). For the World Bank and for other international organizations such as USAID, this meant in principle better education, higher standards of health and nutrition, less poverty, a cleaner environment, more equality of opportunity, greater individual freedom, and a richer cultural life. However, reaching these ends requires economic growth, which, under current global economic conditions, depends heavily on productivity, technological progress, and human capital.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">To increase productivity, countries must therefore compete effectively in the global market and make optimum use of new technologies. CIDA of Canada, in its report “<Emphasis Type="Italic">Sharing Our Future</Emphasis>” identified four principles of social development: poverty alleviation must be put first; people must be helped to help themselves; development priorities must prevail; and partnership must be the key (CIDA <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">1987</CitationRef>). This interpretation was shared by the World Bank: it recognized that adjustment must be complemented by poverty alleviation. In terms of programs, CIDA’s approach emphasized poverty alleviation and self-help through its focus on basic human needs. Similarly, OECD of Britain, put people up front, proposing a social-development concept in terms of capacity development at all levels: national, regional, local, and individual while the MDGs advocate among other interventions, providing soil nutrients to farmers in sub-Saharan Africa to reduce poverty.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Elsewhere, writers have expressed similar sentiments over the years when they stated that without doubt, the alleviation of extreme poverty is a priority (Chambers <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">1995</CitationRef>). However, it must be recognized that in isolation, poverty alleviation is a short-term concern. The critical issue is how to address poverty in the broader framework of public policies and how, in so doing, to lay the base for sustainable development over the long term. A good example is education; not just basic education but education for the small-scale agricultural producers, who are central to poverty alleviation in most developing countries, Southern Africa included. The goal should be to strengthen rural livelihoods through education and appropriate technologies; those geared towards making these livelihoods sustainable and resilient to climatic stress and shocks.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">As a continent, Africa recognizes that enhanced agricultural performance is the key to growth and poverty reduction through its direct impact on job creation and increasing opportunities, especially for women and for the youth; on food security; improved nutrition and building resilience. This is because most African economies and livelihoods largely depend on agriculture and the associated manufacturing and processing industries. In 2003, the AU adopted the Maputo Declaration on Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) setting broad targets of 6 % annual growth in agricultural GDP, and allocation of at least 10 % of public expenditures to the agricultural sector. AU put forward its intentions to achieve these targets through collective actions across the continent focused on improving agricultural planning and policies, scaling up investment to implement these plans and policies, and harmonizing external support around African-owned plans (PAEPARD<CitationRef CitationID="CR002">2014</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Throughout the decade following the 2003 declaration, Africa as a continent has been guided by a well-formulated framework that has influenced policies, strategies and actions for agricultural development and transformation. Assessments carried out just before the beginning of 2014 have revealed that this framework and its objectives have been instrumental in raising the profile of agriculture at the centre of development agenda at national, regional and global levels which has facilitated mobilization and alignment of multi-stakeholders’ partnerships and investments around national agriculture and food security investment plans. The CAADP process has encouraged and facilitated evidence based planning, and commitment to institutional and policy reforms with a sense of mutual accountability for actions and results. Mechanisms such as agricultural sector reviews at country level, and annual CAADP partnership platforms were put into action and used as review and dialogue avenues in fostering accountability for results on agriculture performance.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Recently, the African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government declared the year 2014 to be the Year of Agriculture and Food Security in Africa, marking 10th Anniversary of the adoption of CAADP. Over the last decade, due to CAADP objectives, African agriculture and food security concerns remain high on the policy agenda at national, regional, continental and global levels. Thanks to such concerted actions, the performance of African agriculture has been encouraging; an annual average agricultural GDP growth of nearly 4 % since 2003 has been realized. This is well above the agricultural GDP growth rates for the previous several decades (PAEPARD <CitationRef CitationID="CR002">2014</CitationRef>). AU’s recent declaration is considered an important milestone and an opportunity that should be seized in the resolve to continue to uphold agriculture and food security as priority for policy and practical actions to generate concrete results and impacts.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The year for African Agriculture and Food Security is being commemorated across Africa, in Member States, Regional Economic Communities, Continental organizations, and the AU Headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The process is envisioned to give opportunities to communities, state and non-state actors in Africa to interact and express their voices on what works for them and chart the focus and targets for the next decade. The process is expected to contribute towards setting the agenda for sustaining the CAADP momentum which forms the basis for African leaders to recommit themselves towards realizing the vision set out in 2003. The agenda of agricultural transformation across Africa is strategically positioned to provide enormous opportunities for an inclusive and sustainable development.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It is gratifying to note that investments driven by strong political commitment and leadership and fostering effective partnerships has yielded very positive results so that by the beginning of 2014, 34 AU Member States had signed CAADP compacts; 30 among them having developed formal national agriculture and food security investment plans which were used as their medium term expenditure frameworks for agriculture, thus resulting in improved agricultural planning. At regional level, 50 % of the continent has entered into regional compacts with fully developed investment plans. On average public agricultural expenditures have risen by over 7 % per year across Africa since 2003, nearly doubling public agricultural expenditures since the launch of CAADP. The important fact to note here is that the decade saw sustainable growth in agricultural sector which has generally supported sustainable rural livelihoods throughout the continent.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Sustainable rural livelihoods have been defined as the capabilities, assets (both material and social resources) and activities required for a means of living; livelihoods capable of coping with and recovering from stresses and shocks, able to maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets now and in the future while not undermining the natural resource base. Rural livelihoods are sustainable if they can maintain long-term productivity of natural resources and do not undermine the livelihoods of others or livelihood options open to others. The use of locally available resource materials ensures sustainability. Rural livelihoods are economically sustainable when a given level of expenditure can be maintained over time i.e. if a baseline level of economic welfare can be achieved and sustained. Rural livelihoods are socially sustainable when social equity can be maximized; if they can cope with and recover from stress and shocks and provide for future generations; they are institutionally sustainable when the prevailing structures and processes have the capacity to continue to perform their functions over a long period of time and they do not show dependence upon external support unless the support itself is economically and institutionally sustainable. And lastly rural livelihoods are environmentally sustainable when they maintain or enhance the local and global assets in which livelihoods depend, and have net beneficial effects on other livelihoods (Msangi <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2008b</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Sustainability among rural livelihood systems must be supported by multidisciplinary research and analyses in order to appreciate and understand these systems (traditional and modern) particularly where the livelihood systems are hugely dependent on agriculture and the exploitation and management of natural resources. In most countries in Southern Africa where the majority of the population lives in rural areas, their livelihoods largely revolve around land ownership and natural resources exploitation and trade of basic agricultural goods. Land acts as security, as a means to gain access to other livelihood options; it acts as leverage for other forms of investment and linkages. It has been argued that the agricultural sector in most parts of rural Southern Africa lacks science, technology and financial investments and that productivity is low compared to other sectors. Rural development interventions must therefore focus on promoting sustainable livelihoods including improving productivity (both land and human) to enhance economic performance and opportunities.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In Southern Africa, rural livelihood systems are very vulnerable to land degradation, diseases and increased magnitudes of environmental hazards such as those attributed to climate change (e.g. unpredictable droughts and floods). Agriculture, a major sector of the economy in Southern Africa, is vulnerable to year-to-year weather fluctuations and variable climatic conditions. Rural development interventions must therefore focus attention on communication infrastructure, land management, land ownership, land tenure, research and extension as well as disease prevention and strengthening mitigation options as well as indigenous people’s earlier coping strategies. Adjustment to climate change adversities heavily rely on improved management and adaptive techniques which incorporate traditional knowledge that has evolved over time due to climate variability characterizing the region. It has emerged that recent increased magnitude of these vagaries is a challenge to many rural communities (Msangi <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">2008a</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In developing countries and in rural areas of Southern Africa in particular, these climate change challenges are exacerbated by multiple-stresses and limitations including low adaptive capacity, limited access to knowledge and technology support, extreme poverty, weak policy support, and lack of widespread integrated approaches for strategic planning and regional cooperation. The tragedy of climate change adverse impacts is the fact that whereas the industrially developed countries bear the largest responsibility for the causes of climate change, the less-industrial developing countries particularly those in Africa are the most vulnerable to the worst consequences of climate change. A summary of the 2007 IPCC report on the vulnerability of the African continent shows that by 2020, between 75 and 250 million people are projected to be exposed to increased water stress due to climate change and the yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50 % in some countries. This would further adversely affect food security and exacerbate malnutrition. This prediction was further confirmed during the February 2009 meeting on climate change in Copenhagen, Denmark (Copenhagen Climate Change Conference 2009). For Southern Africa, it was depicted that the sea level would rise by between 90 and 130 cm by the end of this century thus worsening the plight of the region (Amweelo <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">On the other hand it must be recognized that traditional rural livelihood systems shaped by the natural environment are integral resources to communities and so form a basis for many of the society’s beliefs, cultures and practices. Practices such as traditional farming techniques, changing hunting and gathering habits, crop and livelihood diversification, seasonal and climate forecasting as well as community-based disaster risk reduction. Therefore, respecting indigenous knowledge systems, community structures, institutional management agencies and site-specific resource management will contribute immensely towards strengthening the degree of success in devising sustainable adaptive alternatives. By enhancing the old-age traditional coping strategies through incorporation of indigenous knowledge into research and policy formulations, researchers and governments will go a long way in assisting the rural populations to adapt and adjust their livelihood systems to the changing climatic conditions (Msangi <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">2004</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Policies and investments (both by public and private sectors) geared towards supporting rural populations in adaptation and mitigation processes would enhance the rural population’s resilience to climate change. Such undertakings would also help conserve biodiversity and improve ecosystem integrity as well as promote sustainability in natural resource management in the region. Research, education and specific management strategies (e.g. land use diversification, management and soil erosion control; flood and drought mitigation; food preservation, storage and marketing) should form part of the needed support. It would be prudent also to invest in education, awareness and capacity building to effectively empower rural populations using their own existing institutions which they can identify with; institutions such as chief’s council, village committees and village councils; cooperatives and specific resource committees.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The issue of sound policies and management techniques that govern the sustainability of food security and poverty alleviation is addressed in Chap. <ExternalRef>

            </ExternalRef> of this book. The chapter looks back at issues raised way back in 1992 when the UN commissioned the Earth Summit to review progress made in sustainability and those raised during the World Conference held in 2002 to review progress accomplished in protecting the global environment and reducing poverty world-wide. From the 2002 conference, several issues emerged among them the need to strengthen policies that guide decision makers and strengthen linkages to the global economy. Solutions were envisioned to lie with making markets work for sustainable development through adjusting prices which would incorporate the full cost of environmental degradation, instituting regulations which guard against pollution control and imposing market-based instruments such as taxes and tradable permit systems. The main goal of these policies was to guide management issues that would bring about agrarian reforms and enhance commercialization and marketing policies that would strengthen the position of the rural small-scale agricultural producers and adequately address poverty and food security issues (Msangi <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In Southern Africa, it is access to markets and product perishability that constrain small-scale agriculture sector and the food security in the region. Throughout the region, agricultural produce from small-scale agricultural producers is often lost after production due to spoilage and inability to access the markets in good time. Poorly developed infrastructure and non-availability of reliable supportive organizations that represent and serve the small-scale agricultural producers compound an already bad situation. These factors reduce small-scale producers’ opportunities and incentives to participate in formal markets, a situation which makes it difficult for them to shift into commercial farming and earning appreciable earnings from their efforts.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Equally important as access to markets and adequate policies that serve the small-scale agriculture sector is the paucity of relevant research on traditional crops. While cash crops such as grapes, sisal, cotton, grapes, green beans, sugar-cane, coffee, tea and cut flowers were accorded a great deal of attention in form of research, extension services and provision of agricultural inputs during the colonial era in Southern Africa, traditional subsistence crops such as millet, sorghum, pearl millet (<Emphasis Type="Italic">mahangu</Emphasis>) and cassava were neglected. Agricultural research, agricultural inputs availability as well as extension services are essential in increasing land productivity and securing food self sufficiency among small-scale producers. Substantial increase in agricultural production demands new innovations in agricultural practices, in farming methods and in the use of qualitative genetic materials of both plants and animals. The goal of pillar 4 of the New Economic Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)’s Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) is to enhance and improve the effectiveness of agricultural research and development which aim to improve agricultural production. This is in line with one of the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of achieving 50 % reduction in poverty by 2015 and attaining 6 % growth in agriculture production per annum.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The persistent food and nutrition insecurity and low income among the rural farmers in developing countries and those in Southern Africa are among the factors which largely contribute towards prevalent poverty and poor health. It has been demonstrated and acknowledged that the situation is even worse among the rural resource-poor households and particularly women who continue to use rudimentary arduous methods and equipment to produce and process food for their families. This is despite the fact that locally grown crops like cassava, pearl millet, sorghum and high protein crops such as cowpeas and soybeans with high potential in improving household food security have not been widely incorporated into traditional food processing methods. Cassava, Africa’s second most important food staple, after maize, in terms of calories consumed requires fortification to improve its nutritional value. Cassava which is widely produced for food and income generation ranks high among food crops in many sub-Saharan African countries owing to, among other factors, its agronomical advantages as compared to other crops. Cassava has the ability to grow in poor soils and low rainfall while giving reasonable yields compared to other crops.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Understandably, many small-scale agricultural producers in Southern Africa remain skeptical on the value of agricultural research because it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that research can greatly improve agricultural land productivity which would improve poverty and food security to a great extent. Research input takes time to be seen especially where the consumer of the research findings and recommendations do not adopt these recommendations as detailed by the researchers. Often the small-scale agricultural producers being the main customers of research findings prefer to stick to their traditional methods of production because these are what they know and the one that have supported previous generations. Therefore it is prudent to revisit the research agenda, increase funding and investments in agricultural research activities that will lead to improved technology development and strengthening of extension services so as to convince and support the small-scale agricultural producers. These and other issues on the need and benefits of agricultural research are discussed in Chap. <ExternalRef>

            </ExternalRef> also discusses research findings which demonstrate how pearl millet and cassava can be enriched through improved processing and fortification methods to assist in mitigating food and nutritional insecurity including severe protein malnutrition rampant in those areas dependent on the two crops. This is mainly due to the fact that proteins from animal sources are relatively in short supply and too expensive for the majority of the people in rural communities. Most diets thus derive their proteins from traditional vegetable sources, such as beans and leafy vegetables, which are inherently low in protein content thus leading to diets low in protein. High protein legumes such as cowpeas and soybeans are not widely incorporated into rural areas diets. This low protein intake coupled with a low caloric intake contributes to rampant malnutrition, especially in the form of Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM).</Para>

            </ExternalRef> of this book looks at the role that urban and peri-urban agriculture plays in enhancing food security in Southern Africa cities and towns. Globally, it is reported that since 2010 half of the world’s population lives in cities and that the world’s urban population will almost double from the current 3.5 billion (about 50 %) to more than six billion by 2050. An estimated 40 % of Africa’s population lived in urban areas by 2009 (UN-HABITAT <CitationRef CitationID="CR003">2009</CitationRef>; UNDP <CitationRef CitationID="CR004">2012</CitationRef>). In Southern Africa, urbanization is growing at an alarming rate due to increasing rural–urban migration triggered by dwindling employment opportunities in rural areas and due to the ever present attractions perceived to exist in the urban areas; attractions which lure the young and able bodied rural population to migrate to towns. Although cities will continue to largely depend on rural agriculture, urban and peri-urban agriculture is making an appreciable contribution to cities across the globe.</Para>

            </ExternalRef> of this book examines the role indigenous plant resources play in enhancing food security among small-scale agricultural producers in the dry lands of Southern Africa and Namibia in particular. The chapter demonstrates that the inhabitants of the dry lands had a rich heritage of ably managing and living harmoniously with their environment utilizing resources wisely stretching these from years of abundance into lean years. Many years of experience and folklore handed down over generations had equipped these people with viable adaptations to the unpredictable weather and harsh environment. Long traditional survival techniques included livestock rearing, keeping a few cattle and mostly small stock such as goats and sheep. They harvested wild fruits and vegetables to augment those they cultivated and harvested wildlife to supplement the meat they got from the animals they reared in their settlements.</Para>

            </ExternalRef> of this book discusses the role of small stock in enhancing food security and mitigating poverty among the small scale agricultural producers in Namibia. Namibia being a dry country, livestock farming constitutes an important agricultural activity that supports diets of the majority of the people. Small stock plays an important role in the livelihoods and food security for the small-scale agricultural producers in both southern and northern Namibia. Sheep and goats constitute the bulk of the small stock population kept to support food security and alleviate poverty. About 60 % of all Namibian goats belong to indigenous breeds which have valuable genetic properties that contribute to high fertility and resistance to aridity and disease (Werner and Odendaal <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>

            </ExternalRef> discusses the advantages of climate smart agriculture particularly those based on research that employ a participatory approach that enables small-scale agricultural producers to understand and apply weather and climatic data into farming activities. The chapter demonstrates that since agricultural activities are vulnerable to variable weather and climatic conditions, agricultural decision-making should encompass weather and climatic information into decisions on land use and land management, selection of plant breeds and crop production practices like land preparation, weeding, pest and disease control as well as harvesting and crop storage. Citing a case study carried out in Limpopo, South Africa, the chapter demonstrates that consideration of weather risks such as short-term rainfall characteristics and short-term in-seasonal drought can be used effectively in determining the timing of land preparation, sowing, fertilizer application and pest and disease control. The case study demonstrates the practicability of participatory approach where the small scale agricultural producers work closely with the scientists and extension officials to produce good results.</Para>
