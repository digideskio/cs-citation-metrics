Yet physicians from an underrepresented minority in medicine (URMM) remain relatively scarce in the medical workforce. In fact, African Americans and Hispanics in particular have been relatively absent from the surgical workforce and especially from academic surgery. One of the key challenges is that there is a dearth of qualified URMM candidates in the pipeline, and the gap between the proportion of the U.S. population that is African American or Hispanic and the percentage of these students graduating from U.S. medical schools continues to widen. As a result, the few URMM surgical leaders face an inordinate burden. This chapter explores the obstacles that URMM surgeons face in ascending to positions of leadership in academic surgery, the approach to overcoming some of these barriers as illustrated by pioneer URMM surgical leaders, and the roles of the URMM surgical leader.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par3" TextBreak="No">The responsibilities of URMM surgical leaders are endless. They must establish their legitimacy as academic superstars, earn the respect and esteem of the broader surgical community, serve as role models, advocates, mentors and sponsors for URMM surgical trainees and faculty, and also as social activists for their constituencies in order to ultimately reduce or eliminate health disparities.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par4" TextBreak="No">Health disparities between URMM and whites remain a vexing problem facing contemporary American society. URMM have shorter life expectancy and suffer a disproportionately higher rate of cardiovascular disease, cancer, birth defects, asthma, diabetes, stroke, sexually transmitted diseases and mental illness than whites [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. The etiology of such disparities is multifactorial in nature and includes, but is not limited to, inequalities in income and education, biological differences among ethnic groups, cultural issues, access to and quality of health care, as well as racial and ethnic discrimination. In fact, the Institute of Medicine argues that racial or ethnic prejudice on the part of health care providers underlies disparities in health care for URMM even when they have adequate or equal access [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Thus, a culturally diverse work force is important for addressing health disparities. Given the fact that physicians from URMM are more likely to practice in underserved areas following completion of their training, regardless of their chosen subspecialty, this argument provides greater impetus to train more URMM physicians in an effort to mitigate the effects of racial and ethnic discrimination [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. Yet URMM physicians remain markedly underrepresented in the medical workforce, and when it comes to African Americans and Hispanics in particular, they have been relatively absent from academic surgery.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par5" TextBreak="No">To understand the dearth of African Americans and Hispanics in academic surgery, one needs to consider the pipeline issues. Although African Americans and Hispanics comprised 30.3% of the United States population in 2013, Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">16.1</InternalRef> shows that they accounted for only 16% of U.S. medical students in 2013 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. Similarly, among U.S. surgical faculty, African Americans and Hispanics accounted for only 7% of the total and roughly 6% of the tenured surgical faculty [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. This is consistent with the fact that in 2008, these two ethnic groups accounted for less than 14% of surgical residents in training in the U.S. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. Thus, given the small pool of surgical residents, it is understandable that there is a disproportionately lower number of URMM physicians on the surgical faculty at most institutions, or in leadership positions in academic surgery, more generally. Furthermore, although the number of medical students graduating from U.S. medical schools over the past 10 years has increased, the gap between the number of URMM medical school graduates and their relative proportion in the U.S. population remains substantial. For instance, in 2002, African Americans and Hispanics accounted for 13.2% of U.S. medical school graduates and 25.3% of the U.S. population [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. By 2011, there was a net increase of 1,889 medical school graduates during that 10-year period. Whites accounted for 39%, Asians 38%, while African Americans and Hispanics accounted for 13% and 9% of the net increase respectively. Overall, African Americans and Hispanics accounted for 14.2% of U.S. medical school graduates in 2011 while representing 29.5% of the U.S. population [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. Thus, despite the overall increase in the number of medical school graduates, the gap between the proportion of the U.S. population that is African American or Hispanic and the percentage of these students graduating from U.S. medical schools continues to increase. This observation is particularly concerning since Hispanics and African Americans will account for nearly 35% of the U.S. population by the year 2030. Furthermore, by the year 2020, African Americans and Hispanics will account for over 37% of the college age population (18year olds), which represents the future pool of U.S. physicians [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]. Failure to reverse this alarming trend could result in further increases in health disparities with fewer URMM entering academic surgery and even fewer becoming leaders in academic surgery. <Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab1">

For those URMM students who aspire to pursue a surgical career after graduating from medical school, they face a plethora of other barriers during surgical residency and as junior faculty that often impede their professional advancement along the academic ladder (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">16.1</InternalRef>). These include a lack of role models, a lack of mentorship, inadequate counseling, financial support and research infrastructure [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

            <Heading>How Can One Overcome These Barriers?</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par7" TextBreak="No">Trailblazers such as Charles Drew and Samuel Kountz, and more recently, LaSalle Leffall, Claude Organ, and L.D. Britt, to name a few, have been able to overcome all sorts of barriers to reach the apogee of American Surgery. These giants of American surgery, who happen to be from an URMM, share one common thread: they personified excellence. According to an anonymous writer, excellence is the “the result of caring more than others think is wise, risking more than others think is safe, dreaming more than others think is practical, and expecting more than others think is possible.” Indeed, these pioneers exemplified the notion that excellence will silence all critics. Undoubtedly, they would be inducted into the “Hall of Fame of American Surgery” if such an entity existed.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par8" TextBreak="No">Charles R. Drew epitomized excellence. His brilliant work while a research fellow and surgery resident at Columbia University Presbyterian Hospital helped to elucidate the causative factors in the pathogenesis of shock. In conjunction with John Scudder, he studied the efficacy of blood plasma in the treatment of secondary shock. It is widely held that his doctoral thesis on “Banked Blood” not only provided the basis for separating the components of whole blood, such as plasma from the red cells, but also may have led to the establishment of the modern blood bank [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. As such, he was appointed director of the first American Red Cross Blood Bank at Presbyterian Hospital.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par9" TextBreak="No">Similarly, Samuel L. Kountz distinguished himself as a superb academic surgeon. His seminal work on the “Mechanism of Rejection of Homotransplanted Kidneys” was published in <Emphasis Type="Italic">Nature</Emphasis> in 1963 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. In addition to serving as Chair of the Department of Surgery at the State University of New York at Downstate, he held numerous leadership positions in prestigious academic surgical societies, ultimately culminating with his ascendancy to the presidency of the Society of University Surgeons in 1975. Just like Charles Drew, an untimely death abbreviated his meteoric rise in academic surgery, which, almost certainly, would have taken him to the pinnacle of American surgery, the presidency of the American College of Surgeons.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par10" TextBreak="No">This distinction, President of the American College of Surgeons, belongs to LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr., the first African American or URMM to hold this esteemed and revered position. Dr. Leffall’s brilliance was evident as early as his high school years, when he was named valedictorian of his class at 15 years old [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. He repeated this feat 7 years later at Howard University College of Medicine, graduating at the top of his class. This was followed by a fellowship in surgical oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital during which he distinguished himself as one of the stellar fellows. Upon his return as an Assistant Professor of Surgery at Howard University, he quickly rose through the ranks to become Chair of the Department. In addition, as a distinguished surgical oncologist, he rose to become President of the American Cancer Society and the Society of Surgical Oncology, the first African American to hold these positions, prior to his election as President of the American College of Surgeons in 1995. Finally, in 2002, he was named chairman of the President’s Cancer Panel.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par11" TextBreak="No">Claude H. Organ, Jr. holds the distinction of being the first African American to assume the chairmanship of a department of surgery at a predominantly white medical school, his alma mater, Creighton University [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. His tremendous work ethic, exceptional commitment to excellence, and unparalleled dedication to mentoring not only earned him the respect of his colleagues and students but also contributed to his success as an academic surgeon. Dr. Organ was the first African American editor of the surgical journal with the largest distribution in the country, Archives of Surgery. In addition, he was a founding member of the Society of Black Academic Surgeons, an organization devoted to promoting mentoring and scholarship among surgical trainees and faculty from an URMM background. In 2003, Dr. Organ became the second African American President of the American College of Surgeons.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par12" TextBreak="No">L.D. Britt graduated from Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health on his way to becoming the first African American professor of surgery in the Commonwealth of Virginia and chair of the department of surgery at Eastern Virginia Medical School [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. During his tenure, he has received numerous accolades nationally and internationally, including the Robert J. Glaser Distinguished Educator Award, the highest teaching award or accolade in medicine given by the Association of American Medical Colleges [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>]. He has served as president of numerous prestigious academic surgical societies including the Southern Surgical Society, the American Surgical Association, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, the Society of Black Academic Surgeons, and the American College of Surgeons.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par13" TextBreak="No">There are many other worthy URMM surgical leaders who have had to overcome significant barriers to ultimately play an influential role in American surgery. Time and space do not permit an encyclopedic chronicle of their respective journeys. Suffice it to say, they all shared the same relentless passion for the pursuit of excellence. However, while one can argue that excellence is the essential scaffold for success, it is the quest for significance, or the desire to make the biggest difference possible in the lives of others and in their community, that propelled these trailblazers, legendary pioneers and role models to the heights of American surgery.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par17" TextBreak="No">One of the challenging problems that impede the development of surgical leaders from an URMM is the vicious circle created by a limited pipeline, lack of diversity in the surgical workforce, paucity of role models, lack of mentorship, inadequate research infrastructure, counseling, and financial support, as well as other institutional barriers that often result in a feeling of isolation for both URMM surgical trainees and faculty (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">16.1</InternalRef>). In fact, a recent survey of faculty from 26 U.S. medical schools reported that compared to non-URMM faculty, URMM faculty feel like outsiders because of a lack of inclusion, trust, and relationship with their non-minority counterparts [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. A similar survey of surgical residents confirmed these sentiments, indicating that these feelings begin to evolve during training [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. In addition, according to Pololi and colleagues, a significant proportion of URMM faculty reported being subjected to racial or ethnic discrimination by a superior, and they also noted a lack of institutional effort to promote equity and diversity. Yet, despite these observations, URMM faculty were more likely to aspire to ascend to leadership positions than their non-URMM counterparts. However, as noted by the authors, the juxtaposition of high leadership aspirations with the perception of isolation, lack of trust and inclusion predisposes URMM faculty to become disillusioned and to abandon academic medicine completely, thus further eroding the potential pool of future leaders.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par18" TextBreak="No">Based on the foregoing discussion, a surgical leader from an URMM faces a daunting task. A leader in academic surgery, who happens to be an URMM, has to first establish himself or herself as an academic surgeon. This designation is defined by metrics that are race- and color-blind. In general, those metrics include local advancement or promotion along the academic ladder, assumption of institutional leadership positions, and national recognition or acknowledgment of the URMM leader’s accomplishments by his or her selection for leadership positions by external bodies such as academic surgical societies, boards, national committees, NIH study sections, etc. Very rarely, if ever, does anyone attain leadership positions in academia based on race or tokenism; rather, such an accomplishment is almost always rooted in demonstrating a tradition of excellence and the ability to inspire others. As noted by Charles Drew, “excellence of performance will transcend artificial barriers created by man” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>]. In addition to establishing his or her credentials as a <Emphasis Type="Italic">bona fide</Emphasis> academic surgeon and earning the respect of his or her peers, the leader in academic surgery who is from an URMM has to fill in many gaps by his or her willingness to mentor, nurture, train, coach, support, advocate for, and ultimately sponsor URMM surgical trainees and junior faculty by providing them access to growth opportunities (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">16.2</InternalRef>). Indeed, the URMM surgical leader has the unique responsibility or duty to serve as a role model for members of his or her underrepresented minority constituency, to help them grow, develop, and to guide them to success. In this context, the URMM mentor or leader must be able to attract, inspire, empower, and ultimately liberate the URMM surgical trainee or mentee to complete the maturation process, while at the same time continuing to advocate for his or her needs, albeit from a distance [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]. Thus, the URMM surgical leader must have a tireless commitment to both mentorship and sponsorship (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">16.3</InternalRef>). In essence, URMM surgical leaders have to pay “the color tax” through their availability to mentor and sponsor other URMM surgical trainees and faculty [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]. They must feel the innate desire to amplify their impact beyond their individual academic contributions by seizing the opportunity to apply the credo that has become ingrained in the fabric or DNA of most URMM surgical leaders and that has become an essential mission of, or rallying call for, the Society of Black Academic Surgeons: “EACH ONE REACH ONE” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>]. However, the URMM surgical leader also has a special responsibility to ensure that expanding opportunity for URMM surgical trainees or faculty should never be confused or equated with lowering the standards. There needs to be continued emphasis on the relentless pursuit of excellence and sustained scholarly productivity. URMM mentees have to be prepared to perform “better” than the norm, while URMM surgical leaders accept the burden of having to enlighten the broader surgical community that there are precious few jobs, if any, that they cannot perform. Thus, URMM surgical leaders must also serve as visible role models for the majority population at every level, including students, residents, faculty, deans, presidents and CEOs, to demonstrate that URMM surgeons can make significant contributions to the field of surgery. In short, they must have broad appeal to influence the larger sector of society or the surgical community to follow them in expanding opportunities for competent or meritorious URMM surgical trainees and faculty, because, to paraphrase Peter Drucker, there is no leadership without “followership” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>]. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig2">

                    <SimplePara>Crucial functions in leadership development. The surgical trainee or future leader is responsible for developing his or her skill set. He or she must have an unwavering commitment to excellence and the desire to succeed. Mentors collaborate with surgical trainees or junior faculty (leaders in development) by coaching, training, supporting, and providing candid advice on choices and performance. Mentors also help develop and monitor the mentee’s personal strategic plan. Sponsors recognize talented surgical trainees (emerging future leaders) and provide them access to growth opportunities. Sponsors may also support long strategic maneuvers</SimplePara>

            <Para ID="Par19" TextBreak="No">To illustrate the foregoing concept, Charles Drew’s outstanding research at Columbia University catapulted him to a position of national and international prominence, which put him in position to advocate for a surgical oncology fellowship position for Jack White, the first African American fellow at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital. In turn, Jack White’s advocacy later helped LaSalle Leffall obtain a surgical oncology fellowship at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>]. Dr. Leffall has helped and inspired hundreds, if not thousands, of African American and other URMM surgeons through his roles as President of the American Cancer Society, the Society of Surgical Oncology and the American College of Surgeons as well as his 25-year chairmanship of the Department of Surgery at Howard University [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>]. As noted earlier, numerous other African American surgeons have held leadership positions in mainstream academic societies that invariably helped pave the way for the new generation of contemporary and future URMM surgical leaders. Sam Kountz’s brilliance and tenacity paved the way for his election to the presidency of the Society of University Surgeons. Claude Organ served as Chair of the American Board of Surgery, Chair of the Residency Review Committee, President of the American College of Surgeons, President of the Society of Black Academic Surgeons, and Editor of Archives of Surgery. L.D. Britt is past president of the American College of Surgeons, the American Surgical Association, the Southern Surgical Society, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, and the Society of Black Academic Surgeons. Haile Debas, another prominent URMM academic surgical leader, served as Dean of the University of California at San Francisco, President of the American Surgical Association, and President of the Society of Black Academic Surgeons. Steven Stain is former Chair of the American Board of Surgery and past president of the Society of Black Academic Surgeons. Henri Ford served as President of the Association for Academic Surgery, the Surgical Infection Society, and the Society of Black Academic Surgeons. Last but not least, Fiemu Nwarieku is past president of the Association for Academic Surgery. The significant increase in the number of African American chairs of departments of surgery and deans of U.S. medical schools in recent years is arguably directly related to the contributions made by previous URMM surgical leaders who were the trailblazers in academic surgery.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par20" TextBreak="No">It should be noted that the responsibilities of surgical leaders in academic surgery who happen to be from an URMM must extend beyond the walls of their institution, hospital facility or surgical societies. Active, meaningful community engagement must be an essential component of the URMM surgical leader’s portfolio. They must exercise their influence to address, at a policy level, the problems or challenges that limit the pipeline of URMM students achieving the necessary proficiency in reading, math and science to enable them to ultimately be competitive for medical school. They must combat racial and ethnic prejudice as well as other barriers that hinder upward social mobility, promote and champion diversity, and lobby for improved access to quality health care for underserved communities while serving as visible role models and as a source of inspiration for their underrepresented minority constituencies. Such grassroots advocacy is a <Emphasis Type="Italic">sine qua non</Emphasis> in order to ultimately reduce or eliminate health disparities. Hence, the responsibilities of URMM surgical leaders are endless.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par21" TextBreak="No">In summary, contemporary surgical leaders who happen to be from an URMM must recognize that whatever stature they have achieved in American surgery is the result of the legacy of excellence and advocacy of past and recent trailblazers such as Charles Drew, Samuel Kountz, LaSalle Leffall, and Claude Organ, to name a few. These individuals were invariably aided along their journey by non-URMM mentors and sponsors who recognized their brilliance and gave them an opportunity to shine. Current URMM surgical leaders must willingly accept to pay the “color tax” of role modeling, mentoring, sponsoring or enhancing opportunities for other URMM surgical trainees and faculty in addition to the base price that they have to pay to be successful academic surgeons. Our predecessors faced a far greater paucity of role models, mentors and sponsors, and had to pay a much greater and more stressful tax in order for us to enjoy the privilege of reaching the highest echelon of American surgery.</Para>
