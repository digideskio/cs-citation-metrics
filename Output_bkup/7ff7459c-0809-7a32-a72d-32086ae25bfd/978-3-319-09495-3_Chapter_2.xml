          <Para TextBreak="No">Trade policies and trade agreements support smooth trading among participating partners. The globalization of markets and the expansion of free-trade agreements have encouraged many areas of the world to consider regional integration as a means to better compete in the world economy. Thus regional integration has allowed several different countries to come together and form common markets. International institutions such as World Customs Organization (WCO), World Trade Organization (WTO) provide guidance on the formulation of policies and legislations governing marketing and trade among countries WTO requires regional trade agreements to reduce tariffs between countries, but does not allow these countries to increase tariffs on countries which are not part of the agreement. Many countries in Africa including those in SADC have embraced market-based food systems and market reforms to enhance farm profitability. Organs such as the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and Southern African Customs Union (SACU) have been formed and are active in trade liberalization in Southern Africa region. Namibia, an emerging free market area has put in place several policies and enacted a variety of legislations to protect, guide and enhance trade in its agricultural sector. Namibia heavily depends on trade through which she imports food products to meet the shortfall in her locally produced foods. Meanwhile, Namibia is vigorously working towards self-sufficiency in food production through her Green Schemes and other undertakings discussed in chapters two, three, five and seven of this book. Despite the concerted efforts being made, there are many constraints that face the country which dictate that Namibia continue to depend on food imports.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Policies are statements of intent formulated to guide the activities of any given organization or entity in order to achieve specific objectives which reflect the intent of the organization/entity that formulated them. Policies contain directives of what is to be done and what not to be done. Good policies are contextually formulated to address varying conditions and specific situations. Such policies should reflect the needs, interests and aspirations of the intended beneficiaries for effective implementation. It has been recognized that for policies to be relevant and well understood by all concerned, the policy making process has to be participatory and inclusive.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Some authors have argued that policy be considered as a long series of more or less related activities and their consequences for those concerned rather than as a discrete decision. That is a proposed course of action of a person, group or government within a given environment providing obstacles and opportunities which the policy was proposed to utilize and overcome in an effort to reach a goal and/or realize an objective or a purpose. This concept of policy focuses attention on what is actually done as against what is proposed and/or intended. It differentiates a policy from a decision which is a choice among competing alternatives. On the other hand, public policy has been defined as the course of action by government towards an aspect of the economy, including the goals a government seeks to achieve and choices of the methods to pursue those goals. Similarly, Fischer goes further and defines public policy “as political agreement on a course of action, mutually designed to resolve or mitigate problems on a political agenda”. Arguably, whether public policies are arrived at through political deliberations or formal vote, they involve a specification of goals to be pursued as well as the means for achieving them (Anderson <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2003</CitationRef>; Ellis <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">1992</CitationRef>; Fischer <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2003</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Trade policy has been described as a collection of rules and regulations which pertain to trade. Trade, the exchange of goods i.e. the transfer of ownership of goods and products from one owner to another or from one entity to another takes place in a network known as a market. Every nation has some form of trade policy in place, with public officials formulating the policy which they think would be most appropriate for their country. The purpose of this policy is to guide smooth running of a country’s trade by setting clear standards and goals which can be understood by potential trading partners.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In many regions such as Southern Africa, a number of countries come together to formulate policies on mutually beneficial trade laying down rules and regulations that take into consideration each other’s interests, rules and regulations. Such policies include aspects such as import and export taxes, tariffs, inspection regulations, and quotas. A nation’s trade policy attempts to protect their local products and industries with trade policies which restrict importation of goods similar to what they produce so as to allow domestic producers of goods and services to have access to local market without competition (protectionist policies). Two countries may enter into agreement to trade with each other and sign a bilateral trade agreement which is used to improve economic trade imbalances between the two nations. Taxes, tariffs and quotas are often lifted, reduced or restricted on specific goods or services to realign trade deficits and restore economic stability between the two parties. On the other hand, regional trade agreements contain terms and conditions on which the trade relationship among the countries will be based on.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Trade agreements support smooth trading among partners as they take into consideration the interests of participating trade partners who append their signatures to such agreements. Regular meetings may also be held to discuss changes in the financial climate, and to make adjustments to trade policy accordingly. While multilateral trade agreements regulate trade between participating countries without discrimination, they are usually intended to lower trade barriers between participating countries and, as a consequence, increase the degree of economic integration between the participants. Such agreements include security issues as well as issues of product safety to ensure that product conform to standards spelt out by each participating partner. Meanwhile some governments might impose some protectionist policies that support local employment such as imposing tariffs to imports or offer subsidies to exports. Many governments may also restrict free trade to limit export of natural resources through the imposition of import quotas, high taxes and specific regulatory legislation.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Regional trade agreements have a number of advantages including that of lower prices through the reduction of tariffs between the countries which are part of the trade agreement. The World Trade Organization requires regional trade agreements to reduce tariffs between countries, but does not allow these countries to increase tariffs on countries which are not part of the agreement. Tariff reductions allow people to purchase goods from other countries at lower prices. Regional trade agreements also provide trade advantages for all countries in a region which improve their worldwide competitiveness, including in the markets of countries not included in the trade agreement. Furthermore, regional trade agreements can encourage other countries that are not part of the trade agreement to reduce their trade barriers.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In recent years, the globalization of markets and the expansion of free-trade agreements have encouraged many areas of the world to consider regional integration as a means to better compete in the world economy. Countries that alone may not have sufficiently large markets for production and consumption join together with regional neighbours in order to create favourable flow of areas where goods and services can flow relatively freely in response to market demand. This gives the region comparative leverage when trading as a unified block of economic activity. Every complex political and economic venture such as regional trade blocks has both advantages and disadvantages.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Regional integration usually allows several different countries to come together and form common markets. This is done by opening up borders and eliminating tariffs and taxes on imports and exports between member nations. Where before it might have been difficult for a manufacturer in country A to find enough demand, it is now able to easily market and sell its products in countries B, C and D, thus allowing it to expand its business. Manufacturers and other firms operating in countries B, C and D can do the same, thus increasing economic activity overall. That in turn raises GDP and if properly managed, this can lead to a better standard of living for all citizens within a regional block. A trading block has the advantage of increased global competitiveness as it enjoys a larger market which allows the internal economic output within the regional block to increase as well as putting the block at an advantage in relation to other countries around the world. Increased economic output and better efficiency through free trade across borders allows the regional block to offer many more goods and services on the international market than competitors.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The disadvantages include the loss of sovereignty as member nations give up some of their sovereignty to the newly created supranational body such as a regional parliament or council. This body will have to be entrusted to make binding decisions which affect every member country, effectively subordinating some national legislative and executive power to that body. This means that member countries may no longer be able to enact policies that meet their specific needs and interest, especially if such policies would come into conflict with regional initiatives. A transparent system governing the appointment of members to such regional bodies is a necessity to uphold democracy and accountability. Lack of transparency could create the perception unfair control.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Furthermore, regional integration can make it difficult for national governments to create and implement policies based on their own particular needs. This can be problematic when the specific economic conditions within a member country require actions such as adjusting the money supply or increasing public debt in order to finance infrastructure development or entitlements. These policies, while necessary for one member nation, could skew the economies of other member nations, especially if there is a unified currency. Additionally, poorer member countries may pull down the richer members as they may have to bail out the poorer members. Currency devaluation by the poorer member countries could jeopardise the whole regional economy as regional integration binds member countries together during times of prosperity and hard times.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Among the issues that emerged from the UN World summit held in Johannesburg, South Africa during 2002 included the need to strengthen decision-making and harnessing science and technology that would facilitate the management of linkages to the global economy and overcoming obstacles to reforms on the social dimension of sustainable development. Solutions were envisioned to lie with making markets work for sustainable development through adjusting prices and instituting regulations which allow imposing market-based instruments such as taxes and tradable permit systems (World Summit <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>

        <Section1 ID="Sec2">
          <Heading>International Institutions</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Internationally there are several institutions which have been put into place to provide guidance on aspects to be taken into consideration during the formulation of policies and legislations governing marketing and trade among countries. These include the World Customs Organization (WCO) which is the intergovernmental organization exclusively focused on Customs matters. The WCO particularly works in the areas covering the development of global standards, the simplification and harmonization of Customs procedures, trade supply chain security, the facilitation of international trade, the enhancement of Customs enforcement and compliance activities, anti-counterfeiting and piracy initiatives, public-private partnerships, integrity promotion, and sustainable global Customs capacity building programs. The WCO also maintains the international Harmonized System Goods Nomenclature, and administers the technical aspects of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements on Customs Valuation and Rules of Origin. By promoting the emergence of an honest, transparent and predictable Customs environment, the WCO directly contributes to the economic and social well-being of its Members. The WCO’s mission is to enhance the protection of society and the national territory, and to secure and facilitate international trade (WTO <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Another institution put in place to provide guidance on trade policy and legislation formulation is the Harmonized System Goods Nomenclature (HS) The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System generally referred to as “Harmonized System” or simply “HS” which is a multipurpose international product nomenclature developed by WCO. It comprises about 5,000 commodity groups; each identified by a six digit code, arranged in a legal and logical structure that is supported by well-defined rules to achieve uniform classification. The system is used by more than 200 countries and economies as a basis for their Customs tariffs and for the collection of international trade statistics. Over 98 % of the merchandise in international trade is classified in terms of the HS. The HS contributes to the harmonization of Customs and trade procedures, and the non-documentary trade data interchange in connection with such procedures, thus reducing the costs related to international trade. It is also extensively used by governments, international organizations and the private sector for many other purposes such as internal taxes, trade policies, monitoring of controlled goods, rules of origin, freight tariffs, transport statistics, price monitoring, quota controls, compilation of national accounts, and economic research and analysis. The HS is thus a universal economic language and code for goods, and an indispensable tool for international trade (WCO <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The HS is governed by “The International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System”. The official interpretation of the HS is given in the Explanatory Notes (five volumes in English and French) published by the WCO. The Explanatory Notes form part of a commodity database giving the HS classification of more than 200,000 commodities actually traded internationally. The maintenance of the HS is a WCO priority. This activity includes measures to secure uniform interpretation of the HS and its periodic updating in light of developments in technology and changes in trade patterns. The WCO manages this process through the Harmonized System Committee (representing the Contracting Parties to the HS Convention) which examines policy matters, takes decisions on classification questions, settles disputes and prepares amendments to the Explanatory Notes. The HS Committee also prepares amendments updating the HS regularly. Decisions concerning the interpretation and application of the Harmonized System, such as classification decisions and amendments to the Explanatory Notes or to the Compendium of Classification Opinions, become effective soon after the approval by the HS Committee.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">WTO Agreement on Customs Valuation formally known as the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 established a customs valuation system that primarily bases the customs value on the transaction value of imported goods which is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the country of importation plus certain adjustments of costs and charges. It constitutes the taxable basis for customs duties. It is also an essential element for compiling trade statistics, monitoring quantitative restrictions, applying tariff preferences, and collecting national taxes. Imported goods are valued in terms of the provisions of the WTO Agreement on Customs Valuation. The Agreement is intended to provide a single system that is fair, uniform and neutral for the valuation of imported goods for Customs purposes, conforming to commercial realities and outlawing the use of arbitrary or fictitious Customs values. The Agreement, by its positive concept of value, recognizes that Customs valuation should, as far as possible, be based on the actual price of the goods to be valued.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">WTO Agreement on Rules of Origin provides transparency to regulations and practices regarding Rules of Origin, with the main purpose of preventing unnecessary obstacles to the flow of international trade. The Agreement establishes a platform for harmonizing Non-Preferential Rules of Origin. The main goal is to bring about further liberalization and expansion of world trade. The other motivation is to impose very precise disciplines on the application of Rules of Origin both now (transition period) and after the harmonization of Non-Preferential Rules of Origin. Under the Agreement, Members are obliged to adhere to the following disciplines:-

          <Para TextBreak="No">Technically, regulatory laws are applied to a dynamic competitive market with the aim of achieving an objective which the market cannot reach alone either because there is a technical problem such as the lack of an essential infrastructure or where it is necessary to impose a structure for the common good of the national economy. The regulatory system of a particular market such as that involving trading of agricultural products facilitates the realization of specific objectives such as enabling access to products by the consumers and/or industries. In order to achieve this objective, the regulatory system must have specific rules and regulations due to the linkage that exist between laws and regulations which often leads to the setting up of specific institutions to serve as regulators. Technically, a regulatory system essentially takes into account the specificity of products which influences the rules and regulations surrounding those products.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">While setting up regulatory mechanisms for certain products, it should be appreciated that inadequate understanding of supply and demand for agricultural products as well as inadequate handling and processing of these products could lead to dangerous outcomes and therefore food safety has to be accorded proper consideration when setting up a regulatory system. The necessity for a regulatory system can arise because some products which are vital for people living in certain geographical and social conditions are not easily accessible to them. A regulatory system is therefore necessary to overcome breakdowns in the production chain of agricultural products to avoid universal risks. Furthermore, demand for agricultural products is closely linked to culture and consumers’ eating habits. This should be taken into account when designing a regulatory system; likewise, the agricultural activity itself which is part of land development should be linked to regulatory systems for other sectors such as environment, tourism, mining, energy, transportation and telecommunications.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It is therefore prudent to set up regulatory policies that are not a set of exceptions but rather taking full cognizance of specific rules shaped by the technical specificity of a product and its market conditions; the main purpose being to understand the conditions of the suppler while targeting satisfaction of the consumer. For example, in terms of setting up a commercial system providing wider access to certain agricultural products, a long-term production policy with great transparency on the nominal nature of products in circulation is necessary. In the same way, the interactions between the agricultural sector, water regulatory systems, health policies and the protection of innovative medicines call for “inter-regulatory” systems, that take into consideration several aims and interactions in the decision-making in each sector. Consequently, a regulatory system must be set up with political and technical requirements in mind because the functioning of this system depends on the policies governing the production and distribution of given commodities. Harmonious policies and regulations would guarantee the success of a specific regulation governing agricultural marketable goods.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Various countries around the globe have devised regulatory systems to manage the entry and exit of agriculture related products in such a manner that the agriculture sectors of their countries are protected, sustained and developed to serve wide-ranging national interests. These are either in the form of food security, plant and animal health, industrial development, trade development or safeguarding national sovereignty.</Para>

          <Heading>Africa and SADC</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Many countries in Africa have since the 1990s been dismantling government controls and converting to market-based food systems, believing that market reforms would enhance farm profitability through their positive effects on prices, investment levels, and commercialization. In fact, the need for such agrarian reforms, including commercialization of the smallholder production systems, received considerable attention from governments and development organizations, including SADC states. However, the results of the reform programs were mixed and frequently inconsistent with the expected increases in productivity. It was then realized that the sector-based reform prescriptions in many cases had been based upon superficial knowledge of the prevailing economic institutions and how they affect economic outcome in particular economies. It was then appreciated that it was prudent to go beyond generalizations so that property rights, market rules and exchange mechanisms were required to actually conduct pragmatic applied research on the specific kinds of property rights, rules, and exchange arrangements that would most contribute to the development of markets among states (Muchopa et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2004</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Globalization, a major influence on the development of institutions, should be considered when designing policies and legislations governing markets including markets for agricultural products. The globalization process, fuelled by such forces as the simultaneous opening of financial capital markets and the dismantling of closed trade in agricultural commodities, raises questions about the links between natural resources, government, household and private sector strategies and the economic welfare of a country or group of countries. If the globalization process and the creation of the correct institutions are to be the catalyst for economic growth and development in emerging and developed markets, then understanding these links is crucial. This calls for a fundamental review of the whole basis for policies that regulate agricultural investment and marketing in SADC (Muchopa et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2004</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The objectives of SADC include the achievement of development and economic growth, alleviation of poverty, enhancement of standard and quality life and support socially disadvantaged groups through regional integration. These objectives are to be achieved through the implementation of various protocols agreed upon to guide each cooperation area. The SADC Protocol on Trade calls for trade liberalization, the elimination of trade barriers and of import and export duties, harmonization with the trading practices of the WTO and SPS information management system (SPS IMS). The SPS IMS sets out basic rules on how governments can apply food safety and animal and plant health measures. The system allows users to track and obtain information on measures that member governments have notified the WTO (an obligation for WTO members), specific trade concerns, documents of the WTO’s SPS Measures Committee, member governments’ national enquiry points and their authorities handling notification. Through the liberalization schedules of each Member States, a free trade area has been established within SADC to allow freer movement of goods within the region (SADC <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2006a</CitationRef>).</Para>

Regional financial integration is an economic and political process whereby capital and financial markets are increasingly integrated and capital is able to freely cross the intra-regional borders. These include the elimination of barriers and constraints to regional capital mobility, adoption of regionally integrated payment systems and harmonization of regulatory and supervisory frameworks. Other relevant protocols entered into include the SADC Protocol on Transport, Communication and Meteorology which aims to establish transport, communications and meteorology systems which provide efficient, cost-effective and fully integrated infrastructure and operations, which best meet the needs of customers and promote economic and social development while being environmentally and economically sustainable (SADC <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">1996</CitationRef>).</Para>

SACU Member States, with the exception of South Africa may, as a temporary measure, levy additional duties on goods imported into its area to enable infant industries in its area to meet competition from other industries in other SACU countries. The SACU Agreement also calls upon Member States to cooperate in the application of regulations for agricultural products marketing and consult from time to time in matters affecting the production and consumption of agricultural commodities. It requires Member States to consult on matters affecting the improvements of such commodities.

It is thus the highest public private partnership institution on international trade and investment matters. The rational for its establishment was that at the time, private sector input and government feedback into the process of international trade and investment was on a case by case basis lacking uniformity and therefore needed systematization and formality.

The forum serves as the mouthpiece for the whole value adding chain of agricultural products, with participation of producer and processor organizations, marketing boards, research institutions and representatives of the line ministries involved in trade issues. The objective of the forum is to advance and strengthen agricultural production and processing sectors in order to promote these sectors in national, regional and international trade relations and negotiations in a transparent way. This is done, amongst others, by promoting private sector participation in making inputs to the national trade process, formulating and presenting the opinion and negotiation proposals of the private agricultural sector in trade and trade-related matters to the line Ministries involved in trade negotiations.

NNFU promotes active participation of the small scale producers in the design and drafting of conducive and enabling policy environment related to agriculture, water, land, credit among other needs. NNFU facilitates the implementation of national policies, acts and legislations; implementation of projects and schemes and serves as a conveyer belt between farming communities country-wide and service delivery institutions. NNFU is involved in institutional strengthening in order to create vibrancy at grass-root level that allows for complimentary actions.</Para>

          <Heading>Food Trade Overview</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Namibia has a sizable market for agricultural and agro-industrial products that was valued at more than N$5 billion (computation from the National Account, 2000–2008). Of this, local industries have a market share of around one-third. During this time, the main local visible products included agricultural products such as livestock-based (cattle, goats, sheep, pigs and poultry) and crops and horticulture-based (including maize, wheat, cabbage, watermelon, potatoes, tomatoes, onion, grapes, dates, mangoes). On the agro-industrial side, products included processed meat (chilled, dried, canned); dairies; leather products; flour; confectioneries; oil; beer and beverage as well as spirit and wine. Animal products, live animals, and crop exports constituted roughly 10.7 % of total exports. The majority of inputs for primary production in the agriculture sector such as equipment and machineries, veterinary medicine and food supplements, are imported. Meanwhile, the government encourages retailers of fruits, vegetables, and other crop products to source 30 % of their stock from local farmers (Namibia Statistical Agency <CitationRef CitationID="CR005">2013</CitationRef>; Annual Statistics Bulletin <CitationRef CitationID="CR006">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">During the period 2000–2008, out of top 25 export products, only 20 % had undergone some degree of processing, and even fewer that could be regarded as at a final phase of value addition. Conversely, of the agricultural and agriculture-related products imported, 80 % were in processed form, which demonstrates the domination of the local market by processed agricultural imports. This fact supports the fact that there is a high demand for agricultural products which, if taken advantage of could support the growth of the development of local agricultural processing industries. Thus the limited range of Namibia’s agro-industrial products is testimony to the fact that there is room for increasing this range through value addition to a wide range of agricultural produce which would stabilize agricultural trade for the local farmers as it is common knowledge that value added agro-industrial products are less price volatile to international shocks than raw agricultural produce (Annual Statistics Bulletin <CitationRef CitationID="CR006">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">For example, it emerges that during 2008–2009 periods, Namibia had a negative balance of trade in agricultural products, averaging more than N$1 billion. In 2009, Namibia imported agricultural products valued at N$5.9 billion versus export value of N$4.6 billion. This translates into an agricultural trade deficit of N$1.3 billion. A glimpse at Namibia’s exports and imports over a series of years illustrates a state of the agricultural industry with a high potential, but with marginal exploitation of such potential for the benefit of the country and its citizens Namibia (Namibia Statistical Agency <CitationRef CitationID="CR005">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">During 2008–2009 periods, Namibia exported various agricultural products which averaged more than 500 products lines at the six-digit HS code level. In 2009, the top export products included malted beer, live bovine animals, meat (fresh, chilled and frozen), fresh grapes, sheep/lamb carcasses (fresh and chilled), fermented beverages, live goats, no-alcoholic beverages, spirit and wine. The main export markets included countries within SADC region (South Africa and Angola); European Union (United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland) and Norway as well as the United States of America (USA). Namibia, with the facilitation of her competent authorities, has been able to meet the technical sanitary and phytosanitary requirements for her exports to those countries. China is emerging as a major viable market; the challenge now is to attain certification and eligibility to retain old markets and accessing and taking advantage of new export markets. During the same periods, the range of imported agricultural and agro-industrial products was close to 600 lines at six-digit HS code level of which sugar and confectionery, cigarette, frozen chicken, non-roasted malt, malted beer and prepared food featured prominently. Over 80 % of agricultural products are imported from or via South Africa (Namibia Statistical Agency <CitationRef CitationID="CR005">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It is reported in the media and various other documents that the agricultural regulation system in Namibia is operating with government intervention through the established statutory boards. The boards are supposed to advise and protect the interests of role players in the agriculture value chain through the enacted various legislations. However, it is reported that the current regulatory arrangements for some sub-sectors are made complicated and mostly favoring main role prayers, thus making the system non-transparent and difficult to achieve the set national objectives as highlighted in Vision 2030, National Development Plan and the National Agriculture Policy (NAP). Regulatory institutions such as the Namibian Standards Institution (NSI), Namibia Competition Commission (NCC) and Namibia Board of Trade (NBT) seem minimally involved in the operations of the agriculture sector despite the fact that they have been charged with the responsibilities to develop and enforce laws and standards as well as maintain a competitive domestic market and ensure fair competition against the international business communities.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It is reported that the import and export of controlled grain, grain products and fresh produce from and into Namibia are currently outsourced to Agri-Inspect appointed by the Namibian Agronomic Board in 2008 to monitor and inspect products as listed under the Agronomic Industry Act. This arrangement also applies to the meat industry. Agri-Inspect, a South African company is working closely with government structures in South Africa, United State, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Swaziland and Namibia. Together with different departments and bodies, its services include market protection, investigations of illegal imports, quality control, data collection and economic analysis to ensure that the dumping of commodities do not have a negative impact specific on the South African market.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It is thus safe to conclude that Namibia heavily depends on trade through which she imports food products to meet the shortfall in her locally produced foods. Currently, Namibia is meeting its grain requirements through annual local production and imports. About 50 % of her annual grain consumption is locally produced, the shortfall of local production made up of imports. Namibia imports about 50 % of her maize needs; 75 % of wheat and about 37 % her Pearl Millet (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Mahangu</Emphasis>) annual requirement. She imports 75 % of pork, 70 % of chicken, 50 % of milk, 75 % of cheeses and 90 % of her butter requirements. She also imports 65 % of all fruit and vegetables as well as 100 % of her sugar requirements. Most of the food imports are sourced from the major food producing countries in SADC including South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe and a few others from outside SADC including Brazil, EU member states, the USA and a few others. On the other hand Namibia exports Namibia exports about 80 % of all its beef, 90 % of all its lamb and sheep and about 95 % of all its goats. Further, Namibia exports about 95 % of all fish caught in Namibian waters (Hoffmann <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Most of the maize is imported from the Republic of South Africa; some maize is imported from Zambia and sometimes from Zimbabwe. This imported maize is used as both staple food and as animal and chicken feed. It is beneficial to import maize from SACU member states because of the customs union which affords no internal trade barriers to its Member States. Wheat on the other hand is sourced from outside SACU trading block because all SACU member States are net importers of wheat. The quality of the Namibian wheat harvest has to be blended with Hard red Winter wheat of the USA and A4 wheat of the EU to give it the required quality of wheat flour that meets Namibian market demand. A small quantity of pearl millet (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Mahangu</Emphasis>) is imported from India to augment the locally produced quantity to meet commercial <Emphasis Type="Italic">Mahangu</Emphasis> needs (Hoffmann <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">On the other hand, until 2013, the dairy sector was totally unprotected so that about 50 % of the UHT and fresh milk was imported from South Africa as well nearly all the butter and cheese requirements of the Namibian market. Currently most of butter and most of cheese products are imported from South Africa; small quantities are (about 10 % of total requirements) are imported from the EU. However, the Government has started tightening import regulations on dairy products such as milk to afford some protection to the local industry. Similarly, in the pork sector, most of the Namibian requirements are imported from South Africa just like sugar requirements. Research efforts made to reverse this situation revealed that the capacity of any sugar mill to be profitable must have a capacity of 150,000 t of sugar per year, and that would create a surplus and locally produced sugar will not be a cheaper alternative (Hoffmann <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Prior to 2012, 70 % of all chicken was imported from South Africa in a frozen state. However, a Namibian based company is producing chicken locally which is hoped will satisfy the local demand. The Namibian Agronomic Board in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture Water and Forestry have embarked on a drive to increase the share of locally produced horticultural produce and it is hoped that this will be carried out until about 65 % of all Namibian requirements are satisfied out of own production. However, rainfall unreliability and water scarcity is a threatening this drive. It suffices to note here that the majority of small-scale producers are self sufficient in their food requirements due to the fact that their diet highly determined by the availability of the foods they produce and/or harvest from the indigenous plant resources (Iita <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2012</CitationRef>; Hoffmann <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">While Namibia will continue to rely heavily on trade to fortify her food security, the Government recently created national strategic food reserves (Silos) with a storage capacity of 11,000 t, representing 3.5 % of annual national consumption. Fresh produce outlets have also been put up to prolong the life of horticultural produce. Livestock production, an important agricultural sector as livestock and livestock products provide a major source of food and income for the majority of the population is also receiving concerted efforts to stabilize it. Moreover, Namibia is vigorously working towards self-sufficiency in food production through support to the Green schemes and other undertakings discussed in detail in Chaps. <ExternalRef>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Nevertheless, it must be appreciated that despite the concerted efforts being made, there are great constraints that face the country which dictate that Namibia continue to depend on food imports. These include the harsh climatic conditions characterized by unreliable and unpredictable rainfall, recurrent droughts and the fact that it will take a very long time (if ever) for Namibia to be self sufficient in all grains such as rice and wheat which are emerging as minor but important staples because these as well as sugar-cane have high water requirements, a very scarce resource for Namibia. The other constraint is affecting fruit and vegetable production which can only be feasibly produced in Namibia to meet up to 65 % of total demand of the formal sector. Thus all these commodities have to be imported for the foreseeable future while promoting indigenous vegetables and fruit tree domestication.</Para>
