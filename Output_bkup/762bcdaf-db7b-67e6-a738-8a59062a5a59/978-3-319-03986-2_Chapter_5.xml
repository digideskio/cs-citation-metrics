          <Para TextBreak="No">Sociological theories provide frameworks and insights that allow for the systemisation of knowledge of the social world. This is why theory is fundamental in empirical investigation and the scientific explanation of events. This is the first of the four chapters on sociological theoretical underpinning in health studies. The starting point is the functionalist perspective which is dated to the works of August Comte, Emile Durkheim, Herbert Spencer, and many other scholars. The chapter discusses this realist perspective, showing the basic features of functionalism as a positivist, nomothetic, deterministic, and macroscopic tradition. The chapter then discusses three classical and substantive theories of functionalism in medical sociology, including the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Sick Role</Emphasis> by Talcott Parsons; <Emphasis Type="Italic">Suicide</Emphasis> by Emile Durkheim; and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Social Capital Theory of Health</Emphasis>. The features and criticisms of the sick role are discussed. The major idea of the Durkheimian perspective is the understanding of mortality through suicide by emphasising the social determinants that play major roles in suicide. Social capital is discussed as a major social resource that can help promote health.</Para>

          <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The definition of medical sociology depicts the application of sociological theories in the understanding of human health and illness. This and the next three chapters are devoted to the examination of sociological perspectives or theories. Sociological theory<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Sociological theory</Primary>
              <Secondary>definition</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm> is defined as a set of interrelated ideas that allow for the systemisation of knowledge of the social world (Ritzer <CitationRef CitationID="CR55">2010</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Ritzer, G.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Sociological perspectives or theories involve frameworks and insights derived from empirical observations and systematic reasoning about the social world. The theories focus on structural relationships and factors and consider individuals to be embodied (social) agents patterned to create and recreate the social world. Such perspectives are then used to understand, explain or interpret, control, and predict social phenomena and human society in general. Ritzer (<CitationRef CitationID="CR56">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Ritzer, G.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> observed that a paradigm differentiates one scientific community from the other because there are usually many paradigms within a field of study. This is also true for sociology as a multi-paradigm social science discipline. Sociologists use different perspectives in the analysis of social issues.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Neuman (<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2011</CitationRef>, p. 81)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Neumam, W.L.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> defines a paradigm<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Paradigm</Primary>
              <Secondary>definition</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm> as “a general organising framework for theory and research that includes basic assumptions, key issues, models of quality research, and methods for seeking answers.” By implication, a paradigm may suggest what can be studied, how it will be studied, and how data will be interpreted. What is problematic for one paradigm may not be for another. The perspective used may also determine the results obtained. It is always important for sociologists to situate their studies within appropriate theoretical orientation. Since sociological research is a scientific endeavour, the assumptions and principles provided by a theory will structure the research ideas, data gathering, and interpretation of findings within a specific domain. Apart from theoretical explanations, sociologists also rely on observational explanations of events. In sum, sociologists produce a body of knowledge based on theoretical and empirical facts. The multiple paradigms in sociology add great scientific value to the discipline. One perspective may demonstrate intellectual superiority on one issue more than the other. Continuous empirical findings provide opportunities for modification of existing paradigms. This means that the perspectives are not static.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In sociology, there are three major perspectives or paradigms, which include functionalist, conflict<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Conflict</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, and interpretive perspectives. Each of the perspectives includes a number of substantive or middle-range theories<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Middle-range theories</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. These also represent categories of theories usually invoked in sociology to explain social issues. It is important to note that theory and research are very key in sociological imagination or enterprising. Theories are usually tested and validated or debunked as adequate coherent ideas to explain social phenomena. Theories often show patterns and motivations of behaviour using various concepts. This helps sociologists in conceptual analysis and interpreting data based on the theoretical orientation. While there are a number of theories, there is no strict attachment to any particular theory or theoretical orientation. The selection of a perspective depends on the problem and the context from which the problem will be studied. In fact, the goal of research might be to test a particular theory—to know whether the theory is relevant in explaining a problem among certain groups.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">While it has been argued that most sociological studies require a theory, it is important to note that a whole paradigm cannot form a theoretical framework of a particular research topic. A paradigm consists of a number of theories with each providing divergent explanations. That two theorists are functionalists does not mean that they have similar conceptual agreement or even point of view. Sociologists often apply middle-range theories or substantive theories<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Substantive theories</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> in empirical investigations. These are particular models or explanations carved out of a broader perspective; some are specifically formulated to be applied in a subdiscipline such as medical sociology. For instance, Parsonian sick role<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Sick role</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is a good example of a substantive model or theory in medical sociology. The theory is derived from the functionalist perspective and from the numerous works of the American sociologist, Talcott Parsons. Apart from this, there are other various models (e.g., Suchman’s illness behaviour model, Chrisman’s or Igun’s stages of the health-seeking process, and the health belief model)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Health Belief Model (HBM)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> derived from empirical investigation that can be applied in medical sociology<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Secondary>Chrisman’s</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm>. Having provided this little background, discussion on the perspectives will start with functionalism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Heading>The Functionalist Perspective: A General Overview</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Functionalism (also known as the consensus paradigm) is a body of theories in social sciences<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Social sciences</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> in general. It is particularly the oldest theoretical tradition in sociology. It is dated to the works of August Comte (1798–1857)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Comte, A.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, who coined sociology in 1838; <Emphasis Type="Italic">Positive Philosophy</Emphasis> (Comte <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">1896</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Primary>Functionalism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is an approach that uses organismic analogy<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Organismic analogy</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> to explain human societies and social phenomena. The central concern of functionalism is how to maintain social order<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Social order</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, equilibrium, or stability in human society. Social order means a state of normality in human society, especially when social institutions are functional and maintained for the continuous benefits and existence of the society (Amzat and Omololu <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2012</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Amzat, J.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>
            <IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Omololu, F.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. It is important to understand the philosophical, epistemological, and intellectual foundations of functionalism. Functionalism grew with the rise of empiricism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Empiricism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, rationalism, and, in general, the scientific revolution. First, functionalism is a realist tradition<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Realist tradition \t see Realism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. The realists (also called essentialists or objectivists) believe in the reality of social existence and phenomena. To them, whatever exists is real and can be studied objectively and empirically. Health problems are a part of the realities of social existence. To study an event objectively implies that value detachment is possible. The researcher can always be objective and systematic in carrying out investigation. Realism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Realism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> promotes value-free science, which means that social research should be conducted in an objective manner based on empirical evidence without interference of moral and political values.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Functionalists also hold that social processes are determined, grounded on the principle of cause-effect<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Cause-effect \t see Determinism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> (or deterministic) assumption that whatever happens has a cause. Science in general and empirical works in particular flow from the deterministic assumption. The primary endeavour of science is to understand causality. It is only when the cause is understood that scientists can understand the effects—without cause, there is no effect. Functionalism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Functionalism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, like other approaches in science, believes in multiple causalities<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Multiple causality</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. A particular phenomenon can be attributed to many causal and intervening factors. The implication of this deterministic assumption in understanding human behaviour is that there are external and coercive factors responsible for human actions and behaviour. Particularly to the functionalists, the social norms, values and positions, and conditions greatly determine human behaviour. The social processes are fraught with expectations. Hence behaviour emerged in the process of meeting expectations and fulfilling social imperatives. Roles are randomly allocated, and all roles are functional for the survival of the society. Individuals cannot actually be held accountable for their own position. This distribution of social position is random without the influence of individuals. Sometimes, this deterministic approach is called the mechanical model of man.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Furthermore, functionalism is part of the perspective that signifies that sociology is a scientific endeavour because of the reliance on positivism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Positivism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Comte (<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">1896</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Comte, A.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, Spencer (<CitationRef CitationID="CR60">1896</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Spencer, H.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, and Durkheim (<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">1895</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Durkheim, E.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> recommended that the application of scientific methodology should be the <Emphasis Type="Italic">modus operandi</Emphasis> of sociology. The discipline must be based on systematic empirical understanding of social events and to produce a body of knowledge based on precise and verifiable evidence. This is why the primary task of sociology is to produce universal laws to explain human action and behaviour. Comte (<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">1896</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Comte, A.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> in <Emphasis Type="Italic">Positive Philosophy</Emphasis> advocated that sociology should employ experimental, observational, and comparative methods in the understanding of its subject matter. This positivist agenda illustrates the reliance of sociology on coherent and structured theoretical and empirical stance. The structured procedural approach further promotes the close association between medical sociology and medicine. This is because, like in medical sciences, empirical findings to a large extent can be verified, falsified, or refuted and replicated, mainly because sociology relies or adopts methods from the pure sciences.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">As previously mentioned, sociologists tend to generate universal laws to explain human action and behaviour. It relies on generalisation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Generalisation</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> often called the nomothetic approach. With the use of scientific methods, it is possible for sociologists to generalise and provide a general basis for actions and interventions. Functionalism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Functionalism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> relies on nomothetic assumption<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Nomothetic assumption</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, which is also made possible because of a macro level of analysis. Functionalists focus more on groups or the social aggregate. Data are obtained from a group with the use of random sampling and the findings are considered valid for the group or community. The macro or macroscopic<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Macroscopic</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> level of analysis involves social phenomena that are relatively large in size, such as societies, groups, religion<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Religion</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, culture, social class, organisation, and institutions. The sample size is often large to ensure validity and reliability. More so, the functionalists rely on objectivity and study events at the objective level. Objectivity<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Objectivity</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> implies value-neutrality. This is a major crux in science because without it, scientific knowledge will be largely biased and easily refutable. Objective level relates to the externality of events. Social events (human behaviour and society) can be studied and measured like “things” in the pure sciences.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">What then are the methodological implications of these philosophical and epistemological foundations? A functionalist approach is closely linked with a quantitative approach, questionnaire design, experimentation, randomisation, probability sampling<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Probability sampling</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, objectivity, generalisation, large sample size, statistical analysis (both descriptive and inferential), and, generally, systematic research designs. The use of statistical models and analysis play a central role in generalisation. Probability sampling is usually used in quantitative research. There are various other specific methods from the positivist tradition used in sociology. These issues are easy to deduce because of functionalism’s positivist orientation.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Functionalism has some specific views as shown in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">5.1</InternalRef>. It is important to understand some of these foundational features before explaining some substantive theories<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Substantive theories</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> of functionalism. There are also divergent views in functionalism. The attempt here is to explain some of the general features of functionalism. It should be noted that there is no absolute consensus on some of the attributes. For instance, Robert K. Merton is a critical functionalist, who criticised most of the assumptions of functionalism. Despite that, there is a lot of common ground.</Para>

They all contribute to the survival and existence of the biological organism. The parts of the social organism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Social organism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> include institutions such as family, political, economic, religious, educational, and marriage institutions. All of these parts also function for the survival of the society. They play differential and specialised functions. If one part is malfunctioning, all other parts will be affected. If the family institution is not stable, it will adversely affect other institutions.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The essence of various parts is to fulfil the functional imperatives, prerequisites, or needs of the social systems (Ritzer <CitationRef CitationID="CR56">2011</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm>. Society has some needs that must be fulfilled. Society needs to regulate its affairs; that is why there is a political institution to do so. Society needs to produce goods and services for its members, which is the function of the economic institution. These functions are fundamental for the survival of the society. Problems in human society often manifest from inadequate adaptive processes and deviation of some members of the society. Such problems often suggest the need for adjustment within the system. Invariably, the problems are also functional even though the society must at all times keep them at the basic minimal level in order to prevent them from inflicting unbearable social burden. Events (e.g., health problems) that do not contribute positive function for the survival of the society are dysfunctional. Using the terms functionality and dysfunctionality<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Dysfunctionality</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, a health problem is functional because it suggests a task for the health institution and it is dysfunctional because it inflicts pain on some members of the society.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Generally, the functionalists view health as a prerequisite for the smooth functioning of society while illness is a form of deviance. Health is a social value and every society needs it for survival and development. Illness is a form of infraction on the ability of the individual to carry out daily activities.

            </IndexTerm> observed that illness indicates a failure to conform to societal expectations and norms in some way. It is thus an unnatural state of the human body, causing both physical and social dysfunction, and therefore must be alleviated as soon as possible. The functional role of the medical practitioners or health care institution as a subsystem (in the whole social system) is to help in the control of disease, especially by helping people to get well and return to their normal roles in the society. Having highlighted some basic foundations of functionalism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </ExternalRef>, most of the founding fathers of sociology were not particular about substantive areas of sociology but rather a general development of sociology as a discipline. This is why it took time to get the first major contribution directly related to medical sociology. It is important to start with the first acknowledged explicit sociological work in medical sociology which is the “sick role” developed by Talcott Parsons in 1951.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Talcott Parsons (1902–1979) was an American sociologist and a structural functionalist. He analysed the works of Comte, Spencer, Durkheim, and Weber (among others), and he was particularly influenced by the ideas of these founding fathers of sociology. In his major work, <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Social System</Emphasis> published in 1951, Parsons introduced the concept of the sick role<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                <Primary>Place</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> of medical sociology in the mainstream of sociology. The model was primary designed to explain illness behaviour. Like other functionalists, Parsons was interested in value consensus and social order<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Social order</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. His key focus is how social interaction/action produce social order. Parsons sought to analyse individual behaviour in the context of large-scale social systems<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> observed that the onset of illness was of interest to Parsons because it prevented the fulfilment of social roles, such as paid employment and parental duties. Illness is “one of the most important withdrawal behaviours in our society” (Parsons <CitationRef CitationID="CR49">1951</CitationRef>, p. 31)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Parsons, T.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. Parsons argued that the ill take on a sick role, which (like all roles) provides them with a set of responsibilities and privileges (Emke <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2002</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Emke, I.</Primary>

                <Primary>Persons</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> in certain positions. Like there are a number of roles attached to the position of a father, the sick role depicts the social position of the sick in the society and the expectations attached. There are expectations and obligations for them as well as for normal individuals in the society. This is why the concept is called the sick role or, put the other way around, the roles of the sick.

              </IndexTerm> identified four aspects of the institutionalised expectation system relative to the sick role. The first two aspects are rights of the patients while the last are duties<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The physician is usually the one to legitimise this right.

Here, Parsons identified the critical roles of significant others<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                      </IndexTerm> in recognition of ill-health and social referral for appropriate care. Parsons observed that the essence of legitimation has the social function of protection against “malingering”<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                      </IndexTerm> a social pretence of being sick to claim excuse from roles and expectations. The implication is that it is possible for certain individual to avoid responsibilities and thus the sick role also serves as a mechanism of social control.</Para>

In other words, the sick person cannot be expected to get better on her/his own but has the right to (medical) assistance. In Parsons’ words, “… the sick person cannot be expected by ‘pulling himself together’ to get well by an act of decision or will.” He or she needs support in the process of getting well. The importance of seeking medical and social assistance is stressed. This creates a state of dependence on social capital<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The patient has to seek for appropriate diagnosis from medical experts and submit to their directives, for instance, by providing required samples (e.g., blood or urine).</Para>

            </Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Parsons viewed health from the capability perspective. This is in line with the structural-functionalist principles that health is a functional prerequisite of society (William <CitationRef CitationID="CR66">2005</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>William, S.J.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. The first step is that an individual who is sick has to withdraw from his/her daily roles. For example, he or she might not be able to go to school or work. He is thus entitled to sick-leave. To Parsons, illness is a social deviance because it negates the value expectation of the society. As outlined in the four aspects of sick role<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Sick role</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>, Parsons provided a discussion of illness behaviour as a description of a set of defined roles, norms, and expectations. It is highlighted that for the parties of the illness event, the phases create an avenue for resolution of the event and a return to normal roles in the society (Young <CitationRef CitationID="CR67">2004</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Young, J.T.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. This also accounts for the therapeutic legitimising function of the physician. It can be observed that the sick role is a socially prescribed mechanism for channelling and controlling this deviance called sickness (William <CitationRef CitationID="CR66">2005</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>William, S.J.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. It provides the channel an individual needs to follow in order to return to his/her functional capacity.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Furthermore, while individual entitlement to relief from duties is legitimate, it has to be sanctioned by a competent person, usually the physician. The model recognises the roles of physicians in helping the sick by first relieving their role burden and providing a safety net for their absenteeism (from usual roles). However, this should not promote malingering<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Malingering</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>, as the next stage stipulates that an individual has to develop the motivation to get better and also seek competent help. Parsons (1951, p. 440)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Parsons, T.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> noted that “the urgency of the need of help will vary with the severity of the disability, suffering, and risk of death or serious, lengthy or permanent disablement.” The fault of the illness is not placed on the patient, but he or she has the responsibility to seek the appropriate channels to get well and cooperate with the competent persons<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Persons</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> in the process. He/she has to keep appointments and comply with a therapeutic regimen.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Another major primary aim of Parsons for discussing medical practice and the sick role is the reflection on rational action and modern values. Parsons (1951, p. 432)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                <Primary>Social system</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> for coping with the illnesses of its members. It involves a set of institutionalised roles, which are guided by principles and values of the society. This is why a medical institution earns its place in the social structure, for its distinct contribution to the functional existence of every individual in the social system.

              <Para TextBreak="No">Since the conception of the theory in 1951, it has been heavily criticised. While Parsons provided a universal and ideal-type model of the sick role, the nature of illness, sociocultural attributes of the patients have more often than not regulated the role expectations of the sick (Segall <CitationRef CitationID="CR57">1976</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Segall, A.</Primary>

It is as if the patient is helpless and does not have any knowledge, competency, or aspirations in the process of care. This may defy the right to self-determination. The patients also have the right to reject certain treatments based on personal reasons. For instance, a Jehovah’s Witness may reject blood transfusion for religious reasons. This cannot be regarded as a lack of cooperation. The physicians also have to cooperate with the patients.</Para>

The model envisages that the sick role is temporary, but a chronic condition suggests that sickness experience might be lifelong and a person in such condition cannot be exempted from role obligation for life.

              </IndexTerm> is often the starting point and is commonly regarded as the first explicit contribution of one of the key sociological theorists in medical sociology. In fact, Durkheim did not actually aim to contribute to the field of medical sociology but to exercise the empirical relevance of sociology in studying various social phenomena—to develop a general theory of suicide and explicitly explain the “sociology” in suicidal currents. Other subdisciplines in sociology such as social deviance and criminology have extensively focused on the issue of suicide; perhaps suicide is a form of social deviance, and in many countries it is a crime<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Crime</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. But more obviously, and as described by Durkheim, it is about morbidity and mortality—hence the significance of this contribution to the field of medical sociology. Durkheim presents a grand attempt to understand mortality through suicide. Like his other counterparts (Comte, Weber, Marx, and Spencer), he was interested in how to maintain social order<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Social order</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> in human society. An orderly society, at least to a large extent, is devoid of social and structural problems (including health problems) that can deny people access to good life.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Emile Durkheim (1858–1917), a French sociologist, conceived sociology as the scientific study of social facts<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Social facts</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>. In <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Rules of Sociological Method</Emphasis> (first published in 1895 and later in 1982), Durkheim argued that sociology should concentrate on understanding social facts. He viewed social facts as forces and structures that are external to, and coercive of, the individual. Social facts are determinants of human behaviour and actions. As he noted, social facts exist <Emphasis Type="Italic">sui generis</Emphasis>

                <Primary>Sui generis</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>—independent of human mind, as they are not abstractions but objective realities and, as he claimed, must be studied as <Emphasis Type="Italic">things</Emphasis>. Studying social facts is close to studying the social determinants of health<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Social determinants of health (SDH)</Primary>

                <Primary>Ritzer, G.</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> observed that Durkheim reasoned that if he could link an individual behaviour such as suicide to social causes (social facts), he would be able to demonstrate the positivist stance in sociology. Ritzer further noted that Durkheim did not examine why individual <Emphasis Type="Italic">A</Emphasis> or <Emphasis Type="Italic">B</Emphasis> committed suicide<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Suicide</Primary>
              </IndexTerm>; rather, he was interested in the causes of differences in suicide rates among groups, regions, and countries. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Suicide</Emphasis>, first published in 1897 and later in 1951, presents an empirical application of sociological (scientific) methods in the study of a particular form of behaviour called suicide<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                <Primary>Egoistic suicide</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> occurs when an individual has little or no connectedness (cohesion) with others in the social system—the social string is weak or nonexistent. Such individuals are detached from others, sometimes as a result of rejection, inability to fit into any functional role, or, more importantly, the inability to adapt with others and the environment. Egoistic suicide<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Suicide</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> is a manifestation of social alienation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Social alienation</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> and a type of suicide springing from <Emphasis Type="Italic">excessive individualism</Emphasis>. This is why Durkheim observed that individual (selfish) thought and fewer shared practices may predispose individuals to egoistic suicide<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Egoistic suicide</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> (i.e., weakening of common faith positively affects suicide rate). Hence the conclusion is that suicide varies inversely with the degree of integration of the social groups of which the individual forms a part (Durkheim <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">1897</CitationRef>/<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">1951</CitationRef>).</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">On the other hand, a high level of integration (too strong a social string) will lead to <Emphasis Type="Italic">altruistic suicide</Emphasis>

              </IndexTerm>. Little wonder why this could also lead to suicide when it is previously argued that a low level of social integration<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>. The response is simple: too little food is as dangerous as excessive food to human health. In life, no good is measureless: too little and too much are typical extremes that project negative effects. Hence Durkheim submitted that excessive individuation leads to suicide, and insufficient individuation has the same effects. Altruistic suicide could be optional or obligatory as a sign of group loyalty or when a social prestige is attached to suicide, a form of heroism or ultimate sacrifice in a struggle. This is done as a sign of a strong bond an individual has with a group. This form of suicide is mostly perpetuated by fanatics who seek to be martyrs (like terrorists), and among military<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm>. Fatalistic suicide results from excessive regulations. Those who encounter oppressive regulation or discipline, such as the slaves, are more prone to fatalistic suicide. While slavery should be over, unfortunately, there is increasing sex slavery, human trafficking, forced labour, and other forms of exercise of coercion on others which puts them in slavery conditions. Therefore “fatalistic suicide”<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Of course, while Durkheim identified that some psychological dispositions can also account for suicide, he did not explore such factors adequately since that would transcend the focus of sociology.

              </IndexTerm> discussed suicide in relation to social cohesion/integration noting that suicide rates vary according to the level of social bond in human society. Simmel is the proponent of sociation—by which he claimed that human society is an intricate web of multiple relations of individuals in constant interaction with one another (Coser <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2004</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Coser, L.A.</Primary>

                </IndexTerm> by arguing that social resources are embedded in one’s social networks, and because the resources are social in nature, they can only be accessible through one’s direct and indirect ties. Precisely, Lin conceived social capital as resources embedded in one’s social networks. Lin (<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2008</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Lin, N.</Primary>
                </IndexTerm> identified a number of sources for social capital including structural sources (an actor’s characteristics [SES, race, family origin etc.], position and roles in the social hierarchy); and networking sources (strength of tie and network location) (see also Song <CitationRef CitationID="CR58">2013</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Song, L.</Primary>
                </IndexTerm>. Mobilisation of, and accessibility to the resources are, however, also influenced by individual structural position and the strength of network ties (strong or weak) (see Lin <CitationRef CitationID="CR38">1982</CitationRef>, 2008)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

In accessing social resources people tend to direct attention to people of higher status—this implies the use of vertical social capital (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">5.1</InternalRef>). The vertical social capital depicts a weak tie, but which is often more beneficial. “Weak ties rather than strong ties tend to lead to better social resources” (Lin <CitationRef CitationID="CR38">1982</CitationRef>, p. 134)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                </IndexTerm> reiterated that social capital is the set of resources that inhere in family and community relations from which the notions of authority, trust and norms develop, which are forms of social capital. According to Coleman, social capital helps in the development of human capital throughout lifetime—this, invariably, is an extension of the argument that the society makes us human through inculcation of values and norms. Societal values are not independently created and imbibed; it takes the efforts of others. So also, individual goal cannot be independently arrived at, it is interdependently achieved. Coleman described social capital as social-structural resources, which can be defined by their functions. Social capital facilitates certain actions of individuals who are within the structure; and it is productive by enabling the achievement of certain ends.</Para>

The age-grade is a kind of cooperative group, which performs public duties and various self-help activities for the wellbeing of members and community at large. More importantly, African societies are still dominated by the extended family structure. Even when some individuals form a nuclear family system, they still have wide range of responsibilities for close and distance relations. In African context, where social safety nets are inadequate, many families rely on a network of reciprocal assistance provided by members of a larger group: the men support the women or vice versa, the young support the aged, and the employed support the unemployed. Also, there are landlords’ associations in many communities, organised to discuss issues (e.g., sanitation, security, terms of tenancy, and social amenities) affecting the community.</Para>

Social capital is an abundant resource that is often tapped to counterbalance the inadequacy of the formal support systems (e.g., pension, health insurance, paid employment, and public provision of infrastructures). In other words, informal social support or networks often mitigate government failure by promoting welfare in the absence of public services.

                </IndexTerm> have argued that high levels of social capital may act as a buffer in deprived communities, serving to shield them from some of the worst effects of deprivation. Generally, group solidarity and memberships often provide some support, which will invariably facilitate access to valued resources. For instance, network contacts might provide health information<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                </IndexTerm>, which is crucial to disease control and prevention. Also, informal health care and support can be provided in case of illness. Reciprocal support and assistance are part of the bedrock of extended family and communal relationships in African societies. For instance, in case of illness, hospital bills might be contributed; baby-siting assistance can be provided; and cooking, washing and other supportive care might be provided by other family or community members.</Para>

The Figure shows that structural antecedents, which are structural characteristics of a neighborhood or locality, have implications for the type and strength of social ties and resources accessible to individuals (Carpiano <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2007</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

                </IndexTerm>. The structural antecedents include socioeconomic condition of the area and residential stability (length of stay), which invariably affects the level of social connection. The individual confounders or characteristics also affect some structural antecedents—for instance, it determines the area of residence (urban or rural; low or high income area; and the nature of friends).

              <Para TextBreak="No">The individual confounders also affect the level of social capital in terms of social support, leverage and civic participation. For instance, in most Muslim-dominated parts of Africa (including the region of North Africa, Mali, Sudan, Niger, Chad), there are a number of cultural barriers stymieing the presence of women in the public sphere or their (especially married ones) free mingling with the opposite sex. Such condition will limit their civic participation, but which is only one aspect of social capital. Women could receive more support because they are more likely to share their health concerns than men. Men could be disadvantaged in information sharing because of culture of masculinity, which prescribes that men should be strong. In general, Campbell and McLean (<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2004</CitationRef>) argued that social capital is not a homogenous resource equally available to all members of a geographical community, but is shaped and constrained by factors such as gender, ethnicity and social class.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Social capital also involves social leverage, which means the use network ties (especially social influence)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                  <Primary>Social influence</Primary>
                </IndexTerm> for social gains including access to information and social mobility. Informal social control is the ability of individuals or groups (with some form of social links) to ensure conformity to the norms and values of the society—this implies informal measures of behaviour control. Both social leverage and informal social control can exert some influence on health behaviour and risk factors (such as smoking, sedimentary lifestyle and indiscriminate sexual behaviour). For instance, those who belong to some religious networks might desist from some “immoral” practices, which could adversely impact their health status.</Para>

Although, a number of policies or activities rely on volunteering, when other aspects of social capitals (e.g., social, emotional and material supports, and some cognitive aspects [such as trust]) are considered, it could be difficult to implement health policies based on social capital.
