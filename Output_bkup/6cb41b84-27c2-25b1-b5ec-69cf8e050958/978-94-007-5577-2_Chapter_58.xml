              <Para>One of the consequences of the devastating earthquake and the subsequent tsunami close to the Japanese east coast on Friday 11 March 2011 was large cooling problems of the nuclear reactors in Fukushima Daiichi. It resulted in a series of releases of radioactive material into the atmosphere. These releases mainly affected Japan in the vicinity of Fukushima but were also monitored around the northern hemisphere. At FOI a global/regional stochastic particle model has been used to simulate transport and deposition of particulate <Superscript>137</Superscript>Cs and the model results have been compared with measurements at different locations on the northern hemisphere. In the past, the model has been used primarily for dispersion of particles or gases on the European scale. The motive for this study was to investigate the dispersion model behaviour over the whole northern hemisphere and on timescales up to a few weeks. It is important to understand the accurateness of the model and in which way the model result can be used in the emergency preparedness system.</Para>

                <Emphasis Type="Italic">ngitude</Emphasis> coordinate system, is a random displacement model, with dry and wet deposition (using large scale precipitation only). It’s developed at FOI, the Swedish Defence Research Agency [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00581">1</CitationRef>]. For the calculations with dispersion from the Fukushima accident the model had to be adjusted for dispersion on the entire northern hemisphere. Periodic boundary conditions for transport of the particles were included for the east-western boundary and a coordinate transformation was made, in order to avoid singularity in the model, in the North Pole area.</Para>
              <Para>The weather fields driving the model come from ECMWF, <Emphasis Type="Italic">European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts</Emphasis>. A time resolution of 6 h was used for the weather fields. Calculations were made with two different geographical domains, the northern hemisphere (1.0° resolution) and a locally over Japan (0.1° resolution). In the first tests dispersion of particulate <Superscript>137</Superscript>Cs was evaluated using an estimate of the source term [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00582">2</CitationRef>]. It was assumed that the radioactivity was evenly distributed over the surface of the particle already present in the surroundings. Typical particle distributions for urban, rural and maritime air were used in several model calculations. Each distribution is described as a sum of three different log-normal distributions as defined by Guide to Global Aerosol Models [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00583">3</CitationRef>].</Para>

              <Para>For the high resolution geographical domain over Japan the modelled deposition have been compared with deposition measurements of <Superscript>137</Superscript>Cs from MEXT, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Ministry of Education</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Culture</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Sports</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Science</Emphasis> &amp; <Emphasis Type="Italic">Technology in Japan</Emphasis>. The model represents the levels and the location of deposition reasonably well. However, most of the deposition in Japan comes from a rainy period (15–16 March 2011) when the cloud went inland, and since the movement of this is not captured by the 6 h resolution in the weather data, the model shows discrete locations with deposited material. This could be smoothed out by using better time resolution in weather data, which on the other hand would require more computational resources.</Para>
              <Para>There are six air filter stations in Sweden. In Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00581">58.1</InternalRef> a comparison between model data and measurement results for these sites are visualized for the time period when the cloud reaches Sweden, about 11 days after the first release. The timing of the cloud arriving to Sweden is very well described, as well as the order of magnitudes of the concentration of <Superscript>137</Superscript>Cs. Even tendencies are in good agreement between model and measurements. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00581">

              <Para>Comparisons have also been done between the model and air filter measurements in Taiwan Chih-An [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00584">4</CitationRef>]. There was good agreement between the stations at low altitudes.</Para>
              <Para>However, at a site located in the mountains at about 3,000 m height above sea level the model showed between one and two orders of magnitude higher concentrations than the measurements. One aspect of this discrepancy is that our model does not resolve the high mountains in the orography data. Another is the modelling of the boundary layer details in this complex, high terrain. Further work has to be done on how to use the model in these extreme cases.</Para>
              <Para>If we compare the different particle distributions of urban, rural and maritime air there is little difference between them for long distances, see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00582">58.2</InternalRef>. There are greater uncertainties in the model than those that come from the different particle distributions for the long scale modelling, as long as a reasonable distribution is used. The wet deposition is noted to be crucial for these scales i.e. without precipitation the concentration levels in Sweden became 100 times larger due to lack of wash out. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00582">

              <Para>The Pello model is a very useful tool for many purposes in an emergency preparedness situation. The time of arrival is an important decision aid for determining whether to e.g. evacuate people or put cattle inside. The time of arrival shows good agreement between model data and measurement results. Furthermore, the air concentration from the model involves greater uncertainties especially in the early stages of an accident since the source term might be poorly known.</Para>

For that reason the model misses the complexity of the terrain which one reason for the disagreement.
