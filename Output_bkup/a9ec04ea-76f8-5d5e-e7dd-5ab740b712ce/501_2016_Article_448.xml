              <Para>This paper reviews the evidence for an adsorption-induced dislocation-emission (AIDE)/void-coalescence mechanism of liquid-metal embrittlement (LME), hydrogen embrittlement (HE), stress-corrosion cracking (SCC), and corrosion fatigue (CF) in some specific material-environment systems, where cleavage-like or intergranular cracking (or both) occurs in normally ductile materials. Embrittling species (which weaken substrate interatomic bonds at crack tips) include some metal atoms, hydrogen (on the crack-tip surface and at very-near-surface interstitial sites), and complex ions produced by de-alloying. Decohesion due to bond-weakening across grain boundaries associated with adsorbed or segregated hydrogen, in conjunction with segregated impurities, may also occur in some systems. The often-cited hydrogen-enhanced localised-plasticity (HELP) mechanism, based on solute hydrogen facilitating dislocation activity in the plastic zone ahead of cracks, appears to play little (if any) role in cleavage-like and intergranular cracking, and evidence supporting this view is summarised.</Para>

              <Para>In diesem Beitrag werden die Hinweise auf eine Adsorptionsinduzierte Versetzungsemission (AIDE)/Fehlstellen-Koaleszenz-Mechanismus bei der Flüssigmetall-Versprödung (LME), der Wasserstoffversprödung (HE), der Spannungsrisskorrosion (SCC) und der Korrosionsermüdung (CF) in einigen spezifischen Material-Umwelt-Systemen untersucht, in denen Quasi-Spaltbruch oder interkristalline Rissbildung bei normalerweise duktilen Werkstoffen auftreten. Zu den versprödenden Spezies, welche die interatomaren Bindungen an Rissspitzen schwächen, gehören einige Metallatome, Wasserstoff (auf der Rissspitzenoberfläche und an sehr oberflächennahen Zwischengitterplätzen) und durch Legierungsauflösung produzierte Komplexionen. Dekohäsion aufgrund von Bindungsschwächung über Korngrenzen verbunden mit adsorbiertem oder getrenntem Wasserstoff, in Verbindung mit geseigerten Verunreinigungen, kann auch in einigen Systemen auftreten. Der oft zitierte Wasserstoff-unterstützte lokalisierte Plastizitäts-Mechanismus (HELP), der darauf basiert, dass gelöster Wasserstoff in der plastischen Zone vor der Rissspitze die Versetzungsbewegung erleichtert, scheint wenig (wenn überhaupt eine) Rolle bei Quasi-Spaltbruch oder interkristalliner Rissbildung zu spielen. Argumente für diese Sicht werden zusammengefasst.</Para>

              <Para>Environmentally assisted cracking of materials, like corrosion, occurs in a wide variety of environments (including earth, water, fire, and air, as highlighted in the conference title). For stress-corrosion cracking (SCC) in aqueous and moist environments, there is often only superficial corrosion, while there is obviously no corrosion when pre-existing internal hydrogen or external hydrogen-gas environments result in hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Similarly, liquid-metal embrittlement (LME) does not involve corrosion in most cases. Failures due to SCC, HE, and LME can be catastrophic and, hence, a huge number of studies have been undertaken over the last 100 years or so in an attempt to understand the mechanisms and kinetics involved – with the aim of preventing failures and developing more-resistant materials. Somewhat surprisingly, given the vast array of experimental and theoretical tools that are now available for studying these phenomena, there are still many unresolved issues and controversies.</Para>
              <Para>One of the reasons for a lack of consensus is that there are so many possible material-environment interactions that can occur at crack tips, especially for aqueous media, e.g. film rupture/re-passivation, localised dissolution, hydrogen generation, adsorption, and diffusion, vacancy generation and diffusion, and hydrogen-vacancy-dislocation interactions. Moreover, corrosion <Emphasis Type="Italic">after</Emphasis> fracture in aqueous environments can often obscure fine details on fracture surfaces so that valuable information on the processes involved in crack growth is not available. Other reasons for a lack of consensus include: (i) there are no techniques for resolving atomic-scale crack-tip processes in bulk material, (ii) atomistic modelling techniques are not yet sufficiently developed, (iii) commercial materials with complex microstructures are often considered (owing to funding constraints) without seeking guidance from simpler systems, and (iv) some researchers either overlook or ignore evidence that does not agree with their views (and get away with it owing to inadequate refereeing of papers).</Para>
              <Para>In the present review, which draws heavily on previous recent reviews by the present author [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>], critical observations that shed light on the processes involved are highlighted (in simple systems in the first instance and then in more complex systems). LME is considered first since it is generally the least complex category of environmentally assisted cracking. Interestingly, LME was the first category of environmentally assisted cracking to be recognised—with Pliny (AD 78) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>] mentioning not only the four “classical” elements of fire, air, earth, and water, but also the effects of “quicksilver” (mercury). Thus, Pliny states that “….so penetrant is this liquor, that there is no vessel in the world but it will eat and break through it….”. Pliny’s statement is somewhat an overstatement, but it is now known that mercury can embrittle many metals, including iron, copper, zinc, aluminium, nickel, silver, titanium, and zirconium.</Para>

              <Para>The above characteristics have been observed in many single crystal and polycrystalline materials, such as LME of Ni by Hg and Na, Fe-Si by Li, steels by Hg, and Al by Bi alloys (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. Other examples are illustrated in subsequent sections where the characteristics of HE and SCC are compared with those for LME. Another consideration favouring a localised slip rather than a decohesion process is that transport of embrittling atoms to rapidly advancing crack tips has to occur by capillary flow (other processes such as surface-diffusion being too slow), and this can only occur if crack tips have a significant radius (probably at least several nanometers) – as would occur if crack growth occurred by localised plasticity but not by decohesion.</Para>

              </Para>
              <Para>The above observations can be explained on the basis that adsorption of metal atoms weakens interatomic bonds at crack tips and thereby facilitates the nucleation of dislocations [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. Dislocation nucleation at crack tips involves the simultaneous formation of a dislocation core and a surface step by shear movement of atoms within a few atomic distances of crack tips, and such shear displacements are easier when substrate interatomic bonds are weak (providing the bonds between substrate and adsorbate are not too strong). To understand why facilitating dislocation emission from crack tips results in embrittlement, it is first necessary to appreciate that dislocation emission from crack tips in inert (or air) environments is difficult owing to strong interatomic substrate bonds or strong adsorbate-substrate bonds.</Para>
              <Para>In non-embrittling environments, ductile crack growth appears to occur predominantly by egress of dislocations nucleated from sources in the plastic zone ahead of cracks. Only a small proportion of such dislocations would exactly intersect crack tips to produce crack advance – most would produce only blunting by egress just behind crack tips or would contribute to the general strain ahead of crack tips. Large strains are generated ahead of cracks resulting in the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of voids, with considerable blunting occurring at void and crack tips. Thus, large, deep dimples are observed on fracture surfaces – with small, stretched dimples often observed within the larger dimples as a result of the coalescence of large voids, nucleated at large particles, involving nucleation and growth of voids at smaller particles between them (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>). Voids can also be nucleated at slip-band intersections and other sites.</Para>

              <Para>When adsorption of metal atoms at crack tips promotes dislocation emission, a greater proportion of the dislocation activity results in crack growth because dislocation emission from crack tips on suitably inclined slip planes always produces crack advance (as well as opening). Thus, coalescence of cracks with voids in the plastic zone ahead of cracks occurs at lower strains than in inert environments, and small, shallow dimples are observed on fracture surfaces (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3</InternalRef>). The dimples resulting from the adsorption-induced dislocation-emission (AIDE) void-coalescence process also appear to be smaller than those produced by ductile fracture since, for the latter, small dimples within large dimples are often stretched and difficult to resolve.</Para>

              <Para>Crack paths produced as a result of AIDE mechanism can be intergranular or transgranular (cleavage-like) depending on where dislocation emission and void nucleation occur most easily. For transgranular cracking, alternate slip on planes on either side of the crack tends to occur in order to minimise the back-stress from previously emitted dislocations. Macroscopic fracture planes therefore bisect the angle between the slip planes, and crack fronts lie along the intersection of crack planes and slip planes, i.e. along {100} planes in &lt;110&gt; directions for FCC and BCC materials. However, deviations from these low-index planes and directions occur when unequal amounts of slip occur on either side of the crack when there are large differences in shear stresses on the respective planes.</Para>

                <Heading>Similarities between HE and Adsorption-Induced LME</Heading>
                <Para>For materials and/or conditions where hydrides do not form, there have been long-standing controversies regarding whether HE is due to adsorbed hydrogen at crack tips or solute hydrogen localised ahead of crack tips. This controversy applies to both internal HE (where pre-existing solute hydrogen can diffuse to and adsorb at internal cracks) and to hydrogen-environment embrittlement (in gaseous H<Subscript>2</Subscript> or H<Subscript>2</Subscript>S) where hydrogen can adsorb and then diffuse ahead of cracks in most cases. Similarities between HE and adsorption-induced LME are one of <Emphasis Type="Italic">many</Emphasis> considerations that suggest that the AIDE mechanism is predominantly responsible for cleavage-like and intergranular HE, with solute hydrogen playing little, if any, role [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>For HE, weakening of interatomic bonds at crack tips could be due to hydrogen adsorbed at surface sites and hydrogen in interstitial sites in the first few atomic layers beneath the crack-tip surface. For convenience, hydrogen at both these sites is referred to as adsorbed hydrogen [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. In addition, hydrogen could diffuse to (or be transported by dislocations) to voids ahead of cracks, where it could precipitate as hydrogen gas in voids and adsorb at void tips, especially in BCC materials with high hydrogen diffusivities. The AIDE process for HE could therefore occur at both crack and void tips.</Para>
                <Para>Some proponents of solute-hydrogen based mechanisms have recently dismissed the similarities between HE and LME as being indicative of a common mechanism on the basis that similar fracture-surface appearances are not necessarily produced by the same underlying process [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. This may well be sometimes the case, e.g. when intergranular fracture surfaces are ‘featureless’ except for occasional tear ridges and slip lines, where decohesion in some cases, or very localised slip processes in other cases, could be involved. However, the case for a common mechanism of HE and LME is especially convincing when the fracture paths, the extent of plasticity, and the richly detailed, fine-scale fracture-surface appearance are all the same (as in the examples shown in the following), <Emphasis Type="Italic">particularly when considered in conjunction with other evidence that adsorbed hydrogen rather than solute hydrogen is responsible for cleavage-like and intergranular fractures, as discussed in subsequent sections</Emphasis>.</Para>

                <Heading>Experimental Evidence that Adsorbed Hydrogen Can Produce HE</Heading>
                <Para>Both adsorbed and solute hydrogen are present for most testing conditions, but there are circumstances where only adsorbed hydrogen is present and HE occurs. For example, studies of fatigue cracking (along intergranular and transgranular paths) in Ni polycrystals in hydrogen gas [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>] have shown that crack-growth rates are increased (by up to 50 × compared with crack-growth rates in nitrogen) at low temperatures (down to − 196°C) where hydrogen-diffusion rates, D, are so slow (D ~ 10<Superscript>− 29</Superscript> cm<Superscript>2</Superscript>/s at − 196°C [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]) that hydrogen would not diffuse ahead of cracks (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig15">15</InternalRef>).</Para>
                <Para>In another study, tensile tests on notched Ni single crystals in gaseous hydrogen produced cleavage-like fractures at − 130°C (D ~ 10<Superscript>− 17</Superscript> cm<Superscript>2</Superscript>/s) where hydrogen diffusion ahead of cracks would be unlikely to occur even at the slow strain rates used [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. At 20°C (D ~ 10<Superscript>− 14</Superscript> cm<Superscript>2</Superscript>/s), cleavage-like cracking of fatigue pre-cracked Ni single crystals in gaseous hydrogen has been observed at crack velocities ~ 0.2 mm/s at very high crack-opening-displacement rates, such that there would no time for diffusion of hydrogen more than several atomic distances ahead of cracks [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>An embrittlement site very close to crack tips is also supported by the abrupt transitions in fracture-surface appearance produced on changing environmental conditions, e.g. changing from hydrogen to oxygen or argon gas (and vice versa) (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig16">16</InternalRef>), or adding oxygen to hydrogen-gas environments [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. Similarly, detailed analyses of the effects of hydrogen-gas pressure and temperature on crack-growth kinetics in Fe-Si and Ni single crystals [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>] indicate that embrittlement occurs within ~ 5 nm of crack tips rather than in the general plastic zone – which is also consistent with an adsorbed hydrogen mechanism.</Para>

                <Para>There is no doubt that hydrogen atmospheres around dislocations, and hydrogen at dislocation cores, can affect their movement.

                        <Para>For hydrogen-charged polycrystals, the preference for intergranular cracking in many materials is difficult to understand on the basis of solute-hydrogen:dislocation interactions because such interactions would not be expected to occur preferentially in regions adjacent to grain boundaries ahead of cracks vis-à-vis regions ahead of transgranular cracks. However, monolayer segregation of hydrogen would be expected at grain boundaries, such that intergranular crack-tip bonding would be weakened thereby facilitating dislocation emission or decohesion. Bonding at grain boundaries may also be weakened by other segregants, e.g. metalloid impurities in steels, in conjunction with hydrogen. Hydrogen probably also adsorbs at intergranular crack tips from gaseous hydrogen within internal grain-boundary cracks, with hydrogen diffusing or transported by dislocations to such cracks during testing.</Para>

                <Para>The evidence for an adsorption-based mechanism of HE (when hydrides do not form) is compelling and, in most cases, the metallographic and fractographic observations (when sufficiently high-resolution techniques are used) suggest that cleavage-like and intergranular cracking occur by a localised-plasticity/void-coalescence process. Taken together, the above strongly supports the adsorption-induced dislocation-emission (AIDE)/void-coalescence HE hypothesis for most cleavage-like and intergranular fractures. However, there may well be some instances of intergranular cracking where decohesion along grain boundaries predominates. There is no evidence that solute-hydrogen:dislocation interactions are significant for cleavage-like or intergranular fractures, but they could be important for slip-band cracking, e.g. in Ni superalloys, owing to solute hydrogen promoting slip planarity [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>].</Para>

              <Heading>Hydrogen Assisted Stress Corrosion Cracking</Heading>
              <Para>For SCC (and CF) of many materials in aqueous environments, hydrogen is generated at crack tips by dissociation of water molecules or electrochemical reactions, and it is widely accepted that hydrogen somehow facilitates crack growth. Not surprisingly, there are the same controversies regarding the exact mechanism(s), as discussed for HE in the previous section. Additionally, the roles of dissolution, film formation, and other processes need to be considered for cracking in aqueous environments as mentioned in the introduction. Notwithstanding the complexities, there is compelling evidence that the AIDE/void-coalescence mechanism discussed for HE is also applicable to SCC/CF in some cases (but certainly not all) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>], as summarised for some specific materials and environments in the following.</Para>

                <Para>All the above observations are consistent with an AIDE/void-coalescence mechanism since, for example, there would be no time for other reactions such as hydrogen diffusion ahead of cracks at high crack velocities and, as for HE, evidence that solute hydrogen ahead of cracks (which could be present at low crack velocities) is not embrittling. There is also widespread agreement that localised dissolution cannot account for cleavage-like cracking [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>For intergranular SCC, fracture surfaces are characterised by brittle facets exhibiting grain-boundary precipitates and, in some cases, crack-arrest markings (CAMs) (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig24">24</InternalRef>), although such features may sometimes be obscured by corrosion products. The presence of CAMs (and other evidence that crack growth involves rapid crack jumps and periods of crack-arrest) suggests that hydrogen generated at crack tips may diffuse ahead of cracks and segregate at grain boundaries during crack-arrest periods so that bonding across boundaries is weakened. Crack-growth increments could then occur by decohesion or localised slip when a critical hydrogen concentration over a critical distance is achieved [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Para>SCC of Ti alloys in aqueous environments, like Mg alloys, produces low-energy cleavage-like and fluted fractures – with the former occurring not only on basal planes but also on planes 12–15° away from basal planes, with no evidence of hydride phases associated with such fractures [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Essentially identical fracture-surface appearances and crystallography are produced by adsorption-induced LME (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig28">28</InternalRef>) which, along with other observations, support an adsorbed-hydrogen based mechanism for some of the reasons discussed for Al alloys and in other sections [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Para>For high-strength martensitic steels, I-SCC along prior-austenite grain boundaries is much more common than T-SCC, but cleavage-like cracking does occur to some extent, depending on steel purity and other variables (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig29">29</InternalRef>). For low strength steels, such as those used in pipelines, the crack path depends on the local environment (especially pH), with I-SCC predominating for high pH conditions in concentrated carbonate/bi-carbonate solutions and T-SCC occurring for low or near neutral pH solutions. I-SCC in high-strength steels is usually attributed to an effect of hydrogen (probably HEDE with contributions from AIDE), while I-SCC in low-strength steels is usually attributed to localised dissolution. For cleavage-like cracking, the AIDE mechanism probably predominates, as discussed previously for other systems exhibiting cleavage-like cracking. Such hypotheses are reasonable based on the observations for the model systems, and comparisons of SCC with HEE, IHE and LME [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Para>SCC of FCC alloys, such as Cu-Zn, Cu-Au, and Ag-Au alloys is associated with de-alloying at crack-tips, and there is a strong correlation between increasing rates of SCC and increasing rates of de-alloying as the concentration of the less-noble alloying element increases [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]. De-alloying (selective corrosion) results in a nano-porous film that is macroscopically brittle, but fractures by localised shear of nano-scale ligaments. Critical observations include:</Para>

If specimens are not tested immediately, then ductile behaviour is observed [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>].</Para>

                </Para>
                <Para>The above observations are best explained [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>] on the basis that de-alloying produces a concentrated ionic solution within the nano-porous film and that, when the film fractures, adsorption of specific ions on the unfilmed substrate results in AIDE or decohesion until the supply of embrittling liquid is exhausted. Crack-arrest then occurs (under sustained loading) or a transition to ductile fracture occurs (under dynamic loading). Ductile fracture occurs if there is a delay time before testing under dynamic loading probably because the concentrated ionic liquid becomes diluted by mixing with less concentrated liquid further from the crack tip such that it is no longer embrittling.</Para>
                <Para>Comparisons of SCC with LME support the above hypothesis for I-SCC since brittle intergranular fractures are observed in both cases. Cleavage-like LME fractures of Cu alloys have not been observed (even in single crystals) in any of the liquid-metal environments used, but cleavage-like cracking has been occasionally observed on {110} planes in Al alloys (although {100} planes are much more common). Alternative explanations for SCC in de-alloying systems, such as ‘film-induced cleavage’ [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>], can be discounted on various grounds, as discussed in detail elsewhere [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>].</Para>
