            <Para ID="Par2" TextBreak="No">In order to become an effective leader, one must understand the core leadership theories and the styles that emerged from them, how they evolved, and how to implement different styles of leadership depending on the environment, situation, or need of the leader. Physicians, and more specifically surgeons, are natural leaders as they are used to quick decision-making and tend to be authoritative. However, due to the nature of the work of a surgeon, this can also breed leaders with autocratic leadership styles, a style not conducive to the success of a current day surgical department. Over time, as generational changes have occurred, the traditional autocratic leadership style, so natural of surgeons from the Silent Generation, no longer resonates well with today’s Generation X and Generation Y surgery faculty and trainees. In addition to understanding the needs of the organization, it is important to understand the needs of the personnel being lead. Below, the core leadership theories are discussed, followed by a description of some of the common leadership styles. Lastly, a discussion of leadership in surgery with respect to these different leadership styles is presented.</Para>

              <Heading>Trait Theories</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par3" TextBreak="No">Trait theories argue that effective leaders share common personality traits or characteristics. These include traits and qualities such as integrity, honesty, assertiveness, decisiveness, motivation, innovation, vision, intelligence, persuasiveness, etc. Early trait theories posed that leadership traits are innate and that one is born to be a leader. Trait theories have now evolved and pose that one can learn leadership traits, and that positive leadership traits can be developed through training and education. Many studies on leadership traits have been conducted in an attempt to identify traits of successful leaders. The Forbes top 10 qualities that make a great leader include: honesty, creativity, intuition, confidence, commitment, ability to inspire, delegate, and communicate, a sense of humor, and positive attitude [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. While many of the above traits are associated with great leaders, it should be noted that the converse does not necessarily hold true, i.e. that having these traits or a combination of these traits guarantees that one will be a successful leader.

              <Heading>Behavioral Theories</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par4" TextBreak="No">Behavioral theories focus on how a leader behaves. In the early 1930s, Kurt Lewin presented a framework based on the behaviors of leaders [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. He described three types of leadership behaviors: (1) autocratic; (2) democratic; and (3) laissez-faire. Autocratic leaders are described as making decisions without consulting their teams. This type of leadership is appropriate when quick decisions need to be made, when there is no need for agreement, or when agreement from the team is not necessary in order for a successful outcome to be achieved. Democratic leaders take into consideration input from the team before making a decision. The degree of input considered will vary from leader to leader. This type of leadership is appropriate when team agreement is important for the final outcome. However, this style of leadership can be difficult to manage when a wide variety of opinions, perspectives, and ideas exist among the team members. Laissez-faire leaders typically do not interfere with the decision-making process. These leaders allow the individuals in the team to make most of the decisions. This type of leadership is appropriate when the teams consist of highly competent, skilled, motivated and capable individuals that require little supervision. This leadership style can fail when it is born out of laziness on the part of the leader. Since the description of these three leadership styles, many more styles have emerged. A description of the most common leadership styles follows below.</Para>

              <Heading>Contingency or Situational Theories</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par5" TextBreak="No">Contingency or situational leadership theories pose that no one leadership style is the correct style. Instead, the best leadership style is the one dictated by the situation or circumstance (i.e., situational leadership). For example, if a quick decision is required, the autocratic leadership style might be best. If the full support of all team members is required, the democratic leadership style might be best. Contingent leadership theories also pose that the best leadership style depends on characteristics of the team members. For instance, the Hersey-Blanchard Situational Leadership Theory proposes that successful leaders should change their leadership styles based on the maturity of the people on the team and the details of the task [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Hersey and Blanchard describe four leadership styles for this theory (i.e., telling, selling, participating, and delegating) and four maturity levels. The use of each style is dictated by the maturity level of the team members. If the team members have a low maturity, the telling style works best. If the team members have high maturity, the delegating style works best. The Dunham and Pierce Leadership Process Model describes how four factors contribute to leadership success or failure [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. These factors are: the leader, the followers, the context, and the outcome. All four variables are related to each other and affect each other. This model highlights that leadership is dynamic and that it is important to be flexible based on the context, the outcome, and the team.</Para>

              <Heading>Power and Influence Theories</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par6" TextBreak="No">Power and influence theories are based on the different ways in which leaders use their power and influence to get things done. These theories then examine the leadership styles that emerge as a result. For example, people tend to follow others who are powerful. When others follow that person, the person with power leads. But, there are different reasons why people have power. One of the best-known theories that describes this type of leadership is French and Raven’s Five Forms of Power [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. John French and Bertram Raven described five forms of power: legitimate, reward, expert, referent, and coercive. Legitimate power comes from the belief that that person has the right to make demands and expect compliance, such as a CEO or president. Reward power is when someone has the power to compensate others for their actions (i.e., salary increase, bonus, etc.). Expert power comes from a person’s own superior skill or knowledge (i.e., recognized expertise). Referent power results from a person’s perceived worthiness, charm, charisma, or appeal, such as celebrities. Coercive power results when someone has the ability to punish others. When a person recognizes their source of power they are better able to lead for the best outcome. The positional power sources (i.e., legitimate, reward, and coercive) tend to be the least effective as they can easily fail, while the personal power sources (i.e., expert and referent) tend to be the most effective.</Para>

              <Heading>Emotional Intelligence</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par7" TextBreak="No">Emotional intelligence is having the ability to understand and manage your emotions as well as those of the people around you (direct reports, peers, and supervisors). Leaders with emotional intelligence tend to be calm, don’t lose their temper, and don’t get out of control, no matter what the situation or crisis is about. Leaders with emotional intelligence are able to recognize what they are feeling, what these emotions mean, how these emotions can impact others, and are able to modulate their leadership style based on this information. Having emotional intelligence is essential for a leader. First popularized by Daniel Goleman, five elements of emotional intelligence have been described: (1) self-awareness; (2) self-regulation; (3) motivation; (4) empathy; and (5) social skills [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. The more a leader is able to understand how their emotions and actions impact others and is able to manage each of these five elements, the higher the emotional intelligence. The higher the emotional intelligence, the more successful he or she will be as a leader, as they will be able to relate to and work with others better. To learn more about emotional intelligence and these five elements, the reader is directed to Chap. <ExternalRef>

            <Heading>Leadership Styles</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par8" TextBreak="No">Many different leadership styles have been born from the core leadership theories described above. A brief description of some of the more common leadership styles is provided.</Para>
            <FormalPara ID="FPar6" RenderingStyle="Style1">
              <Heading>Autocratic Leadership</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par9" TextBreak="No">As described above, autocratic leadership is when the leader makes decisions without consulting their team. Autocratic leaders tend to have a lot of power over the people they lead. A benefit of this type of leadership is that it is very efficient. Thus, it is appropriate leadership when quick decisions need to be made, when there is no need for agreement, or when agreement from the team is not necessary in order for a successful outcome to be achieved. This type of leadership works well in situations of crisis where quick decisions must be made and followed. It works well for the military as it allows the troops to focus their attention and energy on performing the task at hand. It also works well for jobs that require routine tasks or involve unskilled labor. A disadvantage to this type of leadership is that most people resent being treated this way. It can result in high levels of job dissatisfaction and turnover. Autocratic leadership is an extreme form of transactional leadership, which is discussed below.</Para>
            </FormalPara>
            <FormalPara ID="FPar7" RenderingStyle="Style1">
              <Heading>Democratic or Participative Leadership</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par10" TextBreak="No">Democratic leaders include the team members in the decision-making process but make the final decisions themselves. Democratic leaders encourage creativity, participation, and input from the team members. As a result, team members feel a greater sense of purpose toward the common mission and tend to be very engaged in the project, work and/or decision, and hence productive. Benefits of democratic leadership are many and include high job satisfaction among the team members and greater motivation of the workers since they feel a sense of inclusion and empowerment with the decision-making process. This type of leadership also tends to result in greater development of the skills of the team members, supporting even more engagement. This leadership style is most suitable for situations in which working as a team is necessary, and when quality is more important than productivity or efficiency. However, a distinct disadvantage of this type of leadership is that it takes time, especially compared to autocratic leadership. Thus, it can hinder speed and efficiency and would not be good during times of crisis. Lastly, this type of leadership only works well when the team members have the knowledge and/or expertise to contribute meaningfully to the decision-making process.</Para>

              <Heading>Bureaucratic Leadership</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par11" TextBreak="No">Bureaucratic leaders are rule followers and work “by the book”. They ensure that everyone follows the rules and procedures rigorously and precisely. Advantages of this leadership style are precision, efficiency, and predictable output. This style of leadership functions well for tasks that require a high degree of accuracy and safety, such as operating heavy machinery, working with caustic or explosive chemicals, or at extreme heights. It works well for jobs that handle large amounts of currency, such as cashiers, currency exchange personnel, and bankers. It is also ideal for activities that are very routine, such as manufacturing. Disadvantages of this leadership style are that creativity and innovation are stifled because of the rigid, inflexible framework. It can also create resentment among the team members if the leader obtains the position because of conformity and rule following and not because of qualifications or recognized expertise.</Para>

              <Heading>Charismatic Leadership</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par12" TextBreak="No">Charismatic leaders lead by inspiring enthusiasm in their team members. They are energetic leaders, motivating others to excel. The ability to create excitement and commitment among the team members has great benefit. In a way, this type of leadership can resemble transformational leadership which is discussed below. However, the main distinction between charismatic leadership and transformational leadership lies with the intent of the leader. Transformational leaders want to inspire change in their team members or organization. Charismatic leaders are often focused on themselves and do not necessarily want to lead change. An obvious disadvantage with this leadership style lies with the leader, as they are more interested in themselves than their team members or organization. Charismatic leaders also have a sense that they can do no wrong, even when others may point out to them the error of their ways. Due to their heightened sense of self-worth, charismatic leaders are often viewed as successful by their team members. Thus, from an organizational point of view, if a charismatic leader departs there is a great risk that the project, team, or organization will collapse given the inherent focus on the leader and not the team or organization.</Para>

              <Heading>Laissez-Faire Leadership</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par13" TextBreak="No">As discussed above, laissez-faire leaders, also known as passive-avoidant leaders, typically do not interfere with the decision-making process. These leaders allow the individuals in the team to make most of the decisions. These leaders typically allow the team members complete freedom to do their work when and how they like, and to set their deadlines. This type of leadership works best when the teams consist of highly competent, skilled, motivated, and capable individuals who require very little supervision. This leadership style also works well when the leaders monitor performance and provide regular feedback. One of the main advantages of this leadership style is that team members tend to have very high job satisfaction and productivity given the autonomy they are permitted. A disadvantage of this type of leadership style is when it emerges out of laziness on the part of the leader. In addition, this type of leadership style fails if the team members are not internally motivated, or don’t have the skill or knowledge to do their jobs.</Para>

              <Heading>People-Oriented or Relations-Oriented Leadership</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par14" TextBreak="No">People- or relations-oriented leaders are completely focused on developing, organizing, and supporting the people on the team. This leadership style requires participation and teamwork, and tends to support creativity and collaborations. People-oriented leaders tend to treat everyone on the team equally. They are usually very approachable and friendly leaders, and pay close attention to the welfare of all the team members. These leaders are also readily available in times of need by any team member. An advantage of this style of leadership is that people like to be on teams with people-oriented leaders. Team members led in this way tend to be productive and are more willing to take risks because they know the leader will support them if they need it. This leadership style tends to be the opposite of task-oriented leadership which is discussed below. A disadvantage of this leadership style is when the leader goes too far and prioritizes the development of the team above the task, project, or organization.</Para>

              <Heading>Task-Oriented Leadership</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par15" TextBreak="No">Task-oriented leaders focus on getting the task or job done. These leaders share some traits with autocratic and bureaucratic leaders. Task-oriented leaders define the work to be done, the roles required of the team members, put structure in place to complete the task, plan and organize how the work will get done, and monitor the output. These leaders are excellent at creating and maintaining performance standards. An advantage of this style of leadership is that the task will be completed in a timely manner. This style is also helpful for team members who need lots of direction and do not manage their time well. Disadvantages of this leadership style are low job satisfaction and morale which can lead to high turnover with low retention rates among team members.</Para>

              <Heading>Servant Leadership</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par16" TextBreak="No">A servant leader is someone who leads by simply meeting the needs of the team at large. They often don’t recognize themselves as the leader and serve in this capacity more out of duty and by leading through example. Servant leaders tend to stay away from the limelight and glory of leading. They prefer to get the work done and have the team receive the recognition, not themselves as leaders. Given these characteristics, these leaders tend to have very high integrity and generosity. Servant leadership is a form of democratic leadership since the entire team is involved in the decision-making process. This type of leadership is useful for tasks or projects that place emphasis on values. In fact, servant leaders tend to move up the ladder based on their values. Under the power and influence theory, this would be most similar to expert power, as servant leaders gain power because of their values, ideals, and ethics in addition to knowledge, skills and expertise. Servant leadership also tends to create a positive team and corporate attitude with high morale. A disadvantage of servant leadership is the time required to master this type of leadership, and the time required to complete tasks and projects. Similar to democratic leadership, it can take a lot of time for the team members to make decisions. Thus, this leadership style is less conducive for situations that require quick decisions or have tight deadlines. Another disadvantage of this leadership style relates to competitive leadership positions. Servant leaders tend to trail behind leaders using other styles in competitive situations.</Para>

              <Heading>Transactional Leadership</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par17" TextBreak="No">Transactional leadership implies that a worker or team member is paid or compensated in some manner for their work product or services (i.e., a transaction). If the work is not done, the leader has the right to be punitive. Thus, team members are motivated by reward and punishment, and transactional leadership can be described as having two components: (1) contingent reward and (2) management by exception. This style of leadership is similar to having coercive power as the source of power described from the power and influence theories. An advantage of this type of leadership is that everyone’s roles and responsibilities are clearly delineated. In addition, people who are ambitious tend to excel with this type of leadership since performance by individual team members is evaluated and considered and not that of the team. A disadvantage of this leadership style is the potential for low job satisfaction. Team members can do little to change their job situation which can lead to high employee turnover. This type of leadership is typical of managerial positions. It is not conducive to situations that require creativity and innovation. Some would argue that this is not a leadership style at all, as the focus is on completion of task. However, others argue that this leadership style is similar to task-oriented leadership.</Para>

              <Heading>Transformational Leadership</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par18" TextBreak="No">Transformational leaders inspire workers and team members with a shared vision of the future. It is a vision that is usually ambitious yet rich, exciting, and attainable. Transformational leaders set clear goals, inspire people to work toward those goals, and manage delivery of the vision. These leaders also coach and develop the team members by recognizing the potential of their team members and engaging them intellectually to achieve their full potential. They provide regular feedback and serve as good mentors. Transformational leaders also tend to have very high integrity and outstanding communication skills. Given all of these attributes, transformational leadership has been described as having four components: (1) idealized influence; (2) inspirational motivation; (3) intellectual stimulation; and (4) individualized consideration. Currently, this is one of the most successful types of leadership in the business world. An advantage of this type of leadership is that because these leaders tend to expect the very best of the team members, team members are highly satisfied, productive, and engaged. Thus, job turnover is lower compared to other types of leadership. A disadvantage of this type of leadership is inherently linked to the enthusiasm of the leader – they tend to need support from the detail people. This is why one often observes transformational leaders being supported by transactional leaders (i.e., the managers), with the latter being the individuals who will get the work done.</Para>

              <Heading>Adaptive Leadership</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par19" TextBreak="No">Adaptive leaders employ several of the leadership styles described above. The role of an adaptive leader is to guide the team members through problem solving, rather than solving the problem themselves. Adaptive leaders engage the team members, empower and motivate them to solve the adaptive problem on their own. This process requires thoughtful direction on the part of the leader. An advantage of this style of leadership is that change is more likely to be sustainable than if it were decreed from an autocratic leadership style. The latter type of change is usually transient. This type of leadership style is good for organizations in need of culture change. A disadvantage of this style of leadership is that it can take time for the team members to solve the problem. This leadership style also requires that the team members have some knowledge, skill, and expertise with the problem being addressed. This strategy can be helpful in the health care industry when physicians are leading physicians and the desire is a sustainable culture change.</Para>

            <Heading>Leadership in Surgery</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par20" TextBreak="No">No one leadership style is right for everyone. Surgeons by nature, and due to our training paradigm, tend to exhibit autocratic, task-oriented, and transactional leadership styles. However, there are times when democratic, bureaucratic, servant, and definitely transformational leadership is required. Due to this, some would argue that situational leadership is the best theory, as it takes into account the needs of the team members, the organization, and tasks in determining the best leadership style that fits those needs. For example, in the operating room, a democratic team approach is needed between the anesthetists, nursing staff, and surgeons. However, in times of crisis, an autocratic style clearly works best. Similarly, in the clinics, a collaborative democratic approach is required between the scheduling clerks, nurses, and physicians. But, when it comes to managing a specific ailment, disease, or complications, the physician will need to take charge and be decisive. For a Chair of a Department of Surgery, depending on the needs of the institution and the need for change management, a transformational leadership style may work best. When consensus is needed, a democratic approach is helpful. Yet, surgeons also still require some form of transactional leadership in the sense of reward and punishment. The later especially applies to matters of compensation.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par21" TextBreak="No">Many studies have been conducted examining leadership styles in the health care industry. Xirasagar et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>] surveyed executive directors of community health care centers using a Likert-type scale. They found that transformational leadership was used most often. The executives found it most effective and felt that it resulted in the greatest subordinate satisfaction and effort. Transactional leadership closely followed transformational leadership, and laissez-faire leadership trailed a distant third. An examination of rural primary care physicians by Hana and Kirkhaug revealed that physicians used change style leadership (i.e., transformational) the most, followed by task style (i.e., task-oriented), and then relation style [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. Interestingly, lead physicians were noted to use mostly change style, whereas age was negatively correlated with the use of change and relation style. A survey of physician medical and executive directors of health care systems also revealed the highest scores for transformational leadership as compared to transactional and laissez-faire [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. A similar survey of deans of nursing programs showed that 77 % of the deans scored highest with transformational leadership, 21 % for transactional leadership, and 2 % for passive-avoidant leadership [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. Thus, it is clear that a good leader should be well-versed in the different styles of leadership and use them appropriately, as dictated by the need.</Para>

            <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
            <Para ID="Par22" TextBreak="No">Several different leadership core theories exist. These theories have evolved over time but take into account leadership traits, leadership behavior, the situation (i.e., contingency theory), the source of power and influence, and emotional intelligence. From these, many leadership styles have emerged to describe how leaders function to achieve a successful outcome. These styles include autocratic, democratic, bureaucratic, charismatic, laissez-faire, people or relations-oriented, task-oriented, servant, transactional, transformational, and adaptive leadership. No one leadership style is right for one person or one situation. However, studies on leadership in the health care arena reveal that the most effective leaders have adopted a significant portion of their leadership style as transformational, a style very popular in the business world. Varying contributions of other styles also comprise a good leader’s armamentarium and it is important to understand when one style is better over another. Surgeons are uniquely positioned to be leaders. However, it is imperative that surgeons recognize that their training paradigm has a tendency to produce an autocratic leadership style, a style rarely effective in the health care industry. Through education and training about the various leadership theories and styles, a surgeon can be well-positioned to lead.</Para>
