            <Para ID="Par1">Primary cilia are nonmotile, solitary organelles that protrude from the apical surface of nearly every mammalian cell. Discovered over a century ago, the primary cilium has been identified as a multifunctional antenna, sensing both mechanical (fluid flow, pressure, touch, vibration) and chemical changes in the extracellular environment. Furthermore, the primary cilium has also been implicated as a complex signaling center for the cell, regulating key signaling pathways during development such as Hedgehog and Wnt. In this article we summarize recent theoretical approaches for modeling primary cilium bending mechanics. By combining theoretical modeling and detailed experimental observations, we construct a model for the primary cilium as an elastic slender beam with a nonlinear rotational stiffness at the base that accounts for the behavior of the basal anchorage. The importance of incorporating the detailed basal anchorage in multiscale modeling of the primary cilium is highlighted by good quantitative agreement between cilium bending under flow and experimental observation. New observations further illustrate how the microtubule network connected to the basal body responds to mechanical stress from the bending of the primary cilium. We discuss how to use the current model as a foundation to construct a more realistic multiscale model that incorporates coupling with the cytoplasmic microtubule network.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par2">The primary cilium is a solitary nonmotile, microtubule-based organelle found ubiquitously in many nonmitotic mammalian cells [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. As a hair-like protrusion from the apical cell membrane into the extracellular space (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">5.1</InternalRef>), the core structure of the primary cilium is a membrane-enclosed axoneme containing nine microtubule doublets that originate from the basal body. The ciliary membrane is a continuation of the plasma membrane [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>], and experimental findings suggest that there are physiological differences between the two, such as lipid compositions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>], electrical resistance [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>], ion-binding, and osmotic behavior [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. The axonemal base is connected to the cilium basal body, a protein-based structure consisting of nine triplet microtubules arranged circumferentially.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

            <Para ID="Par3">When cells are not involved in mitosis, the centrioles (the central component of the microtubule organizing center) migrate to the cell membrane and one (the mother centriole) acts as a template for ciliogenesis and the anchoring basal body for the ciliary axoneme [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. The basal body includes structures such as the distal and subdistal appendages. The distal appendages attach it to the cell membrane. Below this, it is coupled to the cytoskeletal microtubule network at the subdistal appendages also known as the basal feet [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>], which extend laterally to form attachment points for cytoskeletal microtubules. Extending into the cytoplasm are striated rootlets, a collection of filamentous structures with periodic striations that radiate from the proximal end of the basal body. It has been suggested that these rootlets act as “nanomachines” for muscle-like contraction [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>], highways for the transport of proteins from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>], or anchorage for the basal body/primary cilium complex by interacting with the cell’s cytoskeleton [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par4">Between the axoneme and the basal body is a transition zone (TZ) (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">5.1</InternalRef>) where the transition fibers (right below the Y-links, also called the ciliary necklace [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]), link the TZ microtubules with the ciliary membrane. These connectors distribute around the TZ microtubules in an almost symmetrical fashion. The transition zone is also closely associated with various proteins and molecular transport around the ciliary pocket [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par5">Primary cilia differ from the better-understood motile cilia in several important aspects. Despite similarities in the axonemal structure which consists of nine microtubule doublets, there are significant differences: motile cilia and flagella have two additional central microtubules, which are attached to each of the surrounding doublets by radial spokes. Therefore, motile cilia are commonly referred to as <InlineEquation ID="IEq1">

Unlike motile cilia, there is only a single primary cilium per cell. Motile cilia are expressed only on specialized cells, while primary cilia are found in virtually every cell type. Furthermore, primary cilia have multiple basal feet and striated rootlets distributed evenly around their basal bodies, while the basal feet of beating cilia are aligned with the beating direction [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par6">Although initial morphological descriptions of primary cilia date back over a century, their function has only recently begun to be unraveled. Initially the focus had been on the role of primary cilia in cellular development where they are known to be involved in establishment of the left–right axis and anterior–posterior limb bud patterning [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>] via sensing of the Hedgehog and Wnt families of morphogens. As a sensory organelle, the primary cilium enables the cell to interrogate its environment over a distance and has emerged as a central site of cell signal coordination and integration.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par7">More recently, the mechanosensing role of primary cilia was discovered. Praetorious and Spring found a dramatic extracellular calcium-dependent increase in intracellular calcium by using fluid flow or a micropipette to bend the primary cilia of kidney epithelial cells. They also found that this response was lost with removal of primary cilia [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>]. It has been suggested that this response occurs via a cationic channel that localizes to the base of the cilium known as polycystin 2 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>]. This mechanism has also been found in liver cholangiocytes in response to fluid flow [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>]. In addition to calcium signaling, fluid flow in bile ducts also activates the second messenger cAMP [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>]. The response of the primary cilium to the external load is observed to be more than mechanical bending and transfer of stress, but also molecular alterations. For example, proteins of the linker density may undergo conformational changes as a result of Ca<InlineEquation ID="IEq4">

            <Para ID="Par8">Defective or malfunctional primary cilia have been linked to pathologies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>] such as arthritis, osteoporosis, polycystic kidney disease, heart failure, obesity, and cancer. For example, it is well known that when bone is exposed to repeated mechanical loading in vivo it loses its sensitivity to subsequent mechanical loading [<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR39">39</CitationRef>]. This reduced sensitivity is refractory and is gradually reversed over a period of minutes. Furthermore, it coincides with a loss of cellular responsiveness [<CitationRef CitationID="CR40">40</CitationRef>]. Interestingly, there is also evidence that primary cilia degrade with loading [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par9">Recent state-of-the-art measurements have uncovered detailed equilibrium shape and dynamics of the ciliary axoneme under flow. These experimental results are summarized in Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec2">5.2</InternalRef>, where we also explain that multiscale modeling is the key to advancement in modeling of primary cilia. We refined a drag-force/cantilevered-beam model to incorporate large rotation at the ciliary base (Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec4">5.3.1</InternalRef>). We have recently further extended our model and used slender-body theory to consistently address the fluid–structure interaction between the the fluid and ciliary axoneme with nonlinear rotational stiffness of the basal body (Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec5">5.3.2</InternalRef>). Our modeling results and quantitative comparisons with experiments indicate that the mechanical details of the basal anchorage are essential to capturing the mechanical characteristics and understanding the behaviors of the primary cilium. In Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec11">5.5</InternalRef> we summarize recent findings on the morphological changes in the microtubule network connected to the basal body. In Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec12">5.6</InternalRef> we discuss the challenges in multiscale modeling of primary cilia that incorporate the mechanical coupling between the axoneme and the underlying microtubule network.</Para>

            <Para ID="Par10">Models of the primary cilium should incorporate the bending (characterized by axonemal length and bending rigidity) and positional characteristics (characterized by axonemal orientation at the base and its position on the cell) observed for different cells. The axonemal length is a dynamic quantity that depends on regulated intraflagellar transport (IFT) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR42">42</CitationRef>]. It is not clear if there exists an optimal length for mechanotransduction, nor is it understood if this length may vary over different cell types. The three-dimensional axonemal orientation varies by cell type, and it has been reported that a well-defined axonemal orientation can be observed for a population of cells [<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef>]. The axonemal position has been found to be critical for establishing tissue organization in highly anisotropic tissues [<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par11">The complex sub-axonemal compartment is often simplified in models for motile cilia and beating flagella. As a paradigm for studying biological swimming and propulsion in biophysics and applied mathematics, motile cilia and flagella are examples where, once the biomechanics of an organelle is properly formulated in mathematical terms, advancements in multiscale modeling and direct numerical simulations lead to quantitative understanding of biological functions that may be beyond reach of experiments alone. These advances have also stimulated a series of experiments focusing not just on more detailed investigations of motile cilia, but also synthesis of artificial beating cilia that are designed to perform the biological function of moving mucus [<CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR45">45</CitationRef>]. Following Lighthill’s early work [<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">46</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR47">47</CitationRef>] Gueron et al. adopted similar approaches to investigate the fluid flow induced by a beating cilium/flagellum [<CitationRef CitationID="CR48">48</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>]. Slender-body theory has been widely used to investigate the interaction between the beating cilium/flagellum and the viscous fluid.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par12">Multiscale modeling of a motile cilium that incorporates the beating kinematics in the immersed boundary framework [<CitationRef CitationID="CR51">51</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR56">56</CitationRef>] has shed light on the bio-fluid mechanics of beating cilia and flagellated swimmers in viscous fluid [<CitationRef CitationID="CR55">55</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR56">56</CitationRef>]. The internal structures of a beating cilium such as the elasticity of the microtubule doublets and connectivity between the doublets are incorporated into these models [<CitationRef CitationID="CR51">51</CitationRef>]. Multiple beating cilia interact with each other nonlocally through hydrodynamic interactions, as each one of them beats according to its own internal stress generated by the central microtubule doublet. In all of these studies the role of the basal body and the coupling to the cytoskeleton membrane have been ignored. However, recent studies have shown the importance of the basal body anchorage in swimming by flagellum undulation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR57">57</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par13">Compared to motile cilia and flagella, much less theoretical modeling and numerical simulations of primary cilia have been reported. Schwartz et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR58">58</CitationRef>] developed a mathematical model based on a small-deformation elastic beam formulation. This model assumed a constant velocity and drag profile along the cilium, not valid under high flow conditions. Resnick et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR59">59</CitationRef>] applied a similar formulation to study small deflections in cylindrical Poiseuille flow. Liu et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR60">60</CitationRef>] used a more precise model of the fluid flow around an array of cilia by numerically solving Stokes equations. They assumed small rotation at the cilium base although they computed the drag on cilium axoneme consistently from Stokes equations. Rydholm et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR61">61</CitationRef>] conducted computational fluid dynamics simulations of the bending of an elastic filament connected to an elastic membrane. From their simulations they found the stress distribution along a filament under flow with the maximum stress at the axoneme base, even though flexibility of the anchorage at the sub-axonemal compartments was not included in their simulations. They also conducted experiments illustrating the cilium bending and the subsequent variation in the intracellular calcium concentration. Although they did not provide any validation of their simulations by comparing against their experiments.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par14">Three-dimensional (3D) imaging of primary cilia under steady fluid flow allowed Downs et al. to investigate the mechanical properties of primary cilia in detail [<CitationRef CitationID="CR62">62</CitationRef>]. Results from the experiments revealed several patterns of primary cilia deflection and different post-flow relaxation patterns [<CitationRef CitationID="CR62">62</CitationRef>]. The vast majority exhibited a smooth bending curve similar to those previously reported (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">5.2</InternalRef>a–c). Occasionally deflections without axoneme bending were observed, see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">5.2</InternalRef>d. These straight deflections were characterized by large rotations at the cilium base and relatively little bending along the axoneme, perhaps indicative of a decreased degree of cilium anchorage and axonemal stiffening. At higher flow rates another behavior was observed: A kinked cilium characterized by two linear segments of low bending joined by a localized region of high curvature (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">5.2</InternalRef>e). After flow was stopped, some cilia did not return to the pre-flow shape. Other cilia displayed a recovery towards the original pre-flow position (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">5.3</InternalRef>). This would indicate that primary cilia are capable of undergoing both elastic and plastic deformation.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig2">

The activation time for intracellular calcium influx is a few seconds [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR61">61</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR64">64</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR65">65</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para ID="Par18">Currently, it is not feasible to simulate the bending dynamics of primary cilia using molecular dynamics (MD) computations, coarse-grained calculations, or direct numerical simulations of a continuum model that considers the underlying physics on distinct space and timescales, let alone the subsequent signaling processes over several microns and several tens of seconds. However, MD simulations can provide quantitative understanding of the connection between the mechanical behavior of the primary cilium and its molecular configuration. For example, the conformation of acetylated tubulin may promote binding of MAPs (microtubule associated proteins) and hence alter the flexural rigidity of the axoneme. A normal mode analysis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR66">66</CitationRef>] of the MD simulations of such molecular alterations under stress can be obtained from the continuum model, and will provide a flexural rigidity that varies along the axoneme. This may, in turn, be fed to a continuum model for a better estimate of stress distribution. Success of such coupling between MD simulations and continuum modeling hinges on developing a physically consistent continuum model that can capture all the essential primary cilium mechanical behaviors.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par19">To construct a multi-physics model of primary cilium mechanics some questions should be considered: (1) How many degrees of freedom are associated with axonemal bending in response to fluid flow? Is the ciliary axoneme, because of its radial symmetry, capable of a bending response equally in all possible directions? Are the same signaling pathways activated in response to fluid flow from different directions? (2) How do we quantitatively describe the mechanical behavior of the primary cilium under hydrodynamic load? (3) What is the relation between ciliary mechanical behavior, its 3D orientation and location on the membrane? (4) How should we understand the mechanosensing processes in terms of coupling the mechanical behavior of the primary cilium to the rest of the cell through signaling pathways? (5) Is there a threshold of bending required to activate signal transduction? Are the same pathways activated at different degrees of bending? Is the system toggled and/or does it undergo a refractory period after bending?</Para>
            <Para ID="Par20">From our experience in modeling primary cilia, we have found that the interaction between fluid flow and the primary cilium axoneme should be accurately considered to reproduce the equilibrium profiles of primary cilia under flow [<CitationRef CitationID="CR62">62</CitationRef>]. We further find that the cilium base behaves like a nonlinear rotational spring, and this may be modeled with coupling between the cilium axoneme and an elastic shell with a local torque at the contact point [<CitationRef CitationID="CR63">63</CitationRef>]. This particular result shows that, due to the multiscale structures of the primary cilium, a multiscale model is necessary to capture the essential mechanics and dynamics of the primary cilium and the connected microtubule network.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par21">The long-term goal for modeling of primary cilia is to decipher coupling between their mechanical behavior (such as bending under a hydrodynamic load) with biochemical processes (initiated by their responses to mechanical loads), such as the opening of ion channels or cascades of cellular (or intercellular) signals. For example, is it possible that IFT is affected by the load on the axoneme through bending? Is it possible to construct a multiscale model that will couple the mechanics of an elastic axoneme to the cellular signaling as in the case of the cochlear amplifier and sensory hair cells [<CitationRef CitationID="CR67">67</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR68">68</CitationRef>]? It is not clear how mechanosensitive channels open in response to the deflection of the ciliary axoneme and/or the displacement of the ciliary membrane around the basal body. It is also not clear if the deflection at the ciliary tip may be more important than at the base when it comes to mechanotransduction. Numerical simulations suggest that the maximum strain on the ciliary membrane is at the base [<CitationRef CitationID="CR61">61</CitationRef>]. Yet without a detailed description of the distributions and responses of the mechanosensitive channels, this information is insufficient for further understanding of the biological functions of primary cilia.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par22">In the cochlear amplifier, displacements of the hair cells and the hair cell bundles are coupled to the basilar membrane and the organ of corti through the electromotility of the outer hair cells and the gating of the mechanosensitive channels associated with the outer hair cell bundles (see review [<CitationRef CitationID="CR69">69</CitationRef>] and references therein).

In 2012 we advanced previous models [<CitationRef CitationID="CR58">58</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR60">60</CitationRef>] by taking into account the large rotation at the cilium base and a consistent hydrodynamic drag force [<CitationRef CitationID="CR62">62</CitationRef>]. Later, we used the slender-body theory (SBT) to compute the hydrodynamic interaction more accurately with large deformation of the cilium under a planar shear flow [<CitationRef CitationID="CR63">63</CitationRef>]. Within the SBT framework we incorporated a rotational stiffness at the axoneme base to model the basal anchorage, and we obtained good quantitative agreement in the dynamics of cilium bending under flow with experiments. We further used this model to investigate the ciliary dynamics with a more complex temporally periodic flow (see Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec10">5.4.2.2</InternalRef>), and the bending dynamics of a cilium with a time-varying length that depends on the balance between axonemal assembly and dissemble rates (see Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec12">5.6</InternalRef>).</Para>

              <Para ID="Par24">Downs et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR62">62</CitationRef>] modeled the primary cilium axoneme as an elastic, homogeneous beam with a uniform cross-section along the centerline. Under load the bending of such an elastic beam can be described by Euler-Bernoulli beam theory:<Equation ID="Equ1">

Equation <InternalRef RefID="Equ4">5.4</InternalRef> is the drag force acting on a beam that is slightly deformed. When the elastic beam is highly deformed, the slender-body theory (see Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec5">5.3.2</InternalRef>) can better capture the drag force [<CitationRef CitationID="CR63">63</CitationRef>]. In addition to the above closed-form approach they also conducted a computational study using the commercial finite-element code COMSOL to simulate the interaction between a viscous fluid and a cylinder (a model for a section of a cilium) in a low Reynolds number planar flow [<CitationRef CitationID="CR62">62</CitationRef>]. The angle between the cylinder and the vertical was veried from <InlineEquation ID="IEq54">

                <Para ID="Par35">We recently applied the elastic beam-shell model to examine the dynamics of a primary cilium under a periodic flow with a sinusoidal temporal variation. Such a periodic flow is motivated by the physiological conditions in kidney and bone marrow, where primary cilia are thought to undergo repetitive bending. It has also been observed that the basal anchorage may deteriorate due to repeated bending over a long time. This observation illustrates the complex nature of the basal body and the surrounding cytoskeletal structures.</Para>

[<CitationRef CitationID="CR75">75</CitationRef>] pointed out that very little is known about the subciliary compartment and the details of the basal support. Structurally, the majority of microtubules contributing to the anchoring of the primary cilium assemble and emanate from around the basal body, which is a modified form of the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR76">76</CitationRef>]. Modifying the microtubule attachment of primary cilia would change primary cilia mechanics and, possibly, their mechanosensitivity [<CitationRef CitationID="CR77">77</CitationRef>]. Several attempts have been made to count the number of microtubules emanating from the basal body and the results are found to depend on the cell type [<CitationRef CitationID="CR78">78</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR79">79</CitationRef>]. It has also been shown that the cellular response to shear stress depends on microtubular integrity [<CitationRef CitationID="CR80">80</CitationRef>]. In our preliminary results we find an increase in microtubules around primary cilia and a conformation change within the microtubule network in response to oscillatory fluid flow (OFF) stimulation (more details can be found in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR81">81</CitationRef>]).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig11">

The mechanical transduction of such a random, semi-flexible, cross-linked biopolymer network is a very challenging subject because its in vivo properties are expected to be highly dependent on the length and timescales on which they are being probed. The static mechanical properties of such networks have been investigated in the linear response regime [<CitationRef CitationID="CR86">86</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR88">88</CitationRef>]. Such networks can be constructed by sequential random deposition of monodisperse filaments into a two-dimensional box. Since the position and orientation of filaments are uniformly distributed over the allowed ranges, the networks are isotropic and homogeneous on sufficiently large scales. Each intersection between filaments is a cross link. The elastic moduli can be computed from the discrete Hamiltonian that consists of both the discrete bending energy and compression/extensional energy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR89">89</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR91">91</CitationRef>].</Para>

            <Para ID="Par44">The mechanics of the primary cilium has been extensively investigated experimentally. Several attempts have been made to theoretically model its bending mechanics. From our modeling approaches we find that it is essential to capture the fluid–structure interaction between fluid flow and the elastic ciliary axoneme. The slender-body theory is modified to incorporate the basal body anchorage, which behaves like a nonlinear rotational spring. With such rotational stiffness at the cilium base, the slender-body model reproduces the experimentally observed bending dynamics, and sheds light on the repetitive bending of primary cilia.</Para>
            <Para ID="Par45">The primary cilium has been known to play an important mechanosensory role in numerous tissues across many species and organisms [<CitationRef CitationID="CR92">92</CitationRef>]. The cilium’s ability to do so depends on its adaptation to different situations. For example, the primary cilium is able to dynamically modulate its length, and thus, fine tune its sensitivity to the extracellular environment. By blocking calcium ion entry and increasing intracellular cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), Besschetnova et al. recently demonstrated that the length of the primary cilium (in a mammalian epithelia and mesenchymal cells) increased two-fold in 3 h [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>].

            <Para ID="Par47">Another phenomenon that requires more experimental observations for accurate multiscale modeling is the varying circumferential arrangement of the microtubule doublets along the axoneme [<CitationRef CitationID="CR96">96</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR97">97</CitationRef>]. Although the cause of this nonhomogeneous organization is unclear, it is most likely due to the lack of interconnecting attachments such as nexin links between axonemal doublets. The mechanical consequence of the disrupted circumferential organization may give rise to inhomogeneous bending rigidity along the length of the cilium.</Para>
