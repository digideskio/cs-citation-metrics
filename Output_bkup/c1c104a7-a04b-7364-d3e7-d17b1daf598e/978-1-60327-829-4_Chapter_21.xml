            <Para TextBreak="No">Angiogenesis is a complex cascade of events involving extensive interplay between cells, soluble factors, and extracellular matrix components. Soluble factors including cytokines and growth factors have multifaceted stimulatory or inhibitory roles, thereby finely tuning the process. The angiogenic potential of tumors was initially demonstrated in animal models, and it is now recognized that angiogenesis not only precedes tumor growth but is also necessary for metastasis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a central role in prostate angiogenesis. Genetic variability of VEGF involves mainly the untranslated region of the gene and may be associated with increased VEGF transcription and protein expression. Indeed, the -1154G&gt;A polymorphism increases VEGF transcription and has been associated with significantly increased risk of prostate cancer. Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a transcription factor overexpressed in early stage prostate cancer; through its binding to hypoxic responsive elements, it activates the transcription of a wide variety of genes as a part of the cellular response to hypoxia, including VEGF, and potentially plays a key role in prostate cancer development and response to antiangiogenic drugs. Therefore, angiogenesis-related genes seem to have an important role in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness, thus influencing the outcome of antiangiogenic treatments and survival of patients.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">The increasing incidence of prostate cancer and the pivotal role that tumor-driven angiogenesis has in the aggressive behavior of this malignancy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1_21">1</CitationRef>] have led to the evaluation of several antiangiogenic drugs in prostate cancer clinical trials [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2_21">2</CitationRef>]. As a matter of fact, the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and normalization of blood vessels may circumvent several mechanisms of chemoresistance, allowing the achievement of a better clinical response. During the last years, the therapeutic scenario has been significantly changed because of the introduction in clinical trials of newer drugs acting at different levels along the angiogenic pathway. However, the most interesting targets are represented by the vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and/or its receptors, against which monoclonal antibodies, “small molecules” inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase domain or immunomodulatory agents have been tested.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting the VEGF-A isoform, to prevent the binding of the growth factor to its receptors, hence inhibiting the angiogenesis process. While bevacizumab did not show meaningful activity as a single agent in prostate cancer patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3_21">3</CitationRef>], when it was combined with other drugs (i.e., docetaxel and thalidomide), it was effective in reducing the levels of PSA [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4_21">4</CitationRef>]. Thalidomide, whose antiangiogenic activity has been demonstrated in several in vitro and in vivo animal models, although its exact molecular mechanism remains to be fully elucidated, it seems to be effective in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5_21">5</CitationRef>], because in several studies, performed in CRPC subjects, thalidomide alone or in combination with other agents (i.e., docetaxel and bevacizumab) was able to increase the response rate observed with docetaxel alone and measured as decline of PSA &gt;50% [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6_21">6</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR7_21">7</CitationRef>]. These encouraging results are prompting to the evaluation of the thalidomide analog lenalidomide [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8_21">8</CitationRef>], which shows an improved tolerability and similar effectiveness with respect to thalidomide in clinical trials in patients affected by multiple myeloma [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9_21">9</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">VEGF and endothelial growth factor (EGF) stimulation of prostate cancer cells occurs via the activation of the tyrosine-kinase (TK) domain within the cytoplasmic portion of the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) and EGF receptor (EGFR) (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">21.1</InternalRef>). Because this step is crucial for signal transduction, several TK inhibitors have been developed and some of them are now in clinical evaluation for the treatment of prostate cancer. Among the newer drugs, sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), an inhibitor of B-raf and C-raf isoforms, is able to reduce signal transduction through VEGFR2, VEGFR3, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF)-β [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10_21">10</CitationRef>]. In castration-resistant prostate cancer patients, the drug has been demonstrated to be effective as single agent when responses were assessed by PSA levels and RECIST criteria [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11_21">11</CitationRef>], despite other studies showed some discordances between PSA and objective responses [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12_21">12</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13_21">13</CitationRef>]. Other inhibitors of VEGF TK activity are under clinical evaluation in prostate cancer patients. AZD2171, a pan-VEGFR inhibitor [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14_21">14</CitationRef>] and sunitinib (SU011248) seem to have a promising role in prostate cancer treatment. Finally, integrin signaling (cilengitide, EMD 121974) as well as mammalian target of rapamycin (RAD001) are being evaluated as potential target of angiogenesis in prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3_21">3</CitationRef>].

            <Heading>Genetic Variants of VEGF Gene and Prostate Cancer</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Polymorphisms are naturally occurring DNA sequence variations, which differ from mutations in that they occur in the healthy population and have a frequency of at least 1%. Approximately, 90% of DNA polymorphisms are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) due to single base substitutions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15_21">15</CitationRef>]. Others include insertion/deletion polymorphisms, minisatellite polymorphisms, and microsatellite polymorphisms. Although most polymorphisms are functionally neutral (i.e., intronic and exonic synonymous SNPs), some have effects on regulation of gene expression or on the function of the coded protein [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15_21">15</CitationRef>]. These functional polymorphisms, despite having low penetrance, could contribute to the differences between individuals in susceptibility to and severity of disease as well as to responsiveness to drug treatment. Certain polymorphisms alone, in combination or by interaction with environmental factors may affect the angiogenic pathway and thereby susceptibility to the development of selected cancers [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15_21">15</CitationRef>]. Identification of the role of angiogenic gene polymorphisms that influence cancer susceptibility and/or severity may improve the understanding of tumor angiogenesis and may influence risk stratification and detection, use of new treatment strategies, and definition of prognosis of the disease [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15_21">15</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Studies specifically addressing the involvement of genetic variants of angiogenesis-related genes, VEGF in particular, in the risk of prostate cancer and response to treatment are few and quite frequently in disagreement with each other. Potential reasons are as follows: (1) small cohort of patients, (2) criteria of disease stratification, (3) ethnic stratification, (4) retrospective design, (5) choice of polymorphism, and (6) lack of validation of techniques for genome analysis.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">A study examined the association between 58 SNPs in nine angiogenesis-related candidate genes, namely epidermal growth factor (EGF), lymphotoxin-α (LT-α), hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), HIF-1α subunit inhibitor (HIF-1αN), metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), MMP9, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2A), and VEGF, and the risk of overall and advanced prostate cancer in a large cohort of prostate cancer patients (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis> = 1,425) and controls (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis> = 1,453) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16_21">16</CitationRef>]. No associations were found between either SNPs in VEGF, HIF-1α, or NOS3, nor SNPs in EGF, LT-α, HIF-1αN, MMP9, or NOS2A and prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16_21">16</CitationRef>]. In the MMP2 gene, three intronic SNPs, all in linkage disequilibrium, were apparently associated with overall and advanced prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16_21">16</CitationRef>]. However, two of these SNPs (rs17301608 and rs11639960) were examined, and their association was not confirmed when the results of this study were pooled with those from the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovary cohort study; neither SNP was associated with prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16_21">16</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The single-gene approach in association studies of polygenic diseases is likely to provide limited value in predicting risk. The combined analysis of genetic variants that interact in the same pathway may amplify the effects of individual polymorphisms and enhance the predictive power. To evaluate higher order gene–gene interaction, a study has examined the contribution of four gene polymorphisms of factors involved in angiogenesis (VEGF -1154G&gt;A, VEGF 634G&gt;C, MMP9 1562C&gt;T, and TSP1 8831A&gt;G) in combination to the risk of prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17_21">17</CitationRef>]. For the combined analysis of VEGF and MMP9 SNPs, it was found a significant gene–dosage effect for increasing numbers of potential high-risk genotypes. Compared to referent group (low-risk genotypes), individuals with one (OR = 2.79), two (OR = 4.57), and three high-risk genotypes (OR = 7.11) had increasingly elevated risks (OR, odd ratio) of prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17_21">17</CitationRef>]. Similarly, gene–gene interaction of VEGF and thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) polymorphisms increased the risk of prostate cancer in additive manner (OR = 6.00, <Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis> = 0.03), although the TSP1 polymorphism itself was not associated with the risk [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17_21">17</CitationRef>]. In addition, the analysis of the synergistic effect of these polymorphisms, in relation to prostate cancer prognosis according to histopathological grade and clinical stage at diagnosis, revealed potential higher order gene–gene interactions between VEGF and TSP1 polymorphisms in increasing the risk of developing an aggressive phenotype disease [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17_21">17</CitationRef>]. Patients carrying three high-risk genotypes showed a 20-fold increased risk of high-grade tumor (OR = 20.75). These results suggest that the interaction between polymorphic genes increase the risk of prostate cancer and its aggressiveness [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17_21">17</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Another study evaluated the role of the functional VEGF polymorphisms as genetic markers for prostate cancer susceptibility and prognosis. The study included 101 patients with prostate cancer and 100 age-matched healthy men. The VEGF genotypes -1154G&gt;A were identified by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, and the genotypes -634G&gt;C and 936C&gt;T were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18_21">18</CitationRef>]. The study found a negative association between VEGF -1154G&gt;A genotype and prostate cancer risk (OR = 0.27). Furthermore, the presence of the VEGF -1154A allele appeared to be associated with an increased risk of higher tumor grade (OR = 0.37) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18_21">18</CitationRef>]. A significant increased risk of prostate cancer was associated with the VEGF -634 (GC + CC) combined genotype (OR = 1.95). The VEGF -634C allele was associated with the aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer as defined by the high histological grade (OR = 3.48). On the contrary, the VEGF -1154A/-634G haplotype was negatively associated with prostate cancer risk (OR = 0.48) and high tumor grade compared to low grade (OR = 0.37) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18_21">18</CitationRef>]. Therefore, in this study, genetic variations in the VEGF may predict not only prostate cancer risk but also tumor aggressiveness [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18_21">18</CitationRef>] (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">21.1</InternalRef>).<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab1">

            <Para TextBreak="No">A study investigated the potential association between DNA sequence variations in VEGF –460 gene region and occurrence of sporadic prostate cancer patients in the Turkish population. Two cohorts of 133 sporadic prostate cancer patients and 157 healthy controls were examined. Genotypes were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction analysis. The distribution of genotype and allele frequencies of the polymorphism did not show a statistically significant difference between patients and controls [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19_21">19</CitationRef>]. Furthermore, classification of patients by tumor-lymph nodes-metastasis stage, Gleason scores, and PSA levels did not demonstrate significant differences among the VEGF –460C&gt;T genotypes. This negative study demonstrated that the VEGF –460C&gt;T polymorphism in men is not associated with sporadic prostate cancer at least in the Turkish population [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19_21">19</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Polymorphisms in the promoter regions of cytokine genes may influence prostate cancer development <Emphasis Type="Italic">via</Emphasis> regulation of the antitumor immune response and/or pathways of tumor angiogenesis. Prostate cancer patients (247) and 263 healthy controls were genotyped for interleukin (IL)-1β 511C&gt;T, IL-8 251A&gt;T, IL-10 1082A&gt;G, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α 308A&gt;G, and VEGF -1154A&gt;G single nucleotide polymorphisms [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20_21">20</CitationRef>]. IL-8 TT and VEGF AA genotypes were decreased in patients compared with controls (23.9 versus 32.3%, OR = 0.66 and 6.3 versus 12.9%, OR = 0.45, respectively), whereas the IL-10 AA genotype was significantly increased in patients compared with controls (31.6 versus 20.6%, OR = 1.78) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20_21">20</CitationRef>]. Stratification according to prognostic indicators showed significant association between IL-8 genotype and log PSA level. Therefore, these results suggest that single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with differential production of IL-8, IL-10, and VEGF are risk factors for prostate cancer, possibly acting via their influence on angiogenesis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20_21">20</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">A haplotype represents a linear arrangement of alleles at different SNPs on a single chromosome, or part of a chromosome. The pair of haplotypes is called a diplotype and the observed phenotype of a diplotype is called a genotype. A case–control study addressed the role of VEGF single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes in prostate cancer by including 702 prostate cancer patients and 702 male age-matched healthy control subjects. Seven VEGF candidate polymorphisms (–2578C&gt;A, –2498C&gt;T, –1498C&gt;T, –634G&gt;C, –7C&gt;T, 936C&gt;T, and 1612GA) were determined and VEGF plasma levels and genotypes were analyzed in a group of 64 healthy men [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21_21">21</CitationRef>]. Haplotype analysis showed two separate blocks of high-linkage disequilibrium, formed by five polymorphisms upstream of the coding sequence (–2578C&gt;A, –2498C&gt;T, –1498C&gt;T, –634G&gt;C, and –7C&gt;T) and two polymorphisms downstream of the coding sequence (936C&gt;T and 1612G&gt;A). None of the single polymorphisms or haplotypes was significantly associated with the presence of prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21_21">21</CitationRef>]. In a multivariate regression analysis including age, VEGF genotypes, and haplotypes as covariates and VEGF plasma level as dependent variable, none of the VEGF polymorphisms or haplotypes was a significant predictor of VEGF plasma levels [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21_21">21</CitationRef>]. The present data suggest that polymorphisms or haplotypes in the VEGF gene do not modify the risk of prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21_21">21</CitationRef>].</Para>

            <Heading>Genetic Variants of Endostatin Gene and Prostate Cancer</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Endostatin is an important molecule and one of the most potent inhibitors of angiogenesis. Lower level or impaired function of endostatin is associated with a higher risk of developing malignant solid tumors and with a worse prognosis of the disease. The missense change D104N (aspartic acid [D] to asparagine [N]), which corresponds to amino acid position 1437 and nucleotide 4349G&gt;A of the cDNA medium form of collagen XVIII, leads to the creation of a restriction site for MseI [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22_21">22</CitationRef>]. The association study between the coding single nucleotide polymorphism (D104N) in endostatin and prostate cancer revealed that heterozygous N104 individuals have a 2.5 times increased chance of developing prostate cancer as compared with homozygous D104 subjects (OR, 2.4). Modeling of the endostatin mutant showed that the N104 protein is stable [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22_21">22</CitationRef>]. These results together with the observation that residue 104 is evolutionary conserved suggest that: (a) the DNA segment containing this residue might include a novel interaction site to a yet unknown receptor and (b) the presence of N104 impairs the function of endostatin [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22_21">22</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The same D104N polymorphism was analyzed in the tissues from 98 Caucasian prostate cancer patients. The frequencies of homozygous 4349G/G (104D/D) and heterozygous 4349G/A (104D/N) were 83.67% and 16.33%, respectively; no individuals were found to be homozygous for 4349A/A (104N/N) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23_21">23</CitationRef>]. Analyses of genotype frequencies by Fisher’s exact test showed that the genotype of D104N was not significantly related to tumor grade, PSA, and clinical stage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23_21">23</CitationRef>]. There was no difference in relapse-free survival or overall survival between patients with 104D/N and those with 104D/D. The study concluded that endostatin polymorphism was not associated with the aggressiveness of prostate cancer in Caucasian patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23_21">23</CitationRef>] (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">21.2</InternalRef>).<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab2">

            <Heading>Genetic Variants of HIF Gene and Prostate Cancer</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">HIF-1α regulates cellular responses to hypoxia and is rapidly degraded under normoxia through von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mediated ubiquitination. Although HIF-1α stabilization appears to be the molecular basis for VHL-associated cancers, stabilizing mutations in HIF-1α have not been reported. A study examined metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancers for mutations in the oxygen-dependent domain (ODD) of HIF-1α by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24_21">24</CitationRef>]. A somatic proline to serine mutation in codon 582 (P582S) was identified in one sample. Transfection studies with a HIF-1α regulated reporter gene showed increased transcriptional activity that correlated with higher mutant HIF-1α protein expression [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24_21">24</CitationRef>]. It was found that increased expression of the P582S mutant induced by iron chelation, which blocks proline hydroxylation of wild-type HIF-1α, was markedly attenuated. The mutant also showed increased stability under normoxic versus hypoxic conditions. The P582S HIF-1α is a stable variant and HIF-1α mutation is a mechanism for enhancing HIF-1α activity in human cancer. Therefore, this variant may increase tumor susceptibility or cause more aggressive biological behavior [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24_21">24</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">A second study examined a cohort of prostate cancer patients (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis> = 1,072 incident cases) and 1,271 controls for the prevalence of two nonsynonymous polymorphisms (P582S C&gt;T and A588T G&gt;A) in the coding region of HIF-1α gene, which have been associated with enhanced stability of the protein and androgen-independent prostate cancer. The study also investigated the levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-3, which is more abundantly expressed in hypoxia-related inflammatory angiogenesis and recent in vivo data suggest that IGFBP-3 has direct IGF-independent inhibitory effects on angiogenesis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25_21">25</CitationRef>]. Neither the P582S nor the A588T polymorphism was associated with the risk of overall or metastatic/fatal prostate cancer. However, the study found that among men with the homozygous CC wildtype (but not CT/TT) of the HIF-1α P582S, higher IGFBP-3 levels were associated with a 28% lower risk of overall prostate cancer and a 53% lower risk of metastatic and fatal prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25_21">25</CitationRef>]. The occurrence of A588T polymorphism in the population of patients enrolled in this study was too rare to assess interactions. Therefore, the two HIF-1α gene polymorphisms selected in this study were not directly associated with prostate cancer, although the authors suggested that the interaction between the P582S polymorphism and IGFBP-3 merits further evaluation in mechanistic studies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25_21">25</CitationRef>].</Para>

            <Heading>Genetic Variants of PDGF and PDGFR Gene and Prostate Cancer</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Although there are no studies published thus far on the role of genetic variants of PDGF and PDGFR-α/-β in the progression of prostate cancer, several direct evidences are in favor of its involvement. Therefore, variability in PDGF production or PDGFR expression may play an important role in prostate cancer biology.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In vitro, prostate carcinoma cell lines DU-145 and PC-3 express both PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β genes. Concomitantly, these cells synthesize and secrete PDGF-like proteins [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26_21">26</CitationRef>]. Both DU-145 and PC-3 cell lines appear to lack receptors for PDGF as indicated by their inability to mitogenically respond to PDGF and receptor binding of <Superscript>125</Superscript>I-labeled PDGF [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26_21">26</CitationRef>]. Production of PDGF-like proteins by human prostate carcinoma cells may play an important role in a paracrine mode in the organization of the extracellular matrix of the malignant tissue and stimulate the development of angiogenesis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26_21">26</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">A study analyzed the combined VEGF (SU5416) and PDGF (SU6668) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition with irradiation in human endothelial (HUVEC) and prostate cancer (PC3) cells in vitro and in vivo. Combined inhibition of VEGF and PDGF signaling resulted in enhanced apoptosis, reduced cell proliferation, and clonogenic survival as well as reduced endothelial cell migration and tube formation compared with single pathway inhibition. These effects were further enhanced by additional irradiation. Likewise, in PC3 tumors grown subcutaneously (s.c.) on BALB/c nu/nu mice, dual inhibition of VEGF and PDGF signaling significantly increased tumor growth delay than in each monotherapy. Radiation at approximately 20% of the dose necessary to induce local tumor control exerts similar tumor growth-inhibitory effects as the antiangiogenic drugs given at their maximum effective dose. Addition of radiotherapy to both mono- as well as dual-antiangiogenic treatments markedly increased tumor growth delay. With respect to tumor angiogenesis, radiation further decreased microvessel density (CD31 count) and tumor cell proliferation (Ki-67 index) in all drug-treated groups. Of note, the slowly growing PC3 tumor responded well to the antiangiogenic drug treatments. Interestingly, radiation induced up-regulation of all four isoforms of PDGF in endothelial cells resulting in a prosurvival effect of radiation. The addition of SU6668 attenuated this undesirable paracrine radiation effect, which may rationalize the combined application of radiation with PDGF signaling inhibition to increase antitumor effects in prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR27_21">27</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The factors regulating the bone tropism of disseminated prostate cancer cells are still vaguely defined. Prostate cancer cells that metastasize to the skeleton respond to human bone marrow with a robust stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, whereas prostate cells that lack bone-metastatic potential respond negligibly [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28_21">28</CitationRef>]. The majority of this Akt activation is dependent on PDGFRα signaling. Low concentrations of PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB found in bone marrow aspirates do not account for the high levels of PDGFRα signaling. Additionally, neutralization of PDGF binding using PDGFRα-specific antibody failed to produce a significant inhibition of bone marrow-induced Akt activation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28_21">28</CitationRef>]. However, the inhibitory effect of the antibody antagonized that of AG1296. The study concluded that PDGFRα is activated by multiple soluble factors contained within human bone marrow, in addition to its natural ligands, and this transactivation is dependent on receptor localization to the plasma membrane. Therefore, PDGFRα expression may provide selected prostate phenotypes with a growth advantage within the bone microenvironment [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28_21">28</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">To further assess the role of PDGF and its receptors in cancer biology and aggressiveness, a study selected multidrug-resistant human PC-3MM2 prostate cancer cells (PC-3MM2-MDR cells) by culturing them in increasing concentrations of paclitaxel [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29_21">29</CitationRef>]. PC-3MM2-MDR cells were implanted orthotopically into one tibia of 80 nude mice. Two weeks later, the mice were randomly assigned to receive vehicle control, paclitaxel, imatinib (an inhibitor of PDGFR), or imatinib plus paclitaxel for 10 weeks. The results showed that PC-3MM2-MDR cells were resistant to paclitaxel and imatinib in vitro [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29_21">29</CitationRef>]. Treatment of implanted mice with imatinib plus paclitaxel led to statistically significant decreases in bone tumor incidence, median tumor weight, bone lysis, and the incidence of lymph node metastasis. Treatment with imatinib alone had similar effects, and imatinib treatment also inhibited phosphorylation of PDGFR on tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells and increased the level of apoptosis of endothelial cells, but not tumor cells [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29_21">29</CitationRef>]. Treatment with imatinib alone or in combination with paclitaxel decreased mean vessel density, which was followed by apoptosis of tumor cells. These interesting results provide evidence that tumor-associated endothelial cells, rather than tumor cells themselves, appear to be the target for imatinib in prostate cancer bone metastasis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29_21">29</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Despite these promising preclinical data, the crucial issue is the selection of patients who may benefit from treatment with anti-PDGFR drugs. A study characterized the expression of PDGFR-β in a wide spectrum of prostate cancer samples to provide a rational basis to treatment strategy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30_21">30</CitationRef>]. A survey of five published prostate expression array studies, including 100 clinically localized prostate cancers, did not identify tumors with increased PDGFR-β expression level. Protein expression of PDGFR-β, as determined by immunohistochemistry, revealed 5% of clinically localized prostate cancers and 16% of metastatic prostate cancer cases to show moderate or strong expression [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30_21">30</CitationRef>]. To develop a strategy to detect patients most likely to benefit from anti-PDGF treatment, cDNA expression array data from 10,000 transcripts for PDGFR-β expression were examined and tumors were stratified based on PDGFR-β expression level [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30_21">30</CitationRef>]. Performing a supervised analysis to identify potential comarkers of PDGFR-β in prostate cancer, a set of genes were identified whose expression was associated with PDGFR-β status including early growth response 1 (Egr1), an upstream effector of PDGF (4.2-fold upregulation), alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, as well as v-Maf and neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity (both with a 2.2-fold downregulation) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30_21">30</CitationRef>]. This study suggests that only a small subset of prostate cancers is likely to benefit from treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors of PDGFR.</Para>

            <Heading>Genetic Variants of MMP and TNF Gene and Prostate Cancer</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) promoter displays polymorphic variants (1G/2G); this variation is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at –1607 bp, where an insertion of a guanine base (G) creates the sequence of 5′-GGAT-3′, the core binding site for members of the Ets family of transcription factors. A study on prostate carcinoma risk in the Turkish population analyzed a small cohort of 55 prostate cancer patients and 43 healthy controls and demonstrated that the frequency of 1G/2G genotypes in prostate cancer patients was similar to that of the controls [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31_21">31</CitationRef>]. Compared with the 1G/1G genotype, neither the 2G/2G nor a combination with the 1G/2G genotype significantly modified the risk of developing prostate cancer and metastasis. In addition, the frequencies of genotypes were not significantly different among patients stratified by family history of prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31_21">31</CitationRef>]. Therefore, the 2G allele of the MMP1 promoter polymorphism does not apparently modify the risk of prostate cancer, at least in the Turkish population [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31_21">31</CitationRef>] although these data should be taken with caution owing to the small cohort of patients examined.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Inflammation has been hypothesized to increase prostate cancer risk. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important mediator of the inflammatory process, but the relationship between TNF variants and prostate cancer remains unclear. Therefore, a study investigated the associations between TNF single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1799964, rs1800630, rs1799724, rs1800629, rs361525, rs1800610) and prostate cancer risk among 2,321 cases and 2,560 controls from two nested case-control studies within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial and the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32_21">32</CitationRef>]. No TNF SNP was associated with prostate cancer risk in PLCO, while in the Nutrition Cohort, associations were significant for two highly correlated variants (rs1799724 and rs1800610) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32_21">32</CitationRef>]. In pooled analyses, no single SNP was associated with prostate cancer risk. After adjustment for multiple testing, no SNP was associated with prostate cancer risk in either cohort individually or in the pooled analysis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32_21">32</CitationRef>]. Haplotypes based on five TNF SNPs did not vary by case/control status in PLCO but showed marginal associations in the Nutrition Cohort. Therefore, despite some results are suggestive of a borderline role of haplotype, overall no firm association has been found between TNF variants and prostate cancer risk [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32_21">32</CitationRef>].</Para>

            <Heading>Conclusions</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The development and progression of prostate cancer has biologically and genetically bases that remained a mystery. A man’s risk of developing prostate cancer is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in angiogenesis-dependent genes may affect to some extent the individual predisposition to developing cancer and may also affect disease progression. Polymorphisms in the angiogenic genes/factors may in part explain the variation in tumor angiogenesis observed among individuals. However, angiogenesis is a multifactorial process regulated by a plethora of factors and attempts to correlate prostate cancer risk and progression to specific angiogenic genotypes have been disappointing, although these studies have had the merit of having increased our knowledge on the biology of this complex disease. Well designed, large case–control studies are necessary to establish associations between polymorphisms and cancer, but as yet there are few such studies. Individual polymorphisms, even if proven to be functional, may only contribute to (and not solely determine) the heritable variation in protein levels and/or function. Many protein molecules acting along different carcinogenic pathways influence the development and spread of tumors, and hence the final outcome. It is therefore possible that specific combinations of polymorphisms within one or several genes will have a greater impact on the final phenotype than the individual polymorphisms.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">At the present time, polymorphisms in the VEGF, MMP and PA system and TNF genes seem to be promising in the quest for markers influencing the severity and extent of tumor angiogenesis. In parallel with the search for functional polymorphisms in angiogenesis related genes, epidemiological studies to detect associations of gene polymorphisms with disease phenotypes are desired.</Para>
