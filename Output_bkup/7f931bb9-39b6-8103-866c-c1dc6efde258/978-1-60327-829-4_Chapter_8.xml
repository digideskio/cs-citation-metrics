            <Para TextBreak="No">It is well recognized that the vast majority of prostate cancers rely on testosterone for growth. Even after medical or surgical castration, a significant number of men will unfortunately experience disease progression manifested as an increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or objective tumor growth. Left untreated, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is uniformly fatal. It causes close to 30,000 deaths annually in the United States, with most men living only 2–4 years from the time castration resistance develops. In recent years, research has shown that despite castration resistance these tumors still retain sensitivity to low levels of circulating testosterone and other androgens. By inhibiting androgen synthesis, targeted adrenal androgen synthesis inhibitors slow the growth of castration-resistant tumors. The major agents in use today include corticosteroids, ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide, estrogens and progestins, as well as the novel CYP17 inhibitors abiraterone acetate, TAK-700 and TOK-001. The following article reviews the clinical data supporting the use of each of these adrenal androgen synthesis inhibitors in advanced prostate cancer, including the dosing, schedules, and common side effects.</Para>

            <Heading>Introduction</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">For over 60 years, it has been recognized that testosterone plays a critical role in promoting the growth of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Huggins and Hodges received the 1967 Nobel Prize for their discovery that surgical or medical castration could produce a striking regression of metastatic prostate cancer (CaP) and improve bone pain, lower urinary tract symptoms, and quality of life [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1_8">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR2_8">2</CitationRef>]. Since then, hormonal suppression therapy has become the mainstay of treatment for men with metastatic prostate cancer at diagnosis or for men with rising PSA or recurrent CaP after definitive surgery or radiation. As surgical castration has become a less popular option in recent years, there has been growing interest in agents that can effectively deprive the growing tumor of androgenic stimulation.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In the United States, there currently exist three major anti-hormonal classes of agents to suppress the growth of prostate cancer. These include the GnRH or LHRH analogs leuprolide, goserelin, histrelin, degarelix, and triptorelin, the androgen receptor antagonists flutamide, bicalutamide, and nilutamide, and lastly the inhibitors of adrenal androgen synthesis, a heterogeneous group including corticosteroids, ketoconazole, and aminoglutethimide. More recently, abiraterone acetate, a specific inhibitor of 17 alpha-hydroxylase-17, 20-lyase (CYP17), has generated significant interest in clinical studies and is currently being evaluated in phase III studies. Two other inhibitors of CYP17, TAK-700 and TOK-001 have also begun early phase clinical testing. Estrogens may also be included in the category of androgen synthesis inhibitors, though they exert effects both in the adrenal gland as well as directly in the prostate cancer cell.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Given the wide array of agents available to treat patients with advanced prostate cancer, (defined as metastatic disease at diagnosis, or a rising PSA, or recurrent disease after definitive surgery/radiation) the choice of initial, second-line, and in many cases third- and fourth-line agents can be confusing to the practitioner. Particularly, when and where should adrenal androgen synthesis inhibitors be used? How effective are they at slowing the growth of prostate cancer? What are the major side effects of these therapies? To answer these questions, a review of the role of androgens in promoting the growth of prostate cancer will be helpful.</Para>

          <Section1 ID="Sec2">
            <Heading>The Role of Androgens</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">It has been long recognized that androgenic stimulation is the major factor promoting the growth and the malignant transformation of prostatic tissue. Androgens are a group of chemically related 19-carbon steroid hormones produced in the adrenal cortex, testis, and ovaries; all are derived from cholesterol, a common precursor. Androgens exert their effect on prostate cell primarily via interaction with the androgen receptor (AR); this interaction promotes growth and cell division, while at the same time inhibits apoptosis. Among the androgens, testosterone and its derivative dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are the most potent in terms of prostate tumorigenesis and growth stimulus, though androgens arising from the adrenal gland such as androstenedione, dehydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA), and DHEA-sulfate are capable of binding to and activating the AR [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3_8">3</CitationRef>]. It is important to remember that approximately 95% of all circulating testosterone is derived from the testes; the remainder is produced by the adrenal cortex. Thus, therapies targeting the adrenal glands can have an important role in further suppressing testosterone secretion.</Para>
          </Section1>
          <Section1 ID="Sec3">
            <Heading>Initial Therapy for Advanced Prostate Cancer: Orchiectomy and GnRH/LHRH Analogs</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The fact that prostate cancer is uniquely sensitive to androgenic stimulation provides a clear rationale for antihormonal therapy to slow the growth of prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the initial treatment of choice for advanced prostate cancer and aims to inhibit signals for growth and development provided by androgens and, in particular, by testosterone. ADT was traditionally accomplished via either bilateral surgical orchiectomy or the use of estrogens, particularly diethylstilbestrol (DES). While clinical trials proved DES to be as effective as orchiectomy in slowing tumor growth, the significant cardiovascular and thromboembolic toxicity associated with DES spurred the development and use of relatively less toxic GnRH/LHRH analogs. These agents markedly reduce circulating testosterone levels and induce state of castration, with fewer side effects than DES. The development and use of GnRH/LHRH analogs has since obviated the use of DES as a frontline therapy.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">GnRH/LHRH therapy and orchiectomy can markedly improve bony pain in up to 90% of patients with metastatic disease and can significantly slow objective tumor growth and PSA rise. A meta-analysis of ten trials encompassing 1,908 patients showed equivalence in overall survival between these two modalities [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4_8">4</CitationRef>]. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that ADT concurrent with or adjuvant to local therapies such as radiation or radical prostatectomy can improve disease-specific survival [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5_8">5</CitationRef>]. Guidelines issued by the American Society of Clinical Oncology currently recommend surgical castration or the use of a GnRH/LHRH analog as the initial treatment for advanced prostate cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6_8">6</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">An important aspect of LHRH therapy is that testosterone levels decline by approximately 90%, leaving a small amount in the circulation that would be capable of stimulating a tumor that is hypersensitive to these low levels.</Para>
          </Section1>
          <Section1 ID="Sec4">
            <Heading>Second-Line Therapies for Advanced Prostate Cancer: Anti-Androgens and Anti-androgen-Withdrawal</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The vast majority of patients with advanced prostate cancer treated initially with ADT in the form of LHRH agonist-based therapy will respond with a significant decrease in serum PSA and a reduction in radiographically evident disease. Despite this benefit, castration-resistant prostate cancer is likely to develop within a range of 18–24 months in most patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7_8">7</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Moderate incremental benefit can be achieved with either the immediate or deferred addition of oral anti-androgens such as flutamide, bicalutamide, or nilutamide, in what is termed combined androgen blockade (CAB). The addition of anti-androgens results in clinical response and improvement in quality of life in a majority of men; however, there is little data to suggest any overall survival benefit. With progression of disease and amplification (see below) of the androgen receptor (AR), the receptor may be paradoxically activated [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8_8">8</CitationRef>], and thus withdrawal of anti-androgens (anti-androgen withdrawal or AAWD) has, in some cases, resulted in a short-lived PSA decline and an improvement in clinical symptoms [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9_8">9</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10_8">10</CitationRef>]. After AAWD, some patients will benefit from using a second, or even third anti-androgen; the likelihood of response to second-line anti-androgen is generally higher if the patient exhibited a PSA decline with AAWD [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11_8">11</CitationRef>].</Para>
          </Section1>
          <Section1 ID="Sec5">
            <Heading>Progressive Disease: Mechanisms</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Persistent AR signaling is widely recognized to be a common molecular event underlying disease progression despite castrate levels of testosterone (commonly defined as serum testosterone &lt;50 ng/ml) and is referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer or CRPC. This signaling occurs through multiple mechanisms, including amplification of the AR itself, increased sensitivity of the AR to low levels of circulating androgens produced by the adrenal context or by the tumor itself, or by increased sensitivity of the AR to nonandrogen stimulators such as epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, and keratinocyte growth factor [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3_8">3</CitationRef>]. Taken together, these data suggest that the combination of persistent and alternative androgens coupled with a tumor that is hypersensitive to androgen stimulation play a major role in the development of tumor progression in the castrate state.</Para>
          </Section1>
          <Section1 ID="Sec6">
            <Heading>Adrenal Androgen Synthesis Inhibitors</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">While many of the mechanisms discussed here play a role in promoting growth in the castrate environment, it has become clear that despite castration resistance, CRPC still remains responsive to “secondary” hormonal manipulation. This was recognized early, and clinical trials using surgical adrenalectomy for advanced prostate cancer clearly showed that tumor growth can be slowed by decreasing circulating testosterone and nontestosterone androgens [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12_8">12</CitationRef>]. The understanding of the stimulatory effect of these nontesticular androgens on CRPC provides the rationale for the ongoing use and development of inhibitors of adrenal androgen synthesis.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Broadly defined, several agents are available that exert inhibitory effects on the interaction of adrenal androgens and the AR, including corticosteroids, the antifungal agent ketoconazole, estrogenic compounds such as DES, the rarely used drug aminoglutethimide, and more recently, abiraterone acetate, TAK-700, and TOK-001. The common thread linking all of these agents is their net effect on decreasing androgen synthesis by the adrenal cortex, either through direct inhibition of enzymes involved in androgen synthesis (ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide, abiraterone acetate, TAK-700, and TOK-001) or through feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic/pituitary axis (corticosteroids and estrogens). Each of these agents is variably effective at slowing down prostate tumor growth, and each carries its own side effects and toxicities.</Para>
            <Section2 ID="Sec7">
              <Heading>Adrenalectomy</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Bilateral surgical adrenalectomy was demonstrated to have a clear antitumor effect in the 1940s [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12_8">12</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13_8">13</CitationRef>]. Due to the high morbidity of surgery, the need for lifelong corticosteroid replacement, and better outcomes with medical approaches, its use has been largely abandoned in favor of medical therapies that more directly target adrenal androgen biosynthesis pathways.</Para>
            </Section2>
            <Section2 ID="Sec8">
              <Heading>Corticosteroids</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Corticosteroids function in a wide range of physiologic systems and are involved in the regulation of blood pressure, inflammation, the systemic immune response, serum electrolytes, and in protein and carbohydrate metabolism. Like the androgens, they are all synthesized in the adrenal cortex from the common precursor cholesterol.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Corticosteroid production is regulated by a complex feedback loop involving the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and the adrenal glands. Exogenous use of corticosteroids causes a disruption in this hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis; high levels of circulating corticosteroids cause a decrease in coticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion by the hypothalamus. This leads to decreased secretion of corticotropin (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. Low circulating ACTH levels then lead to adrenal cortical atrophy and reduction in endogenous corticosteroid production. A side effect of this adrenal atrophy is a decrease in endogenous androgen production, making corticosteroid therapy a potential tool for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Besides inhibiting tumor growth by indirectly downregulating adrenal androgen production, corticosteroids may directly inhibit tumor growth through disruption of intracellular signaling pathways and suppression of tumor lymphangiogenesis [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14_8">14</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR17_8">17</CitationRef>]. While not yet fully characterized, this direct cytotoxicity likely exerts a modest effect in suppressing tumor growth in CRPC. As single agents, corticosteroids have been tested in multiple clinical trials in men with CRPC. In one study, 37 patients with CRPC were treated with daily oral prednisone at doses of 7.5–10 mg. After one month of therapy, improvements in quality of life were noted in 38% of patients, and in 19% of patients, the effect was maintained for a median of 4 months [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18_8">18</CitationRef>]. Similar results have been noted in other small studies, with PSA decreases of &gt;50% reported in anywhere from 16 to 61% of patients. The two largest randomized trials incorporating corticosteroid-only control arms showed a 22 and 16% response rates respectively [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19_8">19</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR20_8">20</CitationRef>]. Median duration of response in many of these studies was short, in the order of 4 months. Small studies have suggested that dexamethasone may be the most potent of the corticosteroids, with data suggesting that 0.75 mg of dexamethasone given orally three times a day may have higher antitumor activity than prednisone or hydrocortisone [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21_8">21</CitationRef>]. Taken together, the data from clinical trials using single-agent corticosteroids as therapy for prostate cancer show that they have, at best, modest activity in the disease. One possible explanation of the mechanism of resistance to or lack of activity of corticosteroids may come from the peripheral conversion of exogenous glucocorticoids into androgens or androgen precursors, which then stimulate tumor growth.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The systemic side effects of glucocorticoids generally limit high-dose or long-term therapy. They include hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, immune suppression, osteoporosis, cataract development, weight gain, anxiety and mood instability, and others. Careful attention should be paid to the discontinuation of therapy as abrupt cessation of long-term therapy can lead to corticosteroid withdrawal and precipitate an Addisonian crisis.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Despite their modest activity as single-agent therapy, corticosteroids still play significant role in palliation of bony pain attributable to metastatic disease. In low doses, they are frequently used to supplement other adrenolytic therapies such as ketoconazole or abiraterone acetate and can additionally help palliate nausea and other side effects of chemotherapy. More importantly, corticosteroids, particularly prednisone, have consistently been used as a control arm in clinical trials of chemotherapies for prostate cancer. Phase III studies of mitoxantrone/prednisone vs. prednisone, satraplatin/prednisone vs. prednisone, and now abiraterone/prednisone vs. prednisone attest the widespread recognition that corticosteroids exert some benefit to patients with CRPC, likely, in part, due to their ability to decrease adrenal androgen synthesis.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Clinical data supporting the effectiveness of aminoglutethimide show that approximately half of the patients achieve an 80% decline in PSA level when aminoglutethimide is administered concomitantly with replacement dose hydrocortisone along with flutamide withdrawal [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22_8">22</CitationRef>]. Another similar study showed a greater than 50% PSA decrease in 37% of patients with CRPC treated with 1,000 mg aminoglutethimide daily and 40 mg hydrocortisone daily with a median duration of response of 9 months and median survival of 23 months. A more recent phase III randomized controlled trial comparing vinorelbine plus hydrocortisone vs. hydrocortisone alone in which individual centers could choose to add aminoglutethimide to hydrocortisone failed to demonstrate improvement with aminoglutethimide in either group [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23_8">23</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Aminoglutethimide is dosed 250 mg orally three times daily for 3 weeks and then increased to four times daily. Due to its inhibition of glucocorticoid synthesis, it is usually given with either prednisone or an equivalent glucocorticoid. The use of aminoglutethimide has been largely superseded by ketoconazole, which can achieve a similar effect in decreasing circulating androgens but has been shown to be more effective in preventing tumor growth in clinical trials and is moderately less toxic. Aminoglutethimide, nonetheless, remains an alternative for patients who have either failed or are unable to tolerate ketoconazole, abiraterone, estrogens, or chemotherapy, and are not interested in a clinical trial. The side effects associated with aminoglutethimide are relatively mild and are usually limited to rashes, lethargy, somnolence, adrenal dysfunction, hypothyroidism, LFT and thyroid abnormalities, and occasional nausea and vomiting.</Para>

              <Heading>Ketoconazole</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Ketoconazole is a synthetic oral imidazole antifungal, first developed and marketed in the 1970s. Like all members of the imidazole antifungal class, it was designed to disrupt fungal cell membrane function via inhibition of the synthesis of ergosterol, a critical component of the fungal cell membrane. Ketoconazole specifically inhibits CYP51A (cytochrome P450 14a-demethylase), an enzyme which catalyzes ergosterol synthesis from lanosterol. The net effect of ketoconazole in the fungal cell is depletion of ergosterol from the membrane, leading to altered membrane fluidity, altered signaling, increased permeability, and inhibition of growth and replication [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24_8">24</CitationRef>]. Of all the imidazole antifungals, ketoconazole has the highest affinity for mammalian cytochrome p450 enzymes. Thus, humans taking ketoconazole experience inhibition of CYP51A and, with varying degrees of potency, CYP11A1, CYP11B1, CYP11B2, CYP17, and CYP19, leading to a marked decrease in adrenal functioning [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25_8">25</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The use of ketoconazole impairs the adrenal gland’s ability to synthesize adequate levels of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and androgens. This relatively toxic side effect was recognized early and spurred the development of newer imidazole antifungals (fluconazole, itraconazole) with less affinity for mammalian cytochrome p450 enzymes. This same mechanism has been exploited, however, as a means to decrease circulating androgens in patients with CRPC.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Recent studies have shown that ketoconazole clearly has activity in CRPC. In a pilot study, 20 patients with progressive disease despite combined androgen blockade were treated with ketoconazole 400 mg TID orally and hydrocortisone while undergoing AAWD. Eleven of these patients (55%) experienced a &gt;50% decrease in PSA, with a median duration of response of 8.5 months [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26_8">26</CitationRef>]. When studied after AAWD, high-dose ketoconazole resulted in a PSA decrease of &gt;50% in 30 of 48 (62.5%) evaluable patients. In this study, 48% of patients exhibited a &gt;80% decrease in PSA [<CitationRef CitationID="CR27_8">27</CitationRef>]. Low-dose ketoconazole (200 mg tid orally) was subsequently studied prospectively in 28 patients. This dose was found to be well tolerated, and a PSA decrease of &gt;50% was seen in 46% of patients. The median time of response based on PSA values was &gt;30 weeks. At the time of progression, 16 patients were subsequently treated with high-dose (400 mg tid orally) ketoconazole, but there was no patient response [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28_8">28</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Based on the results of previous studies, a randomized phase III trial of AAWD alone or in combination with high-dose ketoconazole, with replacement doses of hydrocortisone, was undertaken and reported in 2004 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29_8">29</CitationRef>]. In this study, the proportion of PSA response in those who underwent AAWD alone was 10% compared to 32% in the combination arm (<Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis> &lt; 0.001). Fourteen percent of patients treated with ketoconazole and AAWD experienced objective responses compared with 7% of subjects who underwent AAWD alone. Because of the high proportion of patients randomized to AAWD who ultimately crossed over to therapy with ketoconazole, an overall survival difference was not detected in this study. Nevertheless, a critical observation that emerged from this study was that patients who had experienced a 50% decline in PSA while on ketoconazole showed a survival of 41 months, compared to 13 months in those who had not (p&lt;0.001). Similarly, subsequent analysis showed that patients with high baseline circulating androstenedione levels are more likely to benefit from therapy with ketoconazole than patients with low circulating androstenedione levels, leading to the hypothesis that potential responders could be prospectively identified by determination of baseline circulating androgen levels. A similar observation from this study is that most patients who develop sustained responses to ketoconazole have “early” PSA declines within 3 months of initiating therapy, giving physicians a rationale for discontinuing therapy if no PSA response is seen at 3 months [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30_8">30</CitationRef>]. Taken together, these data suggest that ketoconazole is an active drug in a substantial proportion of patients with progressive disease on an anti-androgen and may be considered an acceptable secondary hormonal agent in this clinical context.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Ketoconazole is dosed at 400 mg orally three times a day and is given with replacement hydrocortisone, usually 5-10 mg orally twice a day. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and elevations in hepatic transammonases; other side effects include rash/pruritis, impotence, photosensitivity, breast tenderness or enlargement, or headache. Close attention should be paid to possible drug-drug interactions, as well as to the development of adrenal insufficiency even with corticosteroid replacement; stress-dose steroids should be considered in the event of serious illness.</Para>

              <Heading>Abiraterone Acetate</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The development of a novel targeted androgen synthesis inhibitor, abiraterone acetate, has renewed interest in using secondary hormonal agents in the management of CRPC. Abiraterone acetate is an orally available prodrug of abiraterone, an inhibitor of CYP17 (17alpha-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase). In contrast to the nonselective nature of ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate was developed as a highly selective, highly potent, irreversible inhibitor of CYP17, an enzyme that catalyzes key steps in the synthetic pathway of adrenal androgens (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">8.1</InternalRef>). Preclinical animal studies of abiraterone acetate showed significant reduction in testosterone levels, as well as reductions in prostate, seminal vesicle, and testicular size. Phase I testing has shown that abiraterone acetate suppresses testosterone and DHEA-S levels, and causes increases in plasma ACTH, 11-deoxycorticosterone, and corticosterone, consistent with upregulation of “upstream” signals.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The effect of abiraterone acetate on PSA was evident in the Phase I testing in the United States, with a &gt;50% decline in PSA after 3 months occurring in 12 of 25 patients completing the initial 28 days of treatment [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31_8">31</CitationRef>]. Additionally, seven of the 16 patients who had received prior ketoconazole showed a &gt;50% PSA response. A similar trial in the United Kingdom showed a &gt;50% decline in PSA in 57% of men, with five out of eight patients with measurable disease at the outset of therapy experiencing partial tumor shrinkage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32_8">32</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A Phase II study conducted in the UK showed that 60% of chemotherapy-naïve men with CRPC experienced a &gt;50% decline in PSA, and eight out of 15 men with bone metastases experienced a partial response [<CitationRef CitationID="CR33_8">33</CitationRef>]. Median time to progression (TTP) was approximately 8 months. Addition of dexamethasone 0.5 mg daily suppressed ACTH and reversed resistance in six out of 18 patients. Another Phase II trial using abiraterone acetate for patients with CRPC and progression after docetaxel-based chemotherapy confirmed many of the Phase I findings [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34_8">34</CitationRef>]. In this study, 41% of patients experienced &gt;50% decline in PSA from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment. Additionally, 24% experienced radiologic partial response or stable disease. This study serves as a proof of the principle that patients who experience disease progression despite docetaxel-based chemotherapy may continue to derive benefit from the additional androgen blockade, thus forming the basis for the ongoing Phase III studies.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The major side effects associated with abiraterone are due to inhibition of CYP17. This inhibition leads to a reduction in cortisol and androgen levels; however, it does not affect circulating mineralocorticoid levels (as CYP17 is not required for mineralocorticoid synthesis). The reduction in circulating corticosteroid levels caused by abiraterone leads to upregulation of ACTH secretion by the hypothalamic–pituitary axis. This, in turn, stimulates further mineralocorticoid synthesis; the major clinical effect of this excess mineralocorticoid secretion is hypertension and hypokalemia. The administration of low-dose corticosteroids can suppress ACTH secretion and improve hypertension in these patients. Anti-aldosterone agents such as spironolactone may be effective, as well, in treating the hypertension induced by abiraterone acetate; however, they are generally avoided as they may stimulate the AR [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32_8">32</CitationRef>]. Other common side effects of abiraterone include fatigue, transammonitis, anorexia, and edema. Partly due to the fact that replacement corticosteroids are given with abiraterone acetate, adrenal insufficiency is not commonly associated with abiraterone acetate use. Abiraterone acetate is dosed at 1,000 mg orally daily with prednisone 5 mg orally twice-daily in the current Phase III trials.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">While abiraterone acetate has shown much promise in early testing, the optimal timing or use of abiraterone among the many therapies that exist for prostate cancer has still not been established. Should it be used in combination with LHRH analogues? What is the efficacy of this agent in patients who have received prior therapy with ketoconazole? Should it be used by itself as a secondary hormonal agent? Should it be used before, after, or concurrently with chemotherapy? While a series of studies are underway to explore these questions, evidence indicates that patients who previously received either ketoconazole or DES therapy benefit from abiraterone acetate therapy, suggesting that the mechanism of action and resistance to these therapies may be nonoverlapping [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31_8">31</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Based on the evidence of activity in men who have previously received chemotherapy, a multicentered, multinational, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase III study is currently underway to evaluate abiraterone acetate in this setting. The primary endpoint of the study is overall survival. If positive, this study would be the first to demonstrate a true survival benefit to secondary hormonal therapy, though it may not address the issue of the optimal timing of the use of this agent. To test the efficacy of abiraterone before chemotherapy, a similar multicentered, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study is also underway in men with metastatic CRPC who have not yet received chemotherapy, with overall survival as the primary endpoint.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Estrogens are structurally related steroid hormones derived from androstenedione and testosterone; their synthesis is catalyzed by CYP19 (aromatase). While the majority of circulating estrogens in women are produced in the ovaries, in both sexes the adrenal gland has the ability produce estrone and estradiol either directly from androstenedione or from conversion from testosterone. Similarly, CYP19 can convert circulating precursors to estrogens in peripheral tissues.</Para>

Although phase III trials showed DES to be equivalent to orchiectomy as frontline therapy for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, its excessive cardiovascular and thromboembolic toxicity, as well as the advent of the less toxic GnRH/LHRH analogs, have made it an unacceptable first-line agent in prostate cancer.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In the advanced setting, DES has shown modest efficacy in several studies.

Median response duration in this trial was 3.8 months for DES with a median time to progression of 2.9 months. Response rates to DES have varied in other studies between 15 and 33%. Taken together, the data suggest that estrogen agonists have some activity in patients with CRPC, though there is no likelihood of a significant dose response effect with DES [<CitationRef CitationID="CR39_8">40</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Other synthetic estrogenic compounds such as the conjugated estrogens, ethinyl estradiol and chlorotrianisene have been evaluated in the treatment for CRPC; however, they have neither demonstrated significantly more activity nor shown significantly less toxicity, compared to DES. Recent testing has shown that transdermal estradiol administration can induce castrate levels of circulating testosterone and result in PSA responses; however, it is unclear at present whether this mode of administration will be more efficacious or less toxic than DES [<CitationRef CitationID="CR40_8">41</CitationRef>]. Estramustine, a synthetic estrogen conjugated to a nitrogen mustard, has little activity as a single agent but may have significant activity when combined with taxane-based chemotherapy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41_8">42</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Because of an association with vaginal clear cell carcinoma and other reproductive abnormalities in females exposed to DES in utero, DES is no longer directly marketed in the US but must be obtained through a dedicated pharmacy. When prescribed, it is usually given with low dose warfarin (2–3 mg orally per day) to mitigate the prothrombotic risk.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Side effects of all estrogens include increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, other cardiovascular events, nausea, vomiting, weight gain, and edema. There is clear evidence, however, that estrogens improve bone density, and thus these agents may be a reasonable choice for men with severe osteoporosis. Gynecomastia induced by estrogens may be decreased by prophylactic irradiation of the breasts.</Para>

              <Heading>Progestins</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Progestational agents such as megestrol and medroxyprogesterone acetate, while lacking the toxicity of the estrogens, have shown limited efficacy in prostate cancer. Megesterol acetate is thought to suppress LHRH, to lower testosterone, to block the conversion of testosterone to DHT, as well as to contribute to AR blockade. Only 10–15% of patients receiving megesterol in clinical studies have had &gt;50% PSA declines, with no observed differences between low dose (160 mg/day) and high-dose (640 mg/day) groups [<CitationRef CitationID="CR42_8">43</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR43_8">44</CitationRef>]. Despite this limited activity, the progestins may have a role in palliation of bony pain when corticosteroids are contraindicated.</Para>

            <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The inhibitors of adrenal androgen synthesis comprise a diverse group including corticosteroids, ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide, estrogenic and progestin compounds such as DES, megestrol, medroxyprogesterone acetate and more recently, abiraterone acetate, TAK-700, and TOK-001. The common thread linking these agents is their net effect on decreasing androgen synthesis by the adrenal glands. From large clinical studies, it is clear that secondary hormonal manipulations are effective at depriving CRPC of growth signals. More recent evidence has emerged that they can be effective even after tumors have developed resistance to chemotherapy. Of all the therapies discussed here, abiraterone acetate is the most promising new adrenolytic agent, and the results of the current phase III studies are eagerly anticipated. Continued research will help to develop novel hormonal strategies to slow the growth of advanced prostate cancer.</Para>
