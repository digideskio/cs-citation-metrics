              <Para>The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of the previous Australian government’s carbon pricing mechanism (CPM) on wholesale electricity spot prices. Australia’s emissions per unit of GDP are about twice the level of the OECD (IEA <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2010</CitationRef>) mainly due to low fossil fuel energy prices. Stationary energy in Australia is the largest source of CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> at around half of total emissions (Treasury <CitationRef CitationID="CR55">2011</CitationRef>), of which more than two-thirds come from electricity generation (i.e., electricity generation accounts for 35 % of all CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> emissions in Australia). Thus, the climate change plan was introduced by the previous government as part of its clean energy future policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 5 % below 2000 levels by 2020, and to 80 % below 2000 levels by 2050.<Footnote ID="Fn1">
                  <Para>The CPM, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and action on the land were the four key elements of the plan. Since the CPM was seen as the core of the climate change plan, this paper concentrates on the particular impact of the CPM, while the other three key elements are left for future research.</Para>
                </Footnote> The CPM was central to the plan; its aim was to incentivize Australia’s largest emitters to enhance energy efficiency and invest in sustainable energy. Under the CPM, businesses emitting over 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO<Subscript>2</Subscript>e) emissions annually were required to purchase emissions units from the government (Clean Energy Regulator <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2013</CitationRef>). The CPM became effective on the first of July 2012, with an introductory phase during which the price of uncapped permits was fixed (starting at $23 per tonne of CO<Subscript>2</Subscript>e and increasing to $25.40/tCO<Subscript>2</Subscript>e) with a planned transition to an emissions trading scheme (ETS) in July 2015.<Footnote ID="Fn2">
                  <Para>The annual caps for the first 5 years of the ETS flexible price period were to be announced by 31 May 2014, with the price determined by the market. Besides domestic reductions through the ETS for energy-intensive sectors, the plan had also considered emission reductions abroad by linking to the European emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) and the Kyoto flexible mechanisms as key tools to increase the cost-effectiveness of fulfilling its obligations. These links would allow Australian firms covered by the ETS to meet up to 12.5 % of their liabilities using Kyoto units, and up to 50 % of their liabilities using European allowances (EUAs) to ensure significant domestic reductions. Moreover, the price ceiling as a safeguard was planned to be set at $20 above the expected EUA for 2015–2016 and set to rise by 5 % in real terms in 2017 and 2018. However, the new Liberal-National coalition government repealed the carbon tax on 17 July 2014 and plans to commence implementation of its Direct Action Plan (DAP). The DAP will build on the Carbon Farming Initiative and includes an Emissions Reduction Fund (Clean Energy Regulator <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2013</CitationRef>). At the time of writing, detailed information on this plan is not yet available, but will eventually be accessible at <ExternalRef>

                </Footnote>
                     </Para>
              <Para>In the confines of the Australian wholesale electricity market, the intention behind imposing a price on carbon was to encourage producers to switch away from coal-fired generation and move to gas and renewable sources of energy through increasing the costs of fossil fuel combustion.<Footnote ID="Fn3">
                  <Para>Approximately, 85 % of Australia’s electricity consumption is fuelled by coal-fired electricity generation with the emission intensity of 1. Gas-fired plants account for around 8 % of electricity generated, while less than 6 % of output is from hydroelectric generation (ABARES <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2011b</CitationRef>).</Para>
                </Footnote> However, the coincidence of increases in power prices with the implementation of the CPM in Australia has raised the question as to whether electricity generators have already passed through the costs of carbon to wholesale electricity prices. Seeking an answer to this question could help to reveal the effectiveness of the CPM policy in encouraging the substitution of current methods of power generation with low carbon-intensive technologies. According to existing statistics, power prices within the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) increased significantly after July 2012 (the implementation of the CPM). For instance, the average annual wholesale electricity spot price increased from $29.77 per megawatt hour (MWh) in the 2012 financial year, to around $60/MWh in 2013.<Footnote ID="Fn4">
                  <Para>In Australia the financial year starts on 1 July and ends on 30 June of the following year. For example, the 2013 financial year started on 1 July 2012 and ended on 30 June 2013.</Para>
                </Footnote> For some states, the increases in prices have been very significant. For example, in Queensland, wholesale electricity spot prices increased from $29/MWh in 2012 to $67/MWh in 2013; in the same year, South Australian prices increased by 130 % to around $68/MWh.</Para>
              <Para>Therefore, the research question this paper asks is: to what extent can the increase in wholesale electricity spot prices be attributed to the pass-through of the costs of carbon on to consumers through higher prices [the so-called “carbon costs pass-through rate” (CPTR)]? In this paper, the concept of carbon pass-through refers to terminology in Sijm et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">2006</CitationRef>) and Chen et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2008</CitationRef>); defined as the ratio of changes in the price of power to the changes in marginal costs due to the implementation of the CPM.<Footnote ID="Fn5">
                  <Para>Various definitions of the pass-through rate have been proposed in several studies [see, for example, Kate et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2005</CitationRef>) and Stennek and Verboven (<CitationRef CitationID="CR53">2001</CitationRef>)].</Para>
                </Footnote> Similarly, Nelson et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2010b</CitationRef>) and Wild et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR57">2012</CitationRef>) define the carbon pass-through as the proportion of carbon prices that are passed through to electricity prices. The hypothesis of this paper is that carbon costs are passed on fully to wholesale electricity spot prices within the NEM.</Para>
              <Para>The issue of interdependence between carbon and electricity prices is examined in several papers.<Footnote ID="Fn6">
                  <Para>See, for example, Frontier Economics (<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">2006</CitationRef>); Reinaud (<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">2007</CitationRef>); Sijm et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2008</CitationRef>); Chen et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2008</CitationRef>); Fell (<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2008</CitationRef>); Fezzi and Bunn (<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">2009</CitationRef>); Frontier Economics (<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2010</CitationRef>); Nazifi and Milunovich (<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2010</CitationRef>); Lise et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">2010</CitationRef>); Trueck and Cotton (<CitationRef CitationID="CR56">2011</CitationRef>); Fabra and Reguant (<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
                </Footnote> Although there appears to be sufficient evidence to conclude that carbon prices affect electricity futures prices, there is much less empirical support for the hypothesis that the carbon price has a significant impact on electricity spot prices. Thus, the contribution of this paper is to measure the actual impact of the CPM on electricity spot prices in Australia by statistically estimating the CPTRs using econometric evidence from the NEM during the period July 2010 to October 2013. In contrast to the very few existing studies in Australia that address a similar issue using simulation analysis,<Footnote ID="Fn7">
                  <Para>See, for example, ROAM Consulting (<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2008</CitationRef>); McLennan Magasanik Associates (<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">2008</CitationRef>); Simshauser (<CitationRef CitationID="CR49">2008</CitationRef>); Simshauser and Doan (<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">2009</CitationRef>); Nelson et al (<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">2010a</CitationRef>); Wild et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR57">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
                </Footnote> the paper adopts an empirical approach and a “let the data speak for itself” modelling philosophy to statistically test its hypothesis. The empirical investigation employs a sequence of econometric tests including unit root tests and Granger causality tests to examine short-run links between carbon prices and electricity and energy prices. Regression analyses are also used to statistically estimate the carbon pass-through rates. To the best of my knowledge, this paper is a pioneer empirical study on carbon costs pass-through rates to wholesale electricity spot prices across the NEM. As such, this study undertakes one of the first evaluations of the CPM and fills a vital research gap around design issues in environmental markets in Australia.</Para>
              <Para>The findings could be crucial for policy-makers when assessing the CPM’s performance and its impacts on industry and households. Estimating the CPTRs determines the incidence of the carbon cost, while having the foresight to cost the incidence addresses the consequences of a carbon price on the key participants within the NEM in their attempts to curb the growth of carbon emissions. A higher rate of CPTR is indicative of consumers bearing a large proportion of the tax, while a lower rate shows that the tax incidence would be internally absorbed to a significant extent by generators, subsequently altering the marginal cost relativities, changing the competitive landscape and potentially further encouraging the use of carbon-efficient technologies.<Footnote ID="Fn8">
                  <Para>It is worth mentioning that relative fuel price change or price signal is only one of a number of elements that could enhance the competitiveness of low carbon technologies to generate electricity. Any discussion of a technological shift would need to take into consideration many other factors that may influence switching activity, such as the variability in plant efficiency, technical factors, environmental regulations and policies (for instance, the Renewable Energy Target scheme) and other specificities of the power market, to fully investigate this change and the extent to which each of these factors is likely to contribute to this shift (IEA <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">2013</CitationRef>). The current paper statistically measures the carbon costs pass-through rates to see if the CPM could further incentivise generators to switch to carbon-efficient technologies and thereby assess the CPM’s likely effectiveness in terms of its contribution to lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The present analysis applies daily observations for the volume-weighted average emission intensity for each state to calculate the costs of the carbon required to generate one MWh of electricity to estimate the CPTRs. However, to analyse precisely whether this technological shift has occurred, further analysis based on average intensity data is needed. According to existing statistics, after the introduction of the CPM, the emission of CO2 from electricity within the NEM fell (by approximately 7.7 %); however, several studies have reported that this reduction can be mainly attributed to the factors unrelated to the carbon tax [see, for detailed information, Frontier Economics (<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2013</CitationRef>) and Quarterly Update of Australia’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (<CitationRef CitationID="CR42">2013</CitationRef>)]. For example, the shutdown of a substantial amount of brown coal generation in Victoria due to a mine flood has led to a significant reduction in CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> emissions in this sector (Frontier Economics <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2013</CitationRef>). Furthermore, the Energy Users Association of Australia (EUAA) has reported that no evidence could be found to support the claim that the CPM has lowered emissions in stationary energy to any meaningful extent (EUAA <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
                </Footnote> By assessing the need, the scope and the role of industry assistance plans, including the partial or complete allocation of free permits, this paper will support policy-makers to make better-informed regulatory decisions when designing the Direct Action Plan and the Emissions Reduction Fund to combat climate change.<Footnote ID="Fn9">
                  <Para>Under the previous government, the Clean Energy Regulator was set up to provide financial assistance to the affected coal-fired electricity generators (industry assistance programs) in adjusting to the carbon price as compensation for the introduction of the CPM. There were three types of assistance: (1) the issue of 41.705 million free carbon units each year from 2013 to 2017; (2) $1 billion of cash payments distributed to eligible generators in June 2012; and (3) financial support to close highly emissions-intensive power stations. All coal-fired generators with an emissions intensity greater than 1 that supplied electricity to a main grid during the period 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2010 were eligible for assistance. However, under the new government, the Emissions Reduction Fund is the centrepiece of the Direct Action Plan, intending to purchase low-cost abatement through reverse auctions.</Para>
                </Footnote>
                     </Para>
              <Para>The analysis indicates that the incidence of taxation would apparently be borne by consumers rather than generators. The extent of the estimated CPTRs for all states considered in this study reveal that the implementation of the CPM could lead to carbon-induced profit effects (so-called “windfall profits”)<Footnote ID="Fn10">
                  <Para>While the conventional meaning of “windfall profits” refers to just the value of economic rent derived from some fixed asset such as free allowances, in this paper, in the context of a CPM and the power sector, the term “windfall profits” broadly refers to the changes in the profits of existing power generators due to carbon-induced changes in power prices, production costs and sales volumes (Chen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2008</CitationRef>). For instance, if the power price is set by a coal-fired plant, given that the cost of carbon is fully passed to the power price (while sales volumes do not change), some generators may benefit from the implementation of the CPM (depending on the fuel generation mix of their installations) as the increase in their revenue may exceed the increase in their costs. Furthermore, the availability of financial assistance to electricity generators under the industry assistance programs (such as the provision of the free allocation of carbon units to eligible generators by the Australian government as discussed above) could increase the potential for windfall gains by generators.</Para>
                </Footnote> for some generators.<Footnote ID="Fn11">
                  <Para>However, it is important to note that in this paper, due to the assumption of a fixed efficiency rate, changes in power prices cannot be attributed to changes in technology which could result in over/underestimation of CPTRs (a detailed discussion on this point can be found in Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec8">4</InternalRef>). The impact of the CPM on possible technological changes in generating electricity is left for future research.</Para>
                </Footnote> These findings corroborate those of Wild et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR57">2012</CitationRef>) and Nelson et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2010b</CitationRef>) who find by using simulation analysis that carbon prices impact wholesale electricity spot prices significantly. However, their findings also show relatively low levels of carbon pass-through. For instance, the results produced in Nelson et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2010b</CitationRef>) revealed that the average carbon pass-through rate on wholesale electricity prices was around 0.95. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that an empirical method is employed in this paper to estimate the pass-through rates, while previous studies have applied simulation analysis. Another explanation is that this paper statistically estimates the pass-through rates for all five states within the NEM separately rather than estimating the average rate for Australia. Moreover, a proportion of this difference can be attributed to the use of a different dataset as well as different time periods.</Para>
              <Para>The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section <InternalRef RefID="Sec2">2</InternalRef> provides a summary of some of the rules that govern the electricity market in Australia. It also provides a brief review of the existing studies that address the carbon pass-through rates.

                <Para>Australia’s electricity generation sector can be broken down into three markets: the National Electricity Market (NEM), which operates in the eastern states; the Wholesale Electricity Market, which operates in Western Australia; and an integrated electricity utility, which services the Northern Territory. The NEM began operating as a wholesale spot market in December 1998 and is the world’s longest interconnected power system. The operation is based on five regions: New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD), South Australia (SA), Victoria (VIC) and Tasmania (TAS). The link between electricity producers and electricity consumers is established through a pool that is used to aggregate the output from all generators to meet forecasted demand. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) manages the NEM and aims to provide an effective infrastructure for the efficient operation of the spot market. The NEM’s transmission network carries power from generators to primarily local electricity distributors across the five states. Most consumers do not participate directly in the NEM; they purchase their electricity through retailers. According to existing statistics, in 2013, the average annual value of electricity traded in the NEM was about $11.4 billion to meet the demand of more than nine million customers (AEMO <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2013c</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para>The wholesale market of the NEM is a real-time energy market where a centrally coordinated dispatch process is used to match demand and supply instantaneously in real time. Generators offer to supply the market with specific amounts of electricity at particular prices every five minutes. Supply bids are stacked from the least price to the highest price and the dispatch price for each 5-min interval is set equal to the last bid needed to meet demand at a given period. There is a market price cap of $13,100/MWh (at January 2014). If it is not possible or too costly for generators to switch off their supply during the off-peak period, they might offer negative bids to ensure that they get scheduled to supply. However, there is a limit on the minimum spot price set at -$1,000/MWh (AEMO <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2013c</CitationRef>). Since the market is settled at a 30-min period, the wholesale spot price is calculated every 30 min as the average of the dispatch prices for the six 5-min intervals that make up the period. The spot price is used as the basis for the settlement of financial transactions for all energy traded in the NEM. The wholesale costs account for around 20 % of the retail accounts, and additional charges are added to the price paid by domestic and business consumers for electricity, which includes network costs, service fees, market and other retail charges (AEMO <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2013b</CitationRef>).<Footnote ID="Fn12">
                    <Para>Over the past three years, the national average residential retail electricity price has risen by approximately 78 % (AEMC <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2013</CitationRef>). However, it would not be appropriate to attribute this increase in prices merely to the implementation of the CPM. Australian retail prices are affected (in addition to wholesale electricity prices) by a number of factors such as network costs (including transmission and distribution costs), capital costs, electricity demand, regulation of network businesses, and environmental policies. Any analysis on retail prices would need to take into account these factors and the extent to which each of these major drivers will actually translate into retail prices. Currently, network costs make up approximately 52 % of the national average retail electricity prices, and increases in network costs have significantly contributed to higher retail prices (AEMC <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2013</CitationRef>). However, the assessment of the carbon costs pass-through rate in this analysis is based on modelling the wholesale electricity spot prices due to the availability of daily data, while the impact of the CPM on the retail electricity market is left for future research.</Para>

                <Para>Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef> shows the evolution of wholesale electricity prices within the NEM. As is evident from the graph, spot prices tend to be severely event-driven and show extreme levels of volatility. There may be a significant number of events that are weather-related, demand-related, and/or equipment failure-related that influence the price on spot markets for electricity prices. For example, QLD’s high prices in early 2013 could be partly attributed to some price spikes that occurred in January 2013 due to the extremely hot weather at the time (AEMO <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2013b</CitationRef>).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

                <Para>Despite some price spikes that occurred in early 2011, the NEM wholesale spot prices averaged around $29 during the 2011 financial year. Electricity prices fluctuated around $30 over July 2011–June 2012. However, as can be seen in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>, they increased significantly in July 2012 to above $70. The increase in volume-weighted average monthly prices across the five NEM regions ranged from $30 to around $53 over June 2012–July 2012. For instance, in NSW, the volume-weighted average monthly prices increased from $36 in June 2012 to around $68 in July 2012. The wholesale electricity prices in QLD increased by more than 84 % to $65 in July 2012. South Australia (SA) experienced a significant increase in average monthly prices by around $53 from June 2012 to July 2012, while in Tasmania they increased from $35 to approximately $60 over the same period. In Victoria, the electricity price increased by more than $38; from $37.75 in June 2012 to about $76 in July 2012. The average annual price for the NEM continued to increase during the 2013 financial year to around $60, from $29.77 in the previous year. As mentioned earlier, QLD experienced some price spikes in January 2013 due to weather-related events. SA also had the tightest supply conditions in the region in May 2013 and June 2013 leading to high spot price outcomes for this time of the year (AEMO 2013d). As can be seen from Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>, over the period from July 2013 to October 2013, the NEM wholesale spot prices averaged around $56.34.</Para>
                <Para>As mentioned earlier, the coincidence of the increase in electricity prices with the implementation of the CPM has raised concerns that these increases in prices, in addition to other factors, may be mainly due to the carbon price because of the pass-through to consumers of the costs of carbon permits through higher wholesale electricity prices. In this regard, different changes in electricity prices across the NEM (in addition to some factors such as different market structures,<Footnote ID="Fn13">
                    <Para>According to Sijm et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR48">2012</CitationRef>), this market structure refers primarily to the interaction among the number of firms (as an indicator of the level of market competitiveness or market concentration), the shape of the demand curve, and the shape of the supply curve.</Para>
                  </Footnote> different demand and supply elasticities, and the availability of low carbon-intensive substitutes for generators) could be primarily attributed to variations in emission intensities across states. Therefore, this paper considers emission intensities in an effort to measure the impact of the carbon price on electricity prices.</Para>
                <Para>The NEM-weighted average emissions intensity is approximately 0.94 tCO<Subscript>2</Subscript>/MWh (ABARES <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2011a</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">b</CitationRef>);<Footnote ID="Fn14">
                    <Para>The average emission intensity in Europe is around 0.35; in the US is 0.54; and in Canada about 0.18 tCO<Subscript>2</Subscript>/MWh.</Para>
                  </Footnote> however, emission intensities vary significantly across the NEM. For instance, Victoria has the highest emission intensity of about 1.18 tCO<Subscript>2</Subscript>/MWh, reflecting the relatively high concentration of brown coal-fired generation; while Tasmania has the lowest rate of around 0.06 tCO<Subscript>2</Subscript>/MWh due to the predominance of hydro plants in that state (AEMO <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2013a</CitationRef>). According to the Treasury model, the CPM was expected to reduce the average emission intensity of the electricity sector by 77 % over the period to 2050 and result in a cumulative reduction in pollution from this sector of almost 500 MtCO<Subscript>2</Subscript>e by 2030 (Treasury <CitationRef CitationID="CR55">2011</CitationRef>). Emissions reduction in the power sector was expected to occur mainly through switching from the dominant coal-fired electricity generation to existing lower-emission alternatives (natural gas or renewable energy) due to the rising cost of generating electricity by coal. However, the displacement of coal by existing renewable or gas generators depends on a number of factors, such as the price of natural gas, the availability of renewable energy sources and, most importantly, carbon costs pass-through rate (CPTR). The significant levels of the CPTRs indicate that the incremental increases in revenue associated with the carbon price-induced increases in wholesale electricity prices will be enough to offset the incremental increases in variable costs associated with the imposition of the carbon price. In this case, carbon costs are unlikely to be borne by generators. In contrast, low levels of CPTRs are indicative of generators that are bearing a higher proportion of the incidence of carbon costs, which could result in the current methods being replaced by more carbon-efficient technologies (in addition to other factors that may affect this replacement).</Para>
                <Para>The degree of carbon pass-through rates are influenced by a range of factors, such as electricity supply and demand elasticities, market structure, the emissions intensity of existing capital stocks, availability of low carbon-emission substitutes and technologies, changes in the merit order,<Footnote ID="Fn15">
                    <Para>In the power sector, with multiple generators having fixed capacities and different carbon intensity factors, generators can be ranked in ascending order of their short-run marginal costs, known as merit order. So generators with the lowest marginal costs are the first ones to meet demand, and plants with the highest marginal costs are among the last to be brought on line to meet demand.</Para>

                  </Footnote> For example, Linares et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">2006</CitationRef>), and Kara et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">2008</CitationRef>) simulate the effects of carbon regulation on the electricity sector. Their findings show that carbon trading has increased electricity prices in Spain and across all Nordic countries, respectively. Sijm et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">2006</CitationRef>) report that between 60 and 100 % of the carbon price is passed through to electricity prices in Germany and the Netherlands. This pass-through is generally viewed as a windfall profit to the electricity industry under the free permit allocation system. Reinaud (<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">2007</CitationRef>) investigates the links between EUAs and electricity prices. Her findings show a complete pass-through of EUA costs to electricity prices. Fezzi and Bunn (<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">2009</CitationRef>) and Nazifi and Milunovich (<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2010</CitationRef>) conducted empirical studies of linkages between carbon permit prices and energy sources. While the former finds a statistically significant relationship between the prices of carbon permits and electricity, the latter do not find any long-term relationship between them. Zachmann and von Hirschhausen (<CitationRef CitationID="CR58">2008</CitationRef>) estimate asymmetric effects of carbon pricing on electricity prices in Germany, while Fell (<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2008</CitationRef>) and Chemarin et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">2008</CitationRef>) also examine linkages between electricity and carbon prices across several Nordic countries and France, respectively. Chemarin et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">2008</CitationRef>) find no short-run links between electricity and carbon prices, and conclude that these two markets are not integrated. On the other hand, Fell (<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2008</CitationRef>) shows that carbon prices affect the price of electricity in the short run. Gronwald et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2011</CitationRef>) extend these findings by investigating the relationship between returns of EU ETS carbon futures and electricity future prices, and find a strong relationship between them. Such a variety of outcomes results mainly from differences in the data and the methodologies used, as well as from differing definitions of the pass-through rate or the regression variables considered.</Para>
                <Para>The effects of the carbon price on electricity prices in Australia have been studied in very few papers. The studies that have been done mainly use theoretical and simulation analyses and arrive at different results based on different assumptions and approaches to modelling the issue.<Footnote ID="Fn17">
                    <Para>See, for example, McLennan Magasanik Associates (<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">2006</CitationRef>); Simshauser and Doan (<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">2009</CitationRef>); Nelson et al.

                  </Footnote> For instance, Nelson et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2010b</CitationRef>) suggest that the key driver of the carbon pass-through is likely to be the average intensity of electricity generation, around 0.94. The CPTR is estimated at around 128 % in the Garnaut Report (<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2008</CitationRef>) using a multi-area probabilistic dispatch algorithm. The highest pass-through rate of 393 % is estimated by Simshauser et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR51">2007</CitationRef>). Wild et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR57">2012</CitationRef>) investigate the impact of the carbon price on electricity prices by an agent-based model of the Australian NEM. They find that the carbon cost is not completely passed through to consumers. The Treasury report (2011) identifies the impacts of the carbon tax on electricity prices through a set of simulations and shows that average wholesale electricity prices could go up by around $18 per MWh over the first 5 years of the CPM.</Para>
                <Para>The current literature suggests mixed results on the relationship between carbon and electricity spot prices and a significant variation in the estimation of CPTR, ranging from 17 % (McLennan Magasanik Associates <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">2006</CitationRef>), 100 % (ROAM Consulting <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2008</CitationRef>), and up to more than 393 % (Simshauser and Doan <CitationRef CitationID="CR50">2009</CitationRef>), providing some conflicting and inconclusive evidence, and showing that there is scope for more studies on the topic. Thus, the relative scarcity in economics literature is the motivation for undertaking this study. This article extends the existing literature by providing some new insights into the issue of interdependency and dynamic interactions between carbon and electricity prices.</Para>

              <Para>To empirically assess whether and to what extent changes in electricity prices can be attributed to the pass-through of carbon costs, this study considers other key factors impacting wholesale electricity spot prices (in addition to carbon prices) such as the price of coal, natural gas prices and demand for electricity over the July 2010–October 2013 period. The dataset is constructed on a monthly basis from various sources. For instance, the price of coal is Australian thermal coal, obtained from IndexMundi.<Footnote ID="Fn18">
                  <Para>IndexMundi is a data portal that gathers facts and statistics from multiple sources (more information can be found at: <ExternalRef>

                </Footnote> The price of natural gas is the short-term trading market, obtained from the AEMO for each regional market individually. The dataset also consists of half-hourly price observations for wholesale electricity spot prices as well as the carbon costs for all five states within the NEM: NSW, QLD, SA, TAS and VIC. It also considers the daily observations for average emission intensity of the electricity sector within the NEM for each state individually, and half-hourly data on electricity demand for each regional market separately. To account for major differences in power demand and hence different prices for electricity during a day,<Footnote ID="Fn19">
                  <Para>The AEMO’s definition of peak hours per day is the period between 07:00 and 22:00 EST.</Para>
                </Footnote> the volume-weighted average price for the electricity spot market is used in the current analysis. These prices are calculated based on real-time trading (30 min) data for price and demand for each regional market individually, obtained from the AEMO. To capture and statistically evaluate the potential impacts of the carbon price on electricity prices, a dummy variable is created which is equal to 1 from July 2012 (when the CPM became effective) to October 2013, and 0 otherwise. Over the period investigated, the carbon prices were fixed at A$23/tCO<Subscript>2</Subscript> and at A$24.15/tCO<Subscript>2</Subscript> for the 2012 and the 2013 financial years, respectively.</Para>
              <Para>To examine the dynamic interaction among electricity, fossil fuel and carbon markets, all prices are transformed and expressed in A$/MWh by the daily observations for volume-weighted emission intensities, the standard energy conversion, energy densities and thermodynamic efficiency rates.<Footnote ID="Fn20">
                  <Para>Following the 2012 IEA report, in this study, the standard generic efficiency rates of 35 and 40 % are assumed for coal-fired and natural gas-fired generation, respectively, regardless of the state in which these technologies operate (IEA <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">2012</CitationRef>). Furthermore, Sijm et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2008</CitationRef>) use the same rates to analyse the interaction between power, fuel and carbon markets.</Para>
                </Footnote> For instance, the price of carbon is converted and expressed in A$/MWh by daily observations for the volume-weighted average emission intensity of each state. In this case, the price of carbon is not fixed anymore because this variable now shows the costs of the carbon units that are required to cover the CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> emissions of generating 1 MWh of electricity. To assess the potential impact of a CPM on electricity spot prices, following Sijm et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2008</CitationRef>) and Chen et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2008</CitationRef>), it is assumed that fuel costs are fully and directly passed on to wholesale electricity prices. Therefore, based on this assumption, fuel prices have been subtracted from power prices, resulting in the so-called “spread”. For the present analysis, a “spread” is simply defined as the difference between the volume-weighted average wholesale electricity spot price and the cost of fuel (coal or gas) to generate 1 MWh of electricity (detailed discussion can be found in Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec9">4.1</InternalRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Unit root tests</Heading>
                <Para>This paper continues the analysis in three stages to formally examine the interaction between electricity and carbon prices. In the first stage of analysis, sequences of econometric methods that test the order of integration of all series are employed. More specifically, the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) (Dickey and Fuller <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">1979</CitationRef>; Said and Dickey <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">1984</CitationRef>) and the Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">1992</CitationRef>) tests are chosen for investigating the integration properties of the series. The ADF specification tests the null hypothesis of unit root, while the KPSS test specifies the null that series are stationary. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef> reports the results of the unit root tests. In addition, for the sake of completeness of the analysis, the Saikkonen and Lütkepohl (<CitationRef CitationID="CR45">2002</CitationRef>) approach for testing the unit root with structural break is also applied. These tests allow examination of the unit root properties of the time series, while dealing with the possibility of shifts in the levels of time series by simultaneously detecting endogenous structural breaks for each variable. No structural break could be detected for the investigated time series.<Footnote ID="Fn21">
                    <Para>The results of unit root tests with structural breaks do not change significantly by allowing for a break in either intercept or trend and are in favour of no breaks in series, and hence not reported. The findings are available upon request.</Para>

                <Para>The findings shown in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef> support the conclusion that all price series (except coal prices) may be treated as <Emphasis Type="Italic">I</Emphasis>(0), integrated of order zero.<Footnote ID="Fn22">
                    <Para>However, it should be emphasised that in finite samples, the unit root test procedures are known to have limited power against alternative hypotheses and this problem is particularly severe for small samples (see Campbell and Perron <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">1991</CitationRef>). Thus, these results should be used with caution.</Para>
                  </Footnote> The second stage is to conduct a Granger causality test to investigate the relationships as discussed above, and to test for causality between the carbon price and the prices of electricity, coal and natural gas across states. Given the results from Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef>, the analysis proceeds to conduct Granger causality tests on the level of prices.</Para>

                <Para>In this section, Granger causality tests are used to assess the extent of temporal causality between energy prices to determine whether there is any statistically significant impact running from carbon prices to energy prices and more specifically to electricity prices. To test for Granger causality, the econometric specification is a vector auto regression as follows:<Equation ID="Equ1">

                <Para>According to the above table, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis> values for the null hypothesis of no Granger causality running from carbon prices to electricity prices are less than 10 % indicating that the hypothesis is rejected.<Footnote ID="Fn23">
                    <Para>It should be noted that small samples could lead to questions about the statistical reliability of results produced by Granger causality tests. Dolado and Lütkepohl (<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">1996</CitationRef>) found that in high dimensional (integrated–cointegrated) VAR systems with a small true lag length, the significant reduction of power of the Granger causality test may occur, especially for small samples. In this case, the assumption of standard asymptotic distribution may often cause significant over-rejection. Application of the residual-based bootstrap techniques usually improves the power performance of causality tests. They have also shown that standard asymptotic properties of the Wald test can be ensured by overfitting a VAR process whose order exceeds the true order, as pointed out by Toda and Yamamoto (<CitationRef CitationID="CR54">1995</CitationRef>). In this paper, the Granger causality test has also been conducted by overfitting a VAR in levels. The results are similar in sign and statistical significance and hence not reported. They are available upon request.</Para>
                  </Footnote> Therefore, there is some evidence of Granger causality running from the carbon prices to the electricity prices in all five states at 10 percent significance level. This finding is consistent with statistically significant links found between these two variables in previous studies for the EU discussed in Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec4">2.2</InternalRef>. However, no evidence has been found for a converse relationship, with causality running from the price of electricity to the price of carbon in any of the 5 states, at any conventional level of significance. This finding was expected because of fixed carbon prices during the introductory phase of the CPM.</Para>
                <Para>Further, there is some weak evidence, at 10 % significance, of Granger causality running from carbon prices to coal prices in NSW, QLD and VIC. However, no evidence has been found regarding the effect of the carbon price on the price of natural gas. One possible explanation for the findings of no significant or strong links between carbon and energy prices is that natural gas and coal prices are determined in global, liquid markets and are thereby influenced by factors other than Australian carbon prices. According to Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">2</InternalRef>, there is strong evidence of Granger causality running from coal and natural gas prices to electricity prices.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab2">

                <Para>Given that there is empirical evidence of Granger causality running from carbon prices to electricity prices, the next matter of interest is to statistically measure these impacts. Thus, in the third stage of the study, regression analyses are used to estimate the carbon pass-through rates. Regression analyses on the pass-through of carbon costs to electricity prices are conducted for all five states in the NEM individually.</Para>

                <Heading>Estimation procedure</Heading>
                <Para>The abovementioned uncovered links between carbon and wholesale electricity spot prices across the NEM are further investigated in this section through statistically estimating the pass-through rates. More specifically, to analyse empirically the impact of the carbon price on electricity prices, a model based on regression analysis as developed by Sijm et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2008</CitationRef>) and Chen et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2008</CitationRef>) is employed. The basic assumption of this model is that the changes in wholesale electricity prices can be predominately attributed to variations in carbon and fuel prices. Hence it assumes that other factors and generation costs affecting power prices, such as changes in capital prices, operational and maintenance costs, changes in technology, market power, market structure, generation capacity, and risk are constant over the period investigated.<Footnote ID="Fn24">
                    <Para>It is important to note that a major characteristic of electricity spot prices is that they are strongly event-driven and, hence, are more volatile than the forward markets. For example, unexpected plant outages or demand hikes because of hot weather or other factors could cause significant fluctuations in prices of spot markets. However, due to the lack of data and analytical tools, it is often not possible to account for the impact of these events and factors on spot prices in a quantitative way, which may lead to overestimation or underestimation of the CPTRs. Thus, as discussed earlier, concerns could arise regarding the robustness or exactness of the estimated CPTRs, as these estimates may be biased and, hence, inconclusive due to the incidence of other factors besides fuel/carbon costs affecting electricity spot prices. However, in this paper, following Sijm et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2008</CitationRef>), to account for some demand-related events on electricity spot prices, a demand parameter was included in the regression (detailed discussion can be found in Sects. <InternalRef RefID="Sec9">4.1</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Sec10">4.2</InternalRef>). It is important to stress that the findings still must be interpreted prudently. Nevertheless, the author still believes that the model would offer some useful insights with regard to the actual impact of the carbon price on wholesale electricity spot prices in comparison with previous studies. The reasoning behind this is that previous studies have simulated the impact of the carbon price using data with similar deficiencies rather than statistically evaluated the actual impact. For example, Wild et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR57">2012</CitationRef>) ignores outages in thermal generators for the simulation analysis, and Nelson et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2010b</CitationRef>) focus on the emission intensities.</Para>
                  </Footnote> It also assumes that fuel costs are fully and directly passed on to electricity prices. Moreover, another assumption of the model is that during the observation period, electricity prices were set by a single technology with a fixed fuel efficiency rate. However, in reality during even a day, prices can be set by a variety of technologies with different fuel efficiencies depending on a number of factors such as the specific load hour, dynamic interaction between fuel and carbon prices, the outage schedule of the generation, etc. Thus, it should be noted that these assumptions may impact on the robustness or exactness of the estimated carbon pass-through rates, potentially resulting in biased estimates.</Para>
                <Para>Based on these assumptions, the carbon cost pass-through rate can be simply estimated through an OLS regression analysis as follows:<Equation ID="Equ2">

                           <Subscript>1</Subscript>. In this context, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">b</Emphasis>
                           <Subscript>1</Subscript> coefficient can be interpreted as representing the degree to which carbon costs incurred by generators translate into general increases in wholesale electricity prices (the carbon pass-through rate). In the explanation of the CPTR, if the resulting estimate of <Emphasis Type="Italic">b</Emphasis>
                           <Subscript>1</Subscript> is less than unity, then there is less than complete pass-through of the carbon costs into electricity prices, which is an indication that some portion of carbon costs are being internally absorbed by generators. If the estimated <Emphasis Type="Italic">b</Emphasis>
                           <Subscript>
                    <Emphasis Type="Italic">1</Emphasis>
                  </Subscript> equals unity, then there is complete pass-through and the incidence of taxation would apparently be borne by consumers, rather than generators. When the <Emphasis Type="Italic">b</Emphasis>
                           <Subscript>1</Subscript> is greater than unity, it shows that there is more than complete pass-through. In this case, the carbon price would have a magnified effect on electricity prices and it could increase the potential for windfall profits by generators.<Footnote ID="Fn26">
                    <Para>From a statistical point of view, the estimated <Emphasis Type="Italic">b</Emphasis>
                                 <Subscript>1</Subscript> might be overestimated/underestimated due to fundamental assumptions of the model which ignore the impacts of other factors on the wholesale electricity spot prices. However, in practice, as discussed earlier in footnote 10, it could be interpreted as a potential windfall for some generators depending on the fuel generation mix of their installations and the extent of the free allocation of carbon units. Furthermore, given that the Australian Financial Markets Association’s (AFMA) addendum allows generators and retailers to add a carbon price to the contract price, this, in turn, could increase the possibility of windfall profits and “double dipping” by generators and retailers. “Double dipping” here refers to the potential ability of generators and retailers to pass through the carbon cost for every MWh sold, which is in addition to the increased wholesale electricity price in which the carbon price is already incorporated (for more detailed discussion, see the AFMA Carbon Benchmark Addendum <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  </Footnote> Sijm et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2008</CitationRef>) lay out a similar explanation in their investigation of the impact of the EUAs on electricity prices.</Para>
                <Para>As discussed earlier, this paper investigates the impact of demand for electricity (<Emphasis Type="Italic">d</Emphasis>
                           <Superscript>e</Superscript>) on spot prices in the evaluation of the carbon pass-through rates (<Emphasis Type="Italic">b</Emphasis>
                           <Subscript>1</Subscript>). The reasoning behind this is that spot prices can be influenced significantly by some event-driven factors such as demand-related events, weather-related or equipment failure-related events. Due to a lack of data, it is very difficult to evaluate the impact of these events on electricity prices. However, this paper captures the impact of some demand-related events on power prices by the demand for electricity as a key factor (in addition to fuel and carbon costs) in spot market regression analysis. Finally, the impact of all non-stable components in the fuel spread is captured by the error term (e<Subscript>

                        </Para>
                <Para>It is apparent from Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab3">3</InternalRef> that all of the five estimates for carbon costs pass-through rates (CPTRs) are statistically significant at the 10 % level. The statistically significant and positive sign of the carbon price supports the earlier argument that the introduction of the carbon pricing mechanism contributed to the increase in electricity prices in Australia. The estimated CPTRs vary from state to state, ranging between 1.01 and 1.32. These differences between states could be mainly attributed to different generation technologies, variations in the carbon intensities of the generation units setting the price during the various load periods, differences in demand elasticities, as well as variances in market structure. The findings reveal that for NSW and VIC, carbon costs are being totally passed to consumers; while for QLD, SA and TAS, the increases in wholesale electricity prices were greater than carbon costs, leading to additional profits for power producers (windfall profits). However, it should be emphasised that the statistical estimates of the CPTRs for the spot markets have to be interpreted cautiously due to the fundamental assumptions of the model which have ignored the incidence of other factors that may be influencing the spot prices (such as changes in capital costs, the merit order effect, seasonal factors, extreme or rapidly changing weather patterns, changes in market structure, and plant-outage events).</Para>
                <Para>As is apparent from Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab3">3</InternalRef>, the estimated CPTRs in NSW and VIC are similar and approximately equal to 1, reflecting the average emission intensity of each state market at any point in time. These results accord exactly with economic theory where the marginal costs of production increase in line with the carbon costs.<Footnote ID="Fn29">
                    <Para>According to the economic theory, the CPTR is expected to be 1 in the case of a perfect competition market and fixed demand with zero price elasticity (Sijm et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2008</CitationRef>). Moreover, when the supply is perfectly elastic (i.e. flat line), the pass-through is 100 %.</Para>
                  </Footnote> Based on this analysis, the most notable results are that the estimated CPTRs in QLD, TAS, and SA deviate from 1, and more specifically, are greater than 1. These outcomes indicate that carbon costs would be passed to wholesale electricity spot prices to a higher degree in these regions in comparison to VIC, and NSW. Based on these results, one could conclude that there could be potential for windfall profits for some generators. In this case, at the margin, the incremental increase in revenue associated with the carbon price-induced increase in wholesale electricity prices would exceed the incremental increase in variable costs associated with the imposition of the carbon tax, resulting in windfall profits. Furthermore, as mentioned above, if regulation allows the generators and the retailers to pass through the carbon cost for every MWh sold to consumers, as this increase in price would be in addition to the carbon-induced increase in wholesale prices, then the implementation of the CPM could result in the potential for “double dipping” as well. However, from an empirical or statistical point of view, as discussed in Sect. <InternalRef RefID="Sec9">4.1</InternalRef>, the coefficient <Emphasis Type="Italic">b</Emphasis>
                           <Subscript>1</Subscript> could be overestimated (underestimated) because of a change in the merit order,<Footnote ID="Fn30">
                    <Para>Since the carbon cost per unit of production is not similar for each generation technology, the merit order of power generation technologies may shift over time by the introduction of the carbon price, depending on the dynamics and interaction of the actual carbon and fuel costs of the plants impacting electricity prices.</Para>
                  </Footnote> or due to a misspecification of the marginal unit setting the price. Moreover, the incidence of other factors (besides carbon and fuel costs) affecting spot prices, such as higher capital costs for new electricity generation plants and equipment failure events, could lead to the over/underestimation of the CPTRs. These factors have not been taken into account in this paper when conducting statistical analyses to estimate the pass-through rates due to the lack of available data.</Para>
                <Para>Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab3">3</InternalRef> shows Queensland as having the highest level of carbon pass-through rates relative to the other states. This result suggests that carbon costs have been passed on to spot prices to the largest extent observed of any state in the NEM. However, a similar argument to that discussed above can also be applied to the case of Queensland. For instance, the increases in electricity prices could be partly attributed to some price spikes that occurred in January 2013 due to extremely hot weather. The consequent price increases may have contributed to the rise of the <Emphasis Type="Italic">b</Emphasis>

                    <Emphasis Type="Italic">1</Emphasis>
                  </Subscript> for this state.<Footnote ID="Fn31">
                    <Para>The OLS regression analysis is also applied on price series after eliminating these observed price spikes. The results are similar in sign and statistical significance. In this case, the estimated CPTR for QLD decreases to 1.18. They are available upon request.</Para>

                        </Para>
                <Para>The other surprising result is the high level of the carbon pass-through rate in Tasmania given that it has the lowest rate of emission intensity within the NEM. According to the 2013 Australian Energy Market Operator’s report, the increase in Tasmanian electricity prices could to some extent be explained by the higher costs of producing electricity in that state (in addition to carbon costs) due to the dominance of hydro generation, which has relatively higher marginal costs (AEMO 2013d). Furthermore, the practice of importing electricity from Victoria in peak load periods via the Basslink Interconnector exposes Tasmania to Victoria’s prevailing cost structures and price levels. Victoria is much more susceptible to carbon costs because it has the highest emission intensity within the NEM.<Footnote ID="Fn32">
                    <Para>In Victoria, the demand for electricity is primarily met by brown coal-fired generators which are the most carbon-intensive plants (ABARES <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2011b</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  </Footnote> These factors would tend to escalate the rate of increase in wholesale price levels in Tasmania. The consequent increase in prices is consistent with an increase in the magnitude of the estimated <Emphasis Type="Italic">b</Emphasis>
                           <Subscript>1</Subscript> coefficient for this region.</Para>
                <Para>In the case of South Australia, price increases could be primarily associated with carbon costs and increased dispatch of the relatively more expensive Natural Gas Combined-Cycle (NGCC) and Gas Thermal plants during the peak period, located in the Greater Adelaide nodal region (Wild et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR57">2012</CitationRef>). More specifically, changes in the merit order, a phenomenon that is excluded from simple theoretical reasoning, could account for the deviation of CPTR from unity in this state. Changes in the merit order may be caused by the increased economic attractiveness of cleaner natural gas under a carbon price. The rising costs of generating electricity by gas and NGCC were directly transferred to electricity prices, leading to a higher <Emphasis Type="Italic">b</Emphasis>
                           <Subscript>1</Subscript> coefficient for South Australia. Furthermore, increased imports from Victoria to South Australia due to the seasonal shutdown of the Northern Power Station could have contributed to higher electricity prices in South Australia over the period investigated (AEMO <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2013b</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para>In summary, these results are consistent with the hypothesis of the paper that in the short run, consumers rather than generators are bearing the incidence of the carbon tax. This finding confirms the previous evidence in ROAM Consulting (<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2008</CitationRef>) and Simshauser and Doan (<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">2009</CitationRef>) who suggest there is a significant rate of carbon costs pass-through to electricity prices. The results demonstrate that coal-fired power generators are likely to recover the average marginal costs by passing the increased costs on to consumers in the form of higher wholesale prices. The findings are confirmed by the 2013 AMEO report, which indicates that gas-fired generation did not significantly displace coal-fired generation after the introduction of the CPM (AMEO 2013b).</Para>

              <Heading>Summary and conclusions</Heading>
              <Para>The contribution of this study is to analyse the actual impact of the carbon price on electricity prices. More specifically, it examines temporal links between carbon prices, electricity, coal and natural gas prices over the July 2010–October 2013 time period. Some short-run interactions between variables have been found. Of particular relevance are (1) a Granger causal relationship running from the carbon price to the price of electricity; (2) a Granger causal link running from coal prices to electricity prices; and (3) a Granger causal link running from natural gas to electricity prices.</Para>
              <Para>Given that there are temporal links between carbon and electricity prices, by employing an empirical model this paper also estimates the pass-through rates of CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> allowance costs of power generation on to wholesale electricity spot prices across the NEM. It finds empirical results for NSW and VIC that support the hypothesis that firms pass through the full costs of carbon to wholesale electricity prices, which is reflected in carbon costs pass-through rates that are close to 1. This finding is consistent with several hypotheses.</Para>
              <Para>Based on this analysis, there is also empirical evidence to show that in some states including QLD, SA, and TAS, the increases in electricity prices have even exceeded the carbon costs, resulting in an increase in the magnitude of the estimates of <Emphasis Type="Italic">b</Emphasis>
                        <Subscript>1</Subscript> (greater than 1).</Para>
              <Para>The extent of pass-through rates estimated here demonstrates that carbon costs would be unlikely to be internally absorbed to a significant extent by generators, suggesting that firms might benefit from the implementation of the CPM due to increased market prices. This could be interpreted as an increase in the potential for windfall profits by some generators.</Para>
              <Para>These findings could have a number of policy implications. First, the evidence reported here on the degree of the pass-through indicates that if there is a transition to an emission trading scheme under the new government applying the grandfathering method (free allocation of allowances), it could increase the potential for windfall profits. The grandfathering approach to free allocation of allowances for generators could even encourage investments in CO<Subscript>2</Subscript>-intensive power plants to obtain the economic rents arising from the free permits. In this regard, full auctioning of permits would be a better policy option. Second, these findings undermine the government financial assistance to power generators including the annual issue of 41.705 million free carbon units and the provision of $1 billion of cash payments as compensation for the introduction of a carbon price (Clean Energy Regulator <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2013</CitationRef>). Such financial supports to emissions-intensive power stations could lead to substantial windfall profits for generators.</Para>
              <Para>Finally, to address concerns related to carbon-induced increases in power prices, in addition to linking to the EU ETS, a more efficient climate policy would be to import credits generated by the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms (Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation), providing greater availability of cheap project-based credits and international permits for compliance buyers may decrease the price of emissions permits and hence the pass-through of the carbon cost to power prices.</Para>
