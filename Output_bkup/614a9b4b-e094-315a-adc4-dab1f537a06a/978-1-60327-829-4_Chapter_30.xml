            <Para TextBreak="No">The immune system has demonstrated the ability to participate in cancer surveillance, but its role in promoting anticancer activity has only begun to be harnessed. Advances over the last 10 years have made the possibility of immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer a more realistic possibility. Prostate cancer is an ideal target for immunotherapy given its relatively slow growth rate and the time required to generate immune responses. This chapter will discuss an antibody to cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), which can dampen the restraints on T-cell activity to incite a T cell response to tumor, resulting in immune-mediated tumor regression, and the experience with this mechanism in treating advanced prostate cancer.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Successful immunotherapy requires the generation of an antigen-specific T cell response. The major components of this response are antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages, and T lymphocytes. APCs digest tumor antigens and present them on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. They are then presented to T lymphocytes, where two independent signals are required for activation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1_30">1</CitationRef>â€“<CitationRef CitationID="CR3_30">3</CitationRef>]. The first arises from the interaction between the MHC-bound antigen on the surface of the APC and the corresponding antigen-specific T-cell receptor. The second, or costimulatory signal, results from the interaction between B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86), which are molecules present on the surface of APCs, with the T cell receptor CD28. This signal facilitates T-cell activation, promotes T-cell proliferation, and induces T-cell differentiation to the effector phenotype.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">There is, however, an important mechanism that is thought to provide balance to this system by preventing too robust an immune response with possible resulting autoimmunity. After CD28 on the T-cell binds to the B7 ligands on the APC, resulting in T-cell activation, CTLA-4 (CD152) relocates to the surface of the T-cell (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">30.1</InternalRef>). CTLA-4 is a homolog of CD28 but binds to B7 with 50â€“200 times the affinity of CD28 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4_30">4</CitationRef>]. Instead of providing a costimulatory signal, it provides an inhibitory signal to T cells. This serves to abrogate T-cell activation. Evidence of the clinical role of CTLA-4 in preventing too an robust immune response is provided by transgenic mice lacking the CTLA-4 receptor [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5_30">5</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR6_30">6</CitationRef>]. These mice experience severe lymphoproliferative disorders, which result in multiorgan polyclonal lymphocytic infiltrates and death within 1 month. Further evidence is provided by the fact that mice that lack not only the CTLA-4 receptor but also the CD28 T-cell receptor do not experience the lymphoproliferative disorder [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7_30">7</CitationRef>]. This suggests that, without the costimulatory signal from CD28, there is no need for the inhibitory signal that CTLA-4 binding to B7 provides.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

                    <SimplePara>Mechanism of T cell activation. (<Emphasis Type="Bold">a</Emphasis>) T cell activation requires two signals: (1) binding between the MHC/antigen/TCR; (2) costimulatory signal between CD28 and B7. When these signals occur, CTLA-4 is recruited to the T-cell surface. (<Emphasis Type="Bold">b</Emphasis>) CTLA-4 competes with CD28 for binding to B7. When CTLA-4 binds to B7, it inactivates the T cell, resulting in down-regulation of the T cell immune response. (<Emphasis Type="Bold">c</Emphasis>) CTLA-4 binding to B7 can be blocked with a monoclonal antibody to CTLA-4. This results in augmented T cell activation</SimplePara>

            <Para TextBreak="No">The above observations were taken into preclinical models for confirmation and exploration of clinical utility. It was observed that blockade of the CTLA-4 receptor with an antibody promoted the regression of solid tumors in mice [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8_30">8</CitationRef>]. C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously with tumor cells from TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate), followed by administration of an anti-CTLA-4 antibody in a proportion of mice. Nearly all of the mice administered anti-CTLA-4 antibody experienced partial or complete regression of subcutaneous TRAMP tumors. In addition, when mice with TRAMP tumors underwent surgical tumor removal, those administered anti-CTLA-4 antibody had metastatic outgrowth that was decreased by approximately 50% [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9_30">9</CitationRef>]. In these preclinical models, the only evidence of autoimmunity was the development of prostatitis and vitiligo.</Para>

          <Section1 ID="Sec3">
            <Heading>Clinical</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Given the success with CTLA-4 blockade in preclinical models, a fully humanized antibody was developed with the goal of using it in human anticancer therapy without generating antibodies to the therapy. The antibody ipilimumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb, New Jersey) targets the CTLA-4 receptor and has undergone extensive evaluation in melanoma and prostate cancer. For the purpose of this chapter, the discussion will focus on its evaluation in prostate cancer.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The first human study was done in 14 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10_30">10</CitationRef>]. Patients had a median age of 70, and a median prostate specific antigen (PSA) of 84.6 ng/mL; all 14 patients had evidence of bone metastases and, an additional four patients had soft tissue metastases, as well. In this study, patients received a single dose of 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab. It was well tolerated with a half-life of 12.5 Â± 5.3 days. Two patients experienced PSA declines of at least 50%, lasting 60 and 135 days. These two patients underwent retreatment with a second dose of ipilimumab at the time of PSA progression but neither responded again. An additional eight out of 14 treated patients had a decline in PSA of &lt;50%. Toxicity was reasonable with one patient experiencing a grade three rash/pruritis, which responded to systemic corticosteroids. This suggested that a single dose of ipilimumab was well tolerated and associated with some antitumor activity.</Para>

            <Heading>Combination Therapy</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Repetitive doses have also been administered, both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents. Multiple studies have evaluated whether vaccination with tumor cells modified to express granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can improve the effectiveness of CTLA-4 blockade. Treatment of TRAMP mice with a vaccine consisting of irradiated tumor cells modified to secrete GM-CSF resulted in a reduction in tumor incidence 2 months after treatment [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11_30">11</CitationRef>]. Treated mice were also found to have lower grade tumors with accumulation of inflammatory cells in interductal spaces.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">GM-CSF is a growth factor for APCs and is able to induce PSA declines in patients with CRPC. Results from a phase I trial of GM-CSF in combination with escalating doses of ipilimumab have been reported [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12_30">12</CitationRef>]. GM-CSF was administered 250 Î¼g/m<Superscript>2</Superscript>/day SQ on days 1â€“14 of a 28-day cycle. Ipilimumab was administered as doses ranging from 0.5 to 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks, originally 4 times and eventually 6 times per patient. In the highest dose level reported to date (3 mg/kg), 50% of patients experienced PSA declines of at least 50%, and one patient experienced a partial radiographic response in liver metastases. Three of the 24 patients treated had grade three immune-related toxicities: grade three rash in one patient at a dosage of 1.5 mg/kg, grade three rash and panhypopituitarism in one patient at 3 mg/kg, and grade three colitis in one patient treated at 3 mg/kg. There was evidence of a doseâ€“response relationship between anti-CTLA-4 antibody dosage and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells after treatment. In addition, an expansion of circulating CD4+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, which are thought to be immunosuppressive, was also seen with treatment. Once the maximum tolerated dose has been determined, a phase II expansion cohort and a randomized phase II study of ipilimumab monotherapy or in combination with GM-CSF is planned.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Ipilimumab has also been combined with the prostate cancer vaccine GVAX [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13_30">13</CitationRef>]. GVAX is a prostate cancer cell line modified to secrete GM-CSF and irradiated. A phase I/II study of GVAX in combination with ipilimumab is underway and has been reported. During the dose escalation portion of the study, 12 patients were treated with biweekly intradermal injections of GVAX and every 4 week doses of ipilimumab at a dosage of either 0.3 or 1 or 3 or 5 mg/kg. Median follow-up for these 12 patients is 21.2 months, and five of six patients treated at 3 or 5 mg/kg experienced grade two or three immune-related toxicities, including one patient with grade two or three hypophysitis and one patient with grade three alveolitis. Late onset PSA responses were seen in five patients, with durations of 6.7, 8.6, 9.5, 13.8 (ongoing), and 23.1 months. Four patients had stable disease by bone scan for at least 12 months. The expansion cohort consisted of 16 patients treated at a dosage of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab. Six patients have completed treatment; three have experienced immune-related toxicities, including one with grade one diarrhea, one with grade three adrenal insufficiency, and one with grade three hepatitis, which resolved with steroids. The median follow-up in the six patients who have completed treatment is 6.5 months; one patient has had a PSA decline of at least 50%, and three additional patients have had a stable PSA (including one patient with pain relief). Tumor-reactive antibodies induced by treatment have been identified using serologic analysis and include antibodies to filamin B, PSMA, and NY-ESO-1. Biopsies of injection sites have revealed evidence of T-cell infiltration. These results suggest that the use of CTLA-4 blockade in combination with other immunostimulatory therapies is promising and well tolerated. In addition, they provide proof of principle that an antigen-specific immune response can be generated.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">However, the question arises as to whether there is a more effective way to improve antigen presentation to augment the immunostimulatory effects of CTLA-4 blockade. The cytotoxic effects of radiotherapy could potentially serve as a means of antigen priming, improving antigen presentation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14_30">14</CitationRef>]. Radiation has long been known to have the ability to reduce tumor growth outside the field of radiation, which is known as the abscopal effect [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15_30">15</CitationRef>]. The biology of this is poorly understood, but it is thought to generate both tumor-specific antigen from dying cells and maturation stimuli necessary for the activation of tumor-specific T cells by dendritic cells [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16_30">16</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17_30">17</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">This theory was demonstrated in a study of mice with a syngeneic mammary carcinoma in both flanks who received radiation with or without a dendritic cell growth factor, Flt3-Ligand (Flt3-L) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17_30">17</CitationRef>]. One tumor was irradiated and the effect on the other tumor was recorded. In mice who received radiation alone, the growth of the nonirradiated tumor was not impaired, while in mice who received Flt3-L, in addition to radiation, growth of the nonirradiated tumor was impaired. Growth of the nonirradiated tumor was not impaired in mice who received Flt3-L without radiation, suggesting radiation has the potential for additional benefit when combined with other agents. The dose of radiation (either two or six Gray) did not affect the results in this study. The effects were also noted to be tumor-specific; treatment with Flt-3 and radiation did not affect a second tumor of a different type. Demaria et al. have also shown that the combination of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and CTLA-4 blockade can be synergistic for inducing tumor responses in a murine model of an implantable breast cancer tumor line [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17_30">17</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Based on the above results, a clinical trial for pre- and postchemotherapy patients with metastatic CRPC was launched, in which patients were treated with escalating doses of ipilimumab every 3 weeks for four doses at levels of 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18_30">18</CitationRef>]. After the 10 mg/kg cohort was completed, a single fraction of radiation to up to three bony sites of disease was given within 24â€“48 h prior to initiating the first dose of ipilimumab. The primary endpoint was safety. Results for the first 26 patients have been reported to date, including eight, six, and six patients treated at the 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg dose levels, respectively, and six patients treated in the first radiation cohort. Nine patients experienced grade three or four immune-related toxicities, including diarrhea/colitis in six, hepatitis in two, and rash in one. Toxicities were responsive to immunosuppression. One patient died of opportunistic infections after 3 months of immunosuppression for colitis. Six patients (23%) experienced a PSA decline of at least 50% with a median duration of 140 days and a range from 49 to over 269 days. The median time for onset of response was 84 days with a range from 41 to 147, underscoring the need to allow for prolonged period until response is observed in studies of this agent. One of seven patients with measurable disease had a partial response in nodal metastases and the prostate and achieved an undetectable PSA after treatment with 10 mg/kg. All patients who experienced responses also experienced immune-related toxicities. Phase III evaluation of ipilimumab in combination with radiation is underway.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Immune-related toxicities have been termed immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) and are thought to result from exuberant activity of the immune system causing self-directed immune activity. In melanoma, these events have been demonstrated to correlate with tumor regression [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19_30">19</CitationRef>]. Attia et al. evaluated 56 patients with metastatic melanoma, 29 of whom were treated with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks and 27 of whom were treated with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. All the patients also received vaccination with two modified HLA-A*0201-restricted peptides from the gp100 melanoma-associated antigen, gp100:209â€“217(210 M) and gp100:280â€“288(288 V). Two patients had complete responses, which were ongoing at the time of report at 30 and 31 months and five patients had partial responses, lasting four, six, and ongoing at 25, 26, and 34 months. The overall objective response rate for the cohort was 13%. Fourteen patients experienced grade three or four IRAEs. Five (36%) out of the 14 patients who experienced these toxicities had a clinical response, compared to only two (5%) responses in the 42 patients without autoimmune toxicity (<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis> = 0.008). This correlation demonstrates a relationship between IRAEs and activity in melanoma. A similar relationship in prostate cancer has not been definitively demonstrated but is hypothesized to exist, as well.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The mechanism for these toxicities has been demonstrated to be immune in nature with colonoscopies performed on patients with enterocolitis demonstrating increases in intraepithelial lymphocytes, increases in CD3 and CD8 T-cell markers, as well as increases in CD3+ CD4+ lymphocytes and eosinophils [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19_30">19</CitationRef>]. Similarly, biopsy of areas involved by dermatitis revealed papillary dermal edema, at times with pervascular lymphocytic infiltrates, which was CD3+ CD8+ and CD3+ CD4+. Liver biopsy revealed acute hepatitis with a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate in a lobular pattern of inflammation and predominantly CD4+ cells in the periportal regions and CD8+ cells in the hepatic lobules. Most of the noncancer-bearing organs targeted by T cells for the toxicities observed (colon, duodenum, liver, eye, and pituitary) do not express the gp100 antigen, suggesting that the autoimmunity was not a result of the peptide vaccination, but rather the result of broken self-tolerance induced by CTLA-4 blockade.</Para>

            <Heading>Future Directions</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Recently, immunogenic prostate tumor antigens identified by CTLA-4 blockade have been reported. Using the TRAMP model, CTLA-4 in vivo blockade was administered in combination with a GM-CSF expressing TRAMP-C2 cell vaccine to generate an anti-TRAMP tumor response in nontransgenic, syngeneic C57BL/6 mice [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20_30">20</CitationRef>]. Tumor-specific T cells were isolated, and the first T-cell-defined TRAMP tumor antigen was expression cloned. It has been named <Emphasis Type="Italic">Spas-1</Emphasis> (stimulator of prostatic adenocarcinoma-specific T cells-1), and its expression is found to be increased in advanced primary TRAMP tumors. Immunization with dendritic cells pulsed with a peptide containing its immunodominant epitope SNC9-Ha resulted in protection against TRAMP-C2 tumor challenge, suggesting that this is a potentially attractive target antigen for the development of antigen-targeted immunotherapies, likely in combination with CTLA-4 directed therapy. SPAS-1 has a human ortholog known as SH3GLB2, which is known to be immunogenic in humans in vitro. The future for CTLA-4 blockade is likely to be in combination with other agents, such as vaccination with a SH3GLB2 containing peptide, with the hope of generating a more specific response.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In addition, CTLA-4 blockade will likely be combined with therapies that attempt to uncouple antitumor activity from toxicity. CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a naturally occurring subpopulation of T cells with immunosuppressive function. Tregs prevent autoimmunity but can also inhibit rejection of transplants, regulate the immune response to infectious diseases, and suppress antitumor responses. Although present in mice and humans, at approximately 3â€“10% of all CD4+ T cells, Tregs have been shown to accumulate in blood and tumor sites in murine cancer models and cancer patients. The presence of Tregs within tumors has been shown to be inversely correlated with survival in ovarian cancer patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21_30">21</CitationRef>]. Treg depletion can induce tumor rejection in some murine tumor models [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22_30">22</CitationRef>]. The addition of Treg depletion to treatment with CTLA4 blockade can enhance antitumor immunity in mouse models [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23_30">23</CitationRef>]. Treatment with anti-CTLA4 antibody has been demonstrated to expand Tregs in vivo in prostate cancer patients. Depletion of Tregs may therefore enhance the antitumor immune responses induced with CTLA4 blockade in cancer patients.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Naturally occurring Tregs constitutively express CD25, a component of the high-affinity IL2 receptor, on their cell surface. Denileukin diftitox (Ontak, Ligand Pharmaceuticals) is an IL2-fusion toxin that is FDA-approved for use in treatment of cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL), an IL2 receptor-expressing malignancy. Denileukin diftitox has been shown to reduce Tregs in tissue culture and in vivo in renal cell and ovarian cancer patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24_30">24</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR25_30">25</CitationRef>]. Similarly, metronomic chemotherapy, specifically, oral cyclophosphamide, has demonstrated the ability to deplete Tregs in advanced cancer patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26_30">26</CitationRef>]. A better understanding of the role of Tregs and the utilization of methods to deplete them may make use of CTLA-4 blockade, a more realistic clinical possibility.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">There have been recent strides in understanding the role of Tregs with the demonstration that anti-CTLA-4 antibody does not deplete human regulatory T cells in vivo; instead, it may mediate its effects through the activation of effector T cells [<CitationRef CitationID="CR27_30">27</CitationRef>]. Tregs constitutively express higher levels of CTLA-4 that translocate to the cell surface than effector T cells, and therefore, they may be more strongly regulated by the inhibitor effects of CTLA-4 than effector T cells. Lower antibody doses may actually result in the expansion of regulatory T cells, with expansion of effector T cells only at a higher threshold antibody dosage. This may make it possible to modulate the immune response to CTLA-4 blockade in the future using antibody dosage.</Para>

            <Heading>Conclusions</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Much remains to be learned about the role of the immune system in cancer treatment and what stage of disease is the best place for application for these agents. In addition, the clinical trials community is learning how to design trials around immunologic agents, which may require additional time to demonstrate responses. Advances are being made in many of these issues, and if the toxicity of CTLA-4 blockade can be managed without compromising efficacy, the potential of CTLA-4 blockade for anticancer therapy is likely to be harnessed for clinical benefit.</Para>
