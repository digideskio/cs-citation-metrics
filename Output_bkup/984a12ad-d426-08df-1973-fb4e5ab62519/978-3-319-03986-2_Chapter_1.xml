          <Para TextBreak="No">Many people (including students of sociology) often wonder about the relevance of social sciences (especially sociology) to health issues. In general, it is often a challenge to discuss the nexus between social science and health. Why medical sociology? What does sociology have to do with medicine or health? This chapter aims to answer these questions. It starts with the meaning of sociology and its links to health studies—a definition and brief history of medical sociology and topic description of the discipline. All health problems are conceived as social problems, which are the core focus of sociological studies. This chapter explains the characteristics of social problems with regard to health issues. Health problems are viewed as parts of social pathologies by advancing the sociological dimensions of health problems. The chapter then attempts to re-explain the topical description of medical sociology (first advanced by David Mechanic in 1968)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Mechanic, D.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> and includes some current issues. The topical descriptions specifically include social aetiology of disease, cultural beliefs and social response to illness, sociology of medical care and hospitals, sociology of psychiatry, social transition and health care, traditional medicine (alternative medicine), sociology of bioethics, health policy and politics, social epidemiology, sociology of dying and death, and medical education.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">Many people (including students of sociology) often wonder about the relevance of sociology to health issues. In general, it is often a challenge to discuss the nexus between social science and health. Why medical sociology? What does sociology have to do with medicine or health? These are some of the pressing questions that require explanations. The fundamental problem starts with a lack of deeper knowledge of the meaning and focus of sociology. Therefore, it is necessary to proceed by defining sociology and briefly explaining some of its foundational focus. After this, its relevance to health will be explained.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Sociology<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm> has been variously defined since Auguste Comte coined the term in 1838. Simply, sociology is the study of human society and social problems. Sociology is the scientific study of social relations, institutions, and society (Smelser <CitationRef CitationID="CR45">1994</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Smelser, N.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. In addition, sociology can be defined as the scientific study of the dynamics of society and their intricate connection to patterns of behaviour. It focuses on social structure and how the structures interact to modify human behaviour, actions, opportunities, and how the patterns of social existence engender social problems. Social institutions include kinship, economic, political, education, and religious institutions. The institutions are like pillars that hold up society because they are the constituent parts of the social system<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Social system</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> (society). These parts are interdependent and interrelated with specialised functions towards the survival of the society. This is why the human society is often referred to as a social system. Every institution fulfils some functional imperatives. The family institution supports the procreation and socialisation of new members of society while the economic institution deals with the production and exchange of goods. The economic institution employs people from the family institutions, and the family in turn needs the goods and services produced by the economic institution. The health institutions are organised to cater to the well-being and survival of human beings.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Generally, sociology employs scientific approach to study and develops generalisations about human patterns, groupings, and behaviour. In a more concise definition, the American Sociological Association (ASA)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>American Sociological Association (ASA)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> defined sociology “as the study of social life, social change, and the social causes and consequences of human behaviour”. Social life is the most central part of the focus of sociology; it implies the connection which an individual holds with others in the society. To sociologists, social life or interaction is the essence of human existence. The process of social interaction itself may put individuals at risk of some communicable disease<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Communicable disease</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> such as tuberculosis (TB)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Tuberculosis (TB)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, and measles. In terms of communicable diseases, mere contact with an infected person (in the process of social interaction) can normally put others at risk. The investigation of social “causes” and consequences is basic in sociological research. There is often a problem of biomedical reductionism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Biomedical reductionism</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, assuming “only the germ causes the disease” without an interrogation of the social conditions enabling vulnerability<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Vulnerability</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> to diseases. For instance, commercial sex work puts an individual more at risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\t see Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> than many other occupation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Occupation</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> groups: that is a kind of occupational condition, which is a risk factor for HIV.</Para>

            </IndexTerm> and industrialisation marked the beginning of unprecedented social alteration, especially since the beginning of the eighteenth century. This social change led to a number of problems as a result of changes in the relations of production. The industrial revolution led to new forms of production systems, community relations, migration<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Primary>Industrialisation</Primary>

              <Primary>Industrial revolution</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, but they rapidly multiplied during that period. Social problems are conceived as strains within the system, seen as the product of certain objective conditions within the society, which is inimical or detrimental to the realisation of some norms or values for members of the society (Lyman et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR38">1973</CitationRef>, p. 474)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Lyman, S.M.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Any issue that threatens the well-being or survival of the society is regarded as a social problem. Weber (<CitationRef CitationID="CR52">1995</CitationRef>, p. 9)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Para TextBreak="No">It is important to note that just as crime is damaging to the society or individual, so is any health problem. Apart from this fact, a social problem can be identified through the following characteristics, which include:</Para>

Even when subjective interpretation may be required, a social problem is an <Emphasis Type="Italic">evidence-based</Emphasis> problem, not just mere perception of an individual but a general knowledge that is usually definite. This represents a utilitarian view, which holds that social problems are objective things, or what Durkheim regarded as social facts<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

This point should be noted as a relevant perspective in explanation of human health/diseases and not an absolute explanation. For instance, Wellcome (<CitationRef CitationID="CR53">2002</CitationRef>, p. 30), summarising Day Karen’s research report, observed that “… Falciparum parasite [malaria] we see today arose about 3200–7000 years ago—an era that coincides with the dawn of agriculture<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                      <Primary>Agriculture</Primary>

                      <Primary>Africa</Primary>
                    </IndexTerm>. This was a time of massive ecological change, when humans began to live in large communities and the rainforest was being cut down for slash-and-burn agriculture… there was also a major change in the mosquito vector at that time, when it began biting humans instead of animals… ” It is further observed that P.<Emphasis Type="Italic"> falciparum</Emphasis> migrated with Africans to other parts of the world. This means that the process of migration<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                      <Primary>Migration</Primary>
                    </IndexTerm> aids the spread of malaria<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                      <Primary>Malaria</Primary>
                    </IndexTerm>. This is why Smelser (<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">1996</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                      <Primary>Smelser, N.J.</Primary>
                    </IndexTerm> also observed that the increasing world traffic of people would internationalise many health problems. It is for this reason that HIV, first diagnosed in the United States<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                      <Primary>United States</Primary>
                    </IndexTerm> in the early 1980s (Jackson <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2002</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                      <Primary>Jackson, H.</Primary>
                    </IndexTerm>, is now a global problem. Moreover, some diseases are rooted in genetics<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                      <Primary>Genetics</Primary>
                    </IndexTerm> or heredity, thereby multiplying through marriage patterns or human relationships. Holtz et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2006</CitationRef>, p. 1665)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

This is separate from the social dimensions of health problems, which will be examined later in this book.

            </IndexTerm> or vice versa. Whichever form it takes, it constitutes a pathology that must be remedied by the society. Sociology has been relevant ever since Comte conceived it as a science that would provide <Emphasis Type="Italic">salvation</Emphasis> from all the social problems confronting the world. Improved relevance of sociology in human society will alleviate human suffering and provide equitable well-being. Therefore, the application of sociological methods and perspective and attention to the social dimensions of disease should provide a vital step forward in disease control.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Apart from the fact that health problems constitute a major social problem, it is important to further stress the relevance of sociology to health. First, in this case, it is human health. It is about the people, community, and society. The health of the society cannot be grasped without understanding the intricacies of the community or society itself. George Simmel<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Simmel, G.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> conceived of human society as an intricate web of multiple relations—of people in constant interaction with one another (Coser <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2004</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Coser, L.A.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, of people who are bound with common fate, norms, values, socio-spatial conditions, exposures, and opportunities. It is about the health of people who build and share similar health institutions or who live, for instance, in an African rainforest where they are exposed to mosquito bites every day. It is also about the health of the community that has access or otherwise to simple preventive measures for malaria<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Malaria</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> or diarrhoea. Health is about the society where there is self-accountability to take up smoking and bear the associated health risks. As mentioned earlier, any issue concerning the social collectivity is of enormous interest to sociology. Simply, health is one such issue of interest because it concerns the people and also affects the patterns of social interaction.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Apart from focusing on the people, health is intrinsic to human functioning or existence. It confers a form of capacity on the individual to perform social functions in human society. Human value or existence is enhanced by good health.

            </IndexTerm> is simply the application of sociological perspectives and methods in the study of health issues in human societies with a skewed focus on the sociocultural milieu that accounts for human health and illness. These perspectives include sociological theories and tools, which can be applied in the analysis of human health. In this case, the individual is examined as a member of the society, who partakes in the day-to-day functioning of the social system. The pre-comprehension is that humans exist within a socio-spatial milieu, which often affects their health. Such social conditions and the nature of human interaction are instrumental to the well-being of every individual in society. It is also assumed that the nature of social interaction and networking is a part of the determinants of human health. Sociologists are interested in issues regarding human health and employ systematic procedures to examine social phenomena. They have relied on quantitative and qualitative techniques to establish universal laws governing human societies. The essence of the methods is to look at the social links that can explain sociocultural linkages to health issues. In any case, medical sociology is the application of sociological theories, knowledge, and concepts to issues of health and illness (Hafferty and Castellani <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2006</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Primary>Malaria</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> because they are much more prevalent in poor regions or among the poor. For example, a person residing in a slum is at a higher risk of being exposed to certain diseases which a person in affluent area may have lower risk of being exposed to. Medical sociology is distinct in its approach because it considers the “import that social and structural factors have on the disease and illness processes as well as on the organisation and delivery of health care” (Hafferty and Castellani <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2006</CitationRef>, p. 334)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Hafferty and Castellani further observed that these factors also include culture (e.g., values, beliefs, normative expectations), organisational processes (e.g., hospital setting), politics (e.g., health care policy, health budget, political ideology), economic system (e.g., capitalism<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Para TextBreak="No">Apart from pure research, medical sociologists are also interested in implementation or applied research. This involves the implementation of interventions to improve the health of the population through community engagement<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

He provided four major reasons for the strong academic locus of the subfield. First, the extension of focus from acute to chronic diseases strengthens the relevance of sociology to medicine because of the key roles of social condition and social behaviour in the prevention, onset, and management of chronic disorders. Medical sociologists are more relevant in the analysis of social conditions of health than physicians. Second, medical sociology has focused extensively on issues relating to clinical medicine and health policy<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Health policy</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Third, success over the years in medical sociological research has promoted the professional status of medical sociologists in the analysis of the social patterning of health.

            </IndexTerm>. It can be argued that medical sociology began with the conception of sociology by August Comte (<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">1896</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Comte, A.</Primary>

              <Primary>Organismic analogy</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. This can be a deductive argument since Comte did not intend to establish medical sociology as a subfield and did not attach the importance of sociocultural issues in health. Comte, and later Herbert Spencer (<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">1891</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR48">1896</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Spencer, H.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, extensively compared human society to a biological being. Spencer observed that the universe consists of organic (living), inorganic (nonliving) and super-organic (society) entities. The idea of organismic analogy is that the human society has similar characteristics as that of the biological organism. The similarities include growth and development, differentiation of parts, specialisation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Specialisation</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> of functions, interrelatedness, and interdependence of parts. The parts of the society include the social institutions, which work harmoniously for the survival of the society. The argument further relates that if one part is damaged, it will adversely affect other parts of the society. Health institution may be affected if the political institution is corrupt or not responsive to aspirations of the citizens. This is part of the reasons why strong political will is required in implementation of health programs.</Para>

          <Heading>Topical Description of Medical Sociology</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Many scholars have described medical sociology in various ways: sociology of health and illness or health sociology. “Medical sociology” is more encompassing to describe the broad aspect of sociology dealing with medicine and health in general. One particular description is that of Straus (<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">1957</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Straus, R.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, who averred that medical sociology consists of sociology of medicine<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm> and sociology in medicine<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Primary>Straus, R.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> observed that “[s]tudies of the profession (of medicine) and those dealing with the organization of health resources are primarily in the sociology of medicine<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Sociology of medicine</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> [while] teaching activities and research in which the sociologist is collaborating with the physician in studying a disease process or factors influencing the patient’s response to illness are primarily sociology in medicine.” Straus made the distinction as a result of activities and affiliations of 110 medical sociologists.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Straus (<CitationRef CitationID="CR51">1999</CitationRef>, p. 109)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Straus, R.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> further reiterated that sociology in medicine<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Sociology in medicine</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> involves “activities that were associated with achieving the educational, research, or clinical goals of medicine. These were often collaborative with health professionals and occurred within health or medical institutions. They were carried out most frequently by sociologists who held appointments in health professional-schools, hospitals, or other health-care organisations.” On the other hand, sociology of medicine is close to what could be described as sociology of health and illness. It involves the study of social factors<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Social factors</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> in disease aetiology, incidence, prevalence, distribution, social response to health and illness, therapeutic process, and community health needs<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              <Primary>Straus, R.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> thought it was not feasible for a sociologist to engage in the sociology in and of medicine together; however, later he (<CitationRef CitationID="CR51">1999</CitationRef>) observed that because of crosscutting intellectual development, it is now feasible.

              <Primary>Persons</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> involved. Medical sociology has now grown into a full subdiscipline of sociology with more diverged activities as a result of intellectual and research domains. It is now possible to present a topical description of medical sociology without a topical differentiation between that of sociology in or of medicine. Therefore, another major concern of students of sociology or professional is a clear topical description of medical sociology. It is imperative to explain the intellectual domain of medical sociology. The first major attempt at this was by David Mechanic (<CitationRef CitationID="CR40">1968</CitationRef>)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Mechanic, D.</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, who highlighted a number of intellectual domains of medical sociology. Apart from the fact that there are still some new developments, a re-explanation of some of the domains in line with currents trends is necessary.</Para>

            <Heading>Social Aetiology of Disease</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Medical sociology primarily focuses on the social causes of disease. Social causationism entails direct and indirect (social) exposure to diseases. While a medical doctor will simply note that a patient has HIV, a sociologist is more interested in the sexual network<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

              </IndexTerm> of the patient since HIV can be acquired through the process of sexual interaction with others in the society. This pattern of sexual relation is a social determinant. Another explanation is that the decision to engage in protective sex is entirely that of the parties involved. A medical sociologist is more interested in the “push” factors that expose individuals to any disease. Another example is the high prevalence of vesicovaginal fistula (VVF)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            <Para TextBreak="No">The concerns of this aspect are on the sociocultural aspects of medical care and hospital as a (social) institution.

Choice is usually modified by the cultural belief system in the community. Another main issue is the cost of seeking medical care in relation to affordability and quality of services from medical institutions. These are interwoven issues that have constituted focal points in medical care. Another significant issue is the gender context of medical care and hospital. Analysis of gender issues in terms of care providers and receivers is vital in medical care. At times, experts analyse the importance of cultural competence in health care delivery and desirability of gender concordance (patient-practitioner) in health care<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

It also leads to the emergence of subprofessionals in psychiatry, known as social psychiatrists. Mental health has much to do with lifestyles and social conditions. In fact, most manifestations of mental disorders depict the contravention of normal standards of behaviour in the society. This implies that in most cases, a mental disorder is recognised through excessive abnormal behaviour within the social system<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Change in the society might inform change in health care and there could also be meaningful development in health care as a result of improved technology. Medical sociologists are interested in both. They are riveted in social dynamics and responses of various facets of social organisation. Social change is constant; hence, human society is constantly undergoing numerous forms of social transition. The health care institutions have continuously been responding to changes in all sectors of the society. As a result of changes in the economic systems, for instance, some societies practise a capitalist health system<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            <Para TextBreak="No">Furthermore, one of the primary interests is on the causes of death in human society—especially those causes that have links with sociocultural issues. Such causes are usually studied sociologically and historically. This will expose the social patterns of death: which group dies more from what ailment and why. What are the sociological explanations of the exposure of the group to a particular ailment in the society? More so, sociologists are also interested in passage rite<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
