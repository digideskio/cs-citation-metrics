          <Para TextBreak="No">Agriculture is the backbone of most of the economies of countries in Southern Africa and agricultural production and associated processing industries form a major economic sector of most countries in the region. Agriculture employs over 70 % of the population and agriculture supports the main livelihood systems of about 75 % of the rural population and like in the rest of the developing countries farmers constitute the largest group of natural resource managers. Worldwide, agriculture is expected to feed the increased population that will number 9.1 billion in 2050, while providing income, employment and environmental services (FAO <CitationRef CitationID="CR068">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Globally, it is reported that since 2010 half of the world’s population lives in cities and that the world’s urban population will almost double from the current 3.5 billion (about 50 %) to more than six billion by 2050 (Pauli <CitationRef CitationID="CR52">2012</CitationRef>). There is an estimated 800 million people involved in urban agriculture worldwide producing at least 15 % of the world’s food output. Urban and peri-urban agriculture as implemented today is not primarily a source of cash, but rather a tool to provide food security particularly for the urban poor. The percentage of poor living in cities is expected to increase from 30 % in 2000 to 50 % by 2035. As outlined in the Blue Economy report, food production in the cities must at least double in order to respond to the food and nutritional needs of the 250 million urban poor worldwide (Pauli <CitationRef CitationID="CR52">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Urban and peri-urban agriculture comprises a variety of production systems, ranging from subsistence production and processing at household level to fully commercialized agriculture. It is generally characterized by close proximity to markets, high competition for land, space confined, the use of urban resources such as organic solid wastes and wastewater, a low degree of farmer organization, a focus on perishable products, and a high degree of specialization, to name a few. By supplying perishable products such as vegetables, fresh milk and poultry products, urban agriculture complements rural agriculture and increases the efficiency of national food systems. The most important distinguishing characteristic of urban and peri-urban agriculture is that it is an integral part of the urban economic, social and ecological system: urban agriculture uses urban resources (land, labor, urban organic wastes, water), produces for urban citizens, is strongly influenced by urban conditions (policies, competition for land, urban markets and prices) and impacts the food security, poverty, ecological and health aspects of the urban system (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">3.1</InternalRef>).

          <Para TextBreak="No">In order to facilitate the formulation of policies that guide the development and sustainability of urban and peri-urban agriculture, three perspectives on urban agriculture that are not mutually exclusive but in practice, are used conjunctively to give different emphasis depending on the location and the population in question include:

                <ItemContent>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">The social perspective mainly (but not exclusively) associated with subsistence oriented types of urban agriculture that form part of the livelihood strategies of urban low income households with a focus on producing food and medicinal plants for home consumption. In addition, the family expenses on food and medicines are reduced and some cash is generated from sales of surpluses. These households seek out multiple additional income sources for their survival. Examples include home gardening, community gardening, institutional gardens at schools and hospitals, and open field farming at micro scale with low levels of investment. These systems show little direct profitability but have important social impacts such as enhanced food security, social inclusion, poverty alleviation, community development, HIV-AIDS mitigation etc.</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">The economic perspective related to market oriented types of urban agriculture which include small-scale family-based enterprises and sometimes larger scale entrepreneurial farms run by private investors or producer associations. The activities not only include food production (e.g. irrigated vegetable production, stall-fed dairy production) but also non-food products (e.g. medicinal and aromatic herbs, flowers, ornamental plants). These commercial farms are associated with small-scale and larger enterprises involved in delivery of inputs (such as seed, compost, fodder, agro-chemicals) and the processing and marketing of agricultural products. These types of urban agriculture have a more pronounced economic impact and higher profitability, but their externalities for the city and urban populations, especially those of the intensive larger scale enterprises, tend to be higher especially through risk of water and soil contamination due to intensive use of agro chemicals, health risks from use of contaminated water for irrigation and risks of animal-human disease transfers.</Para>

                <ItemContent>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">The ecological perspective that refers to types of urban agriculture that have a multifunctional character: besides provision of food and generating income they can play a role in environmental management for example, through nutrient recycling via decentralized composting and reuse of organic wastes and wastewater. They can also provide other services demanded by urban citizens: urban greening, improvement of the urban climate, keeping buffer zones and flood plains free from construction, provision of opportunities for leisure and recreational activities, storm water storage and flood prevention. In order to enable such a combination of functions, urban and peri-urban agriculture will have to adopt agro-ecological production methods, link up with eco-sanitation and decentralized sustainable waste management systems, as well as becoming part of the planning and management of parks, nature reserves and recreational services.</Para>
                </ItemContent>
              </ListItem>
            </OrderedList>
          </Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Due to the cross cutting and multi-dimensional nature of urban agriculture, policy development and action planning on urban agriculture should involve various sectors and disciplines: agriculture, health, waste management, community development, parks and nature management, among others. Moreover, urban farmers, and the CBOs and NGOs supporting them, have to be involved in the planning process. An important aspect of strategic urban planning is related to the participation of the urban poor themselves in the analysis of the situation, in the definition of priorities and in action planning and implementation. Such consultative processes would make the outcomes of policy development and action planning not only robust and comprehensive, but also accepted and sustainable.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Urban and peri-urban agriculture (in as much as it produces food), increases food availability and contributes to the overall urban food supply. Urban and peri-urban agriculture contributes to poverty alleviation both through a reduction of expenditures and through an increase of income. The income earned is usually spent on non-food items (e.g. transport, housing, school fees, and health costs) and to a lesser extent, and especially by female producers, on food items. Either way, urban and peri-urban agriculture plays a significant role in household food security. Few paid jobs are created/exist in urban and peri-urban agriculture with the exception of commercial horticultural production in peri-urban zones because farming households generally sell the products themselves. While urban and peri-urban agriculture contributes to food availability and enhances food security and nutrition to city dwellers and in some cases also generates income for urban households involved in production, processing, marketing and distribution of these foods, it also has some negative health impacts linked to poor food quality.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Cities are often unable to provide sufficient employment opportunities for the growing populations which lead to a rapid increase in urban poverty rates and food insecurity. These urban poor often lack the money to purchase food or the land to grow it. It is estimated that these individuals spend up to 60–80 % of their incomes to buy food (World Urban Forum Nanjing <CitationRef CitationID="CR66">2008</CitationRef>). For example, in recent past year’s food crisis and increased food prices and the accompanying global economic downturn reduced employment opportunities and incomes especially within urban areas. Climate change and higher incidences of natural and human-induced disasters such as excessively high floods and landslides have also caused disruptions in food-supply chains into cities further undermining food security among urban population. Sound policies that encourage and support urban agriculture are known to have substantially improved the food security and nutrition of urban poor in many developing countries. Havana in Cuba is quoted as most successful city in using urban agriculture to strengthen food security and meet nutritional needs of the urban poor. There are 300,000 backyard patios covering 2,500 ha and the number is expected to increase to half a million small gardens by 2015. More than 40 % of the households are involved in urban agriculture, including the widespread use of hydroponics securing a healthy 2,600 cal daily per capita. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the hunger that struck the nation, Cuba in general and Havana in particular succeeded within a decade in eliminating malnutrition. While over that same decade each adult Cuban lost on average 10 kg of body weight, 22 % of all new employment in the country has been created in urban and peri-urban agriculture (Pauli <CitationRef CitationID="CR52">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In view of the need to double the output of urban farming which could reduce the cost of food for the urban poor by up to 90 % by eliminating the need for transportation, warehousing and cooling, more ambitious ideas and entrepreneurship are needed. Among ambitious ideas and technologies put forward in recent years include those that convert gray water into clean water to support urban small-scale agricultural projects. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to obtain water for small gardens in urban areas by recycling sewage water to yield potable irrigation water through what is termed “clean technologies” which convert domestic wastewater into fertile irrigation water without chemicals or extra electricity through using advanced oxidation methods and technology such as solar photo-chemical oxidation. Solar photo-chemical oxidation being the niche from which the technologies are designed; all the systems perform without chemical additives and energy may be supplied entirely from the greatest untapped natural resource, the sun. Regions with abundant sun such as those in tropical Africa have great potential of using the sun technology for sustainable solutions during when domestic wastewater can be turned into safe irrigation water for subsistence gardens and vegetable patches. The sun technology offers both economic and environmental benefits and presents the first step towards keeping sewage from polluting surface and groundwater resources.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In many countries across the globe, the urban-fringe has been declared a greenbelt which is used to delimit the spread of urban area which would otherwise replace the much needed agricultural activities that enhance food security for the urban dwellers. Peri-urban agriculture has been found to have a definite and irreplaceable role in enhancing food security for many cities and large urban centers all over the world particularly where rapid rural–urban migration leads into encroachment of the city into surrounding natural ecosystems and agricultural lands. It is a challenge for both urban as well as for rural areas because producing adequate food to feed such numbers and particularly for the vulnerable groups in an urbanizing world demands combined concerted efforts to increase food supply. It also requires improved land productivity employing viable and appropriate technology to double or triple yields per hectare. Thus agricultural policies that focus on rural–urban food production linkages are called for so as to attain food and nutrition security for all sectors of the urban population. These policies need to take into consideration the impacts of these expansions to both the urban and the surrounding ecosystems. All stakeholders from the public sector, the private sector and the civil society need to work together at global, national and local levels. Policies formulated should aim to remove barriers, establish incentives and promoting capacity building of urban and peri-urban farmers and other food producers because urban and peri-urban agriculture provides effective and viable solutions to addressing food and nutrition security for urban vulnerable populations such as those in many cities in Africa. An estimated 40 % of Africa’s population lived in urban areas by 2009 (UN-HABITAT <CitationRef CitationID="CR069">2009</CitationRef>; UNDP <CitationRef CitationID="CR62">2012</CitationRef>; FAO <CitationRef CitationID="CR068">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Peri-urban agriculture contributes to food security and food safety for many urban populations across Africa as it increases the amount of fresh vegetables, fruits, milk and meat products available to people living in towns/cities. Peri-urban agriculture is viewed as sustainable agriculture across African cities and towns because it promotes energy-saving local production, limits packaging and transportation costs thus making the products affordable to a large chunk of the urban population. Since the production takes place within the city/town boundaries, the use of preservatives is reduced greatly thus increasing affordability, food safety and promotes good health for the people.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Thus, while many African cities and towns continue to largely depend on rural agriculture, peri-urban agriculture is providing significant quantities of food and improving food security of the urban poor. Vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, herbs, meat, eggs, milk and even fish are being produced in community gardens, private backyards, roof tops and vacant public lands (including at the side of roads and rail tracks). These undertakings do provide substantial family food requirements. This not only greatly improves nutrition it also allows families to spend more of their incomes on other expenses such as education and health. In addition, urban and peri-urban agriculture also generates micro-enterprises such as the production of compost, food processing and sizable incomes.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Peri-urban agriculture just like other rain fed agriculture is vulnerable to weather variability and climatic change in particular. Thus the provision of food products from the peri-urban agriculture is affected by the now inherent extreme climatic events which are becoming increasingly more frequent. These weather changes which are now increasingly being linked to climate change will most likely affect peri-urban agriculture and possibly in net positive or negative terms. The peri-urban zones are experiencing significant environmental transformations as well as increased demands to meet the ever growing urban population due to continued influx of rural people seeking better opportunities in towns and cities as the rural economies fail due to changed weather patterns and inherent climate change effects.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Earlier it was categorically stated that climate change impacts are a reality across the African continent and therefore Africa’s vulnerability has been highlighted albeit differentially distributed across the continent with differing degrees of magnitude and severity (IPCC <CitationRef CitationID="CR45">2007</CitationRef>). The analyses in these reports depicts that the future urbanization trajectory poses both challenges and opportunities because although climate change impacts have been felt and documented more explicitly in rural Africa, urban populations are also experiencing serious climate change-induced impacts. It has been documented severally that climate impacts on the population of African cities have accentuated poverty and have added a layer to their inherent development challenges. These impacts have left large chunks of the urban and peri-urban population in abject poverty effectively reducing their resilience to increased vulnerability to food insecurity.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The linkages between urban and peri-urban food systems, with the rural hinterland connected to urban systems, also play important roles in sustaining the balance of food supply, livelihoods and provision of ecosystem services along the urban–rural gradient. Where it is well managed, peri-urban agriculture has a potential for mediating climate change impacts and poverty on one hand and the provision of micro-level ecosystem services on the other, which can have a cumulative impact at the macro-scale. Recent research results highlight the role peri-urban agriculture play in enhancing food security in urban and peri-urban areas across the continent. In these studies and others on this subject, it is pointed out that integrated systems including crop-livestock systems, aquaculture-livestock-crop systems and integrated crop-forestry systems have the potential of paying off to some degree in terms of livelihood benefits to urban dwellers. As evidence of scaling up, institutions such as FAO and UNEP are now promoting ecosystem-based adaptation in African cities focusing on food production and improvement of food systems in urban and peri-urban environments (FAO <CitationRef CitationID="CR068">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">As climate change risks continue to manifest, a new layer to the existing challenges in African cities has been added. Consequently, adaptation to climate change has now become high on the agenda in combination with development. Adaptation is necessary to build resilience of cities’ response to climate change. Inland, coastal and mountainous cities face different climate risks ranging from storm surges, droughts, excessive rainfall, heat waves and cold waves. The impacts also range from flooding, storm surges, water scarcity, health impacts and landslides with social and economic implications in cities. Adaptation of cities to climate change will have to couple with development to bridge both the urban development deficit and adaptation gap. Building on early and scalable adaptation measures is paramount to enable communities, institutions, urban authorities and different actors to be prepared for probable climate change impacts able to address the inherent challenges. Rain water harvesting and small storage tanks can go a long way towards enhancing adaptation and mitigation measures (Figs. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">3.2</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">3.3</InternalRef>).

          <Para TextBreak="No">Urban and peri-urban agriculture is perceived as a locally designed but globally connected set of solutions to household food security. The extent to which urban and peri-urban agriculture is successful, particularly in enhancing food security and ecosystem services in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation largely depends on how it is perceived by city officials and how well integrated it is into other urban polices related to ecosystem management, water and wastewater management, and landscape management policies. Much of the negative sentiments surrounding the practice of urban and peri-urban agriculture stems from concerns about health risks to humans as well as the environment. For example, peri-urban agriculture incorporates the use of easily accessible resources such as waste water and groundwater which could be easily affected by sewage water disposed from the industries in urban centers which have often been found to cause microbial and heavy metal contamination due to inadequate waste treatment before disposal.

          <Heading>Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture in Southern Africa</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Urbanization is growing at an alarming rate in Southern Africa due to increasing rural–urban migration triggered by dwindling employment opportunities in rural areas and due to the ever present attractions perceived to exist in the urban areas, attractions which lure the young and able bodied population to towns. The outcome for the immigrants into the urban centers is not always what they expected; many are frustrated and fail to find a niche in the urban environment. Jobs are hard to come by particularly for those without necessary skills; most of them end up in shanty towns and informal settlements without adequate sanitation and other social facilities. Many of the migrants find themselves in the out skirts of the cities (peri-urban) or in the poorer parts of the towns and cities from where they commute to industrial sections which offer cheap unskilled jobs or from where they engage in informal businesses. Yet a small section of this population join the myriad of unemployed people wondering the streets looking for jobs or begging for alms. Those who engage in small-scale farming activities mainly engage in horticulture, growing vegetables for home use and for sale to earn some income. Urban and peri-urban agriculture including keeping of small stock such as poultry, pigs and sometimes goats/sheep is practiced not just by the unemployed, but also by low and middle income earners employed in low paying jobs. A few high income earners practice urban agriculture as a hobby or as part of their traditional practices rather than as a means to supplement their food supply or their income. Urban and peri-urban agriculture is sometimes practiced as a coping mechanism during civil strife and during critical weather conditions. Water accessibility in towns supports irrigation of small plots and backyard gardens as well as watering small number of domestic animals that are a source of fresh produce during such critical times.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Urban and peri-urban agriculture in and around cities in Southern Africa, contributes to urban food security through increased food availability and to some extent, accessibility due to short distances to the consumer markets. This contribution varies widely across the countries in Southern Africa; it also varies within a country as there are great variations among the urban population in the cities. For example in some towns and cities in Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, most families have fields where they produce staple crops such as maize, groundnuts, cassava, plantains, potatoes and beans. Horticultural crops are grown among the stable food crops or in individual small gardens alongside the fields or close to homes. In the cities of these countries, staple crops are grown in season while vegetables such as amaranth, kale, pumpkin and cow peas are grown all year round. In cities such as Harare, over a quarter of the poor practice this type of farming which contributes up to 60 % of the city’s food consumption; 80 % of urban agriculture in Harare occurs on public land and by 2012, 25 % of the city’s land was covered by small-scale farms (Pauli <CitationRef CitationID="CR52">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The type of spaces used to practice urban and peri-urban agriculture in most cities and towns in Southern Africa include around buildings, community lands and parks, waste lands areas allocated to other uses such as road peripheries and areas not suitable for building, such as flood plains, wetlands and steep slopes where both men and women grow food crops. In Harare and townships of the Cape Town Metropolitan area for example, most of the urban small-scale agricultural practitioners are women. In Dar es Salaam, women grow food for their family’s own consumption in home gardens while men and the youth grow food for the market in the open spaces. In Malawi, women do most of the work on the fields but the income is controlled by the men. Access to water, and in particular to clean water, is a major constraint for urban small-scale crop producers in most Southern African cities where there is either a lack of water or costly tap water must be used. Yet another major problem for urban food producers is theft of crops from the plots (Egal et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2003</CitationRef>)</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In many of the cities and towns in Southern Africa, local governments’ reactions to urban food production (off-plot cultivation) have general been proscriptive, partly because it spoils the modern image that many administrators want for the city and partly because urban planning and management is not structured to incorporate such activities. Hostility and repression have been frequently experienced in many towns despite the realization that urban and peri-urban agriculture has a role to play in alleviating wide spread unemployment and in meeting food requirements of the urban less privileged population. The sector is increasingly receiving appreciation for its role in contributing to good health of the people through improved nutrition and hunger alleviation which promotes more days at school and more days at work per year.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Unlike many cities in Southern Africa, Zimbabwe formulated policies way back in 1992 which allowed the carrying out of urban agriculture in Harare. This policy document concentrated on planned and organized urban agriculture. It allowed those interested in carrying out agricultural activities in the urban area to apply for permission to use designated land for the cultivation of crops. One of the aims of the policy document was to manage peri-urban areas as zones of transition that maximize the benefits of both urban and rural lifestyles. The policies targeted the minimization of negative impacts of urban agriculture the main of which was that it caused soil erosion and subsequent siltation of water supply sources. Collection of water in gardens and water ponds were seen as increasing the incidences of malaria as mosquitoes inhabited these created habitats. Other negative impacts included pollution of water infrastructure with pesticides and fertilizers as well as increasing water treatment costs.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In Harare like elsewhere in Southern African cities, agriculture is not classified as an urban activity and hence by and large, city planners do not plan for urban agriculture. Agriculture is mainly permitted in the peri-urban areas, a zone which is normally dominated by titled properties which are way beyond the reach of the poor. However, the Harare Combination Master Plan of 1992 provided for intensive agricultural smallholdings within the city and the peri-urban areas surrounding it. Both central and local governments generally acknowledged the role of urban agriculture in their decision-making structures. During the Annual Conferences of the Urban Councils Association of Zimbabwe, a resolution was made that encouraged all local authorities to recognize the role of urban and peri-urban agriculture in poverty alleviation and enhancement of urban food-security, employment creation and economic development. Although the policy framework in Zimbabwe slowly became supportive of urban and peri-urban agriculture, not much has been achieved on the ground. As a follow up, the Nyanga Declaration on Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture in Zimbabwe which was passed in 2002 like the Harare Declaration by Ministers of Local Government in Eastern and Southern Africa acknowledged that urban agriculture contributes to urban food security, poverty reduction, local economic development and sustainable urban development. The Nyanga Declaration also urges the national Government of Zimbabwe to include urban and peri-urban agriculture in its programs to alleviate poverty, NGOs and international donors to provide financial and material support for urban and peri-urban projects, and the private sector to invest in urban and peri-urban agro-businesses.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">On the other hand, the Harare Declaration of Urban and peri-urban Agriculture in Eastern and Southern Africa entered into in 2003 recognizes that although urban and peri-urban agriculture is practiced informally within the region, it already played a significant role in improving food security, health, and nutrition as well as income generation for urban dwellers. Given this fact, the declaration was passed to reinforce the urgency to develop policies and other appropriate instruments to regulate urban and peri-urban agriculture and create an enabling environment to integrate urban and peri-urban agriculture into urban economies. This declaration paved the way for the formulation of policy and legal frameworks for urban agriculture where it did not exists by then. In Tanzania, policies guiding the practicing of urban agriculture were put into operation way back during economic hardships of 1970s and 1980s (<InternalRef RefID="Sec4">Appendix 1</InternalRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In most of the cities in Southern Africa, such policies encouraging urban and peri-urban agriculture were only passed in recent years. A good example is the Zimbabwe National Environmental Draft Policy that provides strategic directions include developing and publishing guidelines on urban agriculture, assisting local authorities to plan ways to integrate and co-ordinate support for urban agriculture and establishing extension programs to promote sustainable urban and peri-urban agriculture. During 2010, the Harare Metropolitan Governor and Resident Minister, implored Harare residents to take up peri-urban farming seriously as it enhances urban food security and reduces urban poverty (<InternalRef RefID="Sec5">Appendix 2</InternalRef>). However, despite the recognition and policy support, in Zimbabwe the sector is beleaguered by numerous constraints including shortage of land and agricultural resources, serious environmental health risks and policy gaps.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In other cities such as Windhoek, where explosive urbanization rates have been registered since independence in 1990 due to rapid rural–urban migration there is no clear policy guiding the practicing of urban and peri-urban agriculture (FAO <CitationRef CitationID="CR067">2002</CitationRef>). In Windhoek, urban and peri-urban agriculture is practiced on very small scale due to environmental constraints as well as historical policy set up. Historically, intensive subsistence crop production with marketable surpluses in good rainy seasons existed around Windhoek long before the colonial era. Commercial crop production and marketing by smallholders in peri-urban areas such as Klein Windhoek (now a suburb of Windhoek) were practiced and maize, potatoes, asparagus, onions, radishes and a variety of fruit trees were grown. By 1931, local vegetable production constituted almost 42 % of Windhoek’s fresh produce market’s annual turnover. However, change and policy revisions 30 years later seriously suppressed vegetable production in peri-urban areas in Namibia as a whole. The development of homelands, up-market residential suburbs and the supply of water to mines and urban irrigation needs relegated vegetable production to the background. Consequently, since 1973 up to the present, Namibia is almost entirely dependent on South Africa for fresh vegetables and fruits save for some horticultural crops that are grown in several recently initiated green schemes scattered in the north-eastern, north-central and southern parts of the country along the Orange River. Urban and peri-urban agriculture in and around Windhoek is currently limited to minute gardens around homesteads and occasionally in dry river beds as well as a few government and donor sponsored horticultural gardens and livestock farming including game ranching as one moves further away from the city centre.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Various horticultural projects initiated in Windhoek include the donor supported Integrated Initiative in support of Urban and Peri-Urban Horticulture in Namibia (UPH) initially funded by the Belgium Government during mid-2000. The mission of the project was to contribute to food security by improving access to high quality fresh horticultural produce at household level all throughout the year; to promote employment and income for the less endowed population in the urban and peri-urban environment. Those falling in the less endowed category include urban slum dwellers, landless and marginal land farmers, previously disadvantaged group members, resource poor families, unemployed and weak/old. The status of the project during 2013 was unclear due to management issues where neither the ministry of health nor that of agriculture or that of youth is willing to assume full responsibility. Initially the success of the project heavily depended on voluntary labor input from the youth and/or those inflicted by HIV/AIDS who were the main beneficiaries; this free labor is no longer readily available after the departure of the donor. Other projects which are were functional during 2013 included a welfare intervention project aimed at enhancing the quality of life of three feed centers at Greenwell Matongo, Otjomuise and Nathaniel Maxuilili community centers located in the city’s informal settlements. The project, owned by the City of Windhoek was initiated in 2008 and revamped in 2013. It covers an area of 280 m located at Greenwell Matongo community center. In total the three community centers feed about 500 orphans and vulnerable children on a daily basis. It grows spinach, beetroots, onions, cabbages and carrots (Aloe <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2013</CitationRef>) (Figs. <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">3.4</InternalRef>, <InternalRef RefID="Fig5">3.5</InternalRef>, and <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">3.6</InternalRef>).

          <Para TextBreak="No">The other recently initiated project is in the form of an elaborate horticultural and animal project owned by a Chinese enterprise located in the per-urban fringe of the city of Windhoek; it grows a variety of vegetables and raises pigs and chicken to supply an informal market frequented by Chinese nationals working in and around the city of Windhoek. This project utilizes semi-purified water from the city’s waste water reservoir/dam. The enterprise further purifies the water to an acceptable standard before using it for irrigation and for the animals to guard against pollution risks.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Since policy revisions during late 1960s up to early 1970s which seriously suppressed vegetable production in urban and peri-urban areas in and around Windhoek, there has been no more policy formulated since then. Currently, there is no active policy on urban and peri-urban agriculture in Namibia as a whole. Although the sector is described as insignificant due to its small size, in Windhoek, it is viewed as a possible pollution threat to water and soil especially where the use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides fungicides and other chemicals is involved. Thus MAWF is planning to take steps towards determining the contribution of the sector to food security in the city. At the same time, the Ministry of Environment and Rural Development through Windhoek Greenbelt Landscape (WGBL) initiative is monitoring possible pollution threats to peri-urban agriculture activities (WELER <CitationRef CitationID="CR070">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">A number of constraints and issues have been identified as posing challenges to urban and peri-urban agriculture in Windhoek. These include the lack of access to water and other productive resources as well as competition for land and issues related to land tenure insecurity. While access to water, and in particular to clean water, is a major constraint for urban farmers in most Southern African cities, it is more pronounced in Windhoek partly due to limited access to potable water attributable to the aridity that inflicts the country as a whole and partly due to costly municipal tap water. The environmental impact of urban agriculture, the food safety concerns of using waste water and organic material and the risk of the spread of diseases and contamination by toxic pollutants are all perceived as a major concern. While the above mentioned vegetable gardens use tap water from the municipality water distribution system, others outside the reach of the municipality water distribution system depend on independent boreholes. Research carried out during 2008 pointed out the imminent pollution threat to the ground water aquifer from anthropogenic activities in Windhoek area (Mapani and Shreiber <CitationRef CitationID="CR48">2008</CitationRef>). More recent research carried out during 2012/2013 on water quality in the Windhoek Green Belt area revealed that the agricultural practitioners in the peri-urban area depend on boreholes whose water quality is threatened by Windhoek’s municipal waste water disposal system and small-scale industries within the peri-urban zone. In this study carried out at the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013 revealed that water had low dissolved oxygen, high mineral salts concentration and extremely high nutrient concentration. An analysis of soil and river sediments also showed high mineral concentrations as a result of effluent water overflow from the waste water disposal ponds and food processing firms located in the peri-urban zone. Direct effect of seepage water on the borehole mineral salts concentration was detected in the borehole of one of the agricultural entities in the study sample (WELER <CitationRef CitationID="CR070">2013</CitationRef>). Yet another major problem facing Windhoek urban agricultural practitioners is theft. An informal survey conducted in 2012 in the informal settlements revealed that theft of crops and animals is one of rampant problems worsening over time due to increasing difficulties in accessing land, clean affordable water, and widespread poverty perpetuated by high rates of unemployment.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Other problems that constrain urban and peri-urban agriculture in Windhoek include pests and disease such as corn crickets, American bollworm and aphids. The health of a range of animals kept in back yards such as goats, sheep, rabbits, chickens, turkeys, parrots and other birds is threatened by the absence of veterinary extension services for this sector. Other constraints include lack of capital and lack of information on reliable markets for surpluses due to the fact that currently most of the major markets for vegetables and fruits are dominated by South African chains of supermarkets. Moreover there is an apparent psychological preference for imported products by Namibian business people and consumers probably due to more appealing appearance and better packaging of the produce. To reverse this prejudice requires training of the producers on how to handle and package their produce so that they are attractive to the consumers. There is also need to conduct campaigns to raise awareness to encourage people to consume locally produced fresh fruits, eggs, chicken, meat and vegetables. Deliberate campaigns and policies that offer protection to locally produced products have started to emerge starting with milk and chicken.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">However, the absence of a strong and clear policy on urban and peri-urban agriculture in Windhoek and other towns in Namibia continues to curtail intensification and development of the sector. It implies that producers other than those involved in sponsored projects do not get the correct technical advice in carrying out the husbandry practices for the production of various vegetables and fruits. Knowledge of the chemicals and the quantities to be applied to various vegetables is limited and this may result in the use of the wrong chemicals as well as over dose. Once applied, information on the chemical process that might occur together with the resultant runoff is essential to assessing the impacts of the chemicals on water and soil as found out by the Windhoek Green Belt study. These findings will have an influence on the type and intensity of water treatment required. The absence of such a policy means that the quality of the produce from agricultural undertakings cannot be assured and therefore may not be fit for human consumption. The use of biodegradable chemicals to ensure that the pollution of water and soil is minimized is subject to the producers’ ability and willingness to absorb the relevant costs which would be incorporated into the prices for their produce. Due to economies of scale, their produce might then be more expensive than for that benefiting from economies of scale such as those imported from South Africa. The importers of such products enjoy the trust of well established business men and chain supermarkets. Thus without a policy that protects the local producers, their produce will continue to face unfavorable competition.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The policy intervention required here is that which encourages and creates an environment that will enable the urban/peri-urban agricultural producers to grow high value vegetables, fruits, and raise healthy poultry and small stock using sustainable and environmentally friendly technologies. The private sector including agricultural banks should offer some micro loans with relaxed payment schedule to enable the producers to attain inputs including good quality water from the municipal supply system and affordable technology for application of husbandry practices. Water harvesting techniques should be part of the training as well as tailored financing regimes. Most urban agricultural producers are not aware of the existing environmental hazards and food contamination, and the accompanying human health risks, mostly because the effects of heavy metal contamination are mainly carcinogenic and normally felt in the long-term.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The greatest challenge facing urban agriculture is for it to become an environmental benefit rather than a liability. The role of urban agriculture in ensuring food security goes beyond supply and access arguments; the environmental context in which it is practiced is very important. Similarly, even though adequate and appropriate food supply is a necessary condition for eliminating hunger, increased food supply does not automatically mean increased food security. In order to assure sustainable urban food production, key environmental elements like fresh water, arable land and other resources should be available in sufficient quantity and quality in a renewable manner. If these issues are not addressed, it will be very difficult for urban agriculture to address the food utilization component of food security. The environmental and human health challenges associated with urban agriculture show that at the current level of practice, the sustainability of urban agriculture is highly compromised. Food security does not only involve the amount and type of food available but also the element of food quality and safety.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Urban and peri-urban agriculture should be supported in Windhoek as it is a positive and appropriate way of improving urban livelihoods. The success and expansion of urban agriculture will therefore depend on the ability of policy makers, administrators and urban farmers to use integrated social, economic and environmental strategies that effectively address food security and urban poverty. To ensure that the full potential of urban agriculture in reducing food poverty is realized, the Havana example in Cuba should inform Windhoek urban planners. Urban agricultural diversification which promotes production of high-valued specialty foods such as mushrooms that require little space for production but provide good monetary returns should be encouraged. Urban agricultural producers should be capacitated to produce protein rich pulses such as soya beans in their gardens to improve the dietary quality of their households. They will be able to appreciate environmental health benefits where good practices in urban agriculture are made readily available in simplified language and demonstration examples by urban planners and health practitioners. The benefits of multi-storey gardens (MSGs) which involve growing vegetables in empty cereal bags and empty cans rather than growing them directly in the ground should be encouraged because these gardens use minimum land space and are water efficient and ideal for areas with contaminated and/or poor quality soils.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Various South African cities have also been affected by high rate of rural–urban migration due to unequal distribution of high economic activities which show that urban areas contain 88 % of the total national economic activity, (22× times that in rural areas (Geyer et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2011</CitationRef>). Among these, the city of Cape Town in the Western Cape is hosting large numbers of immigrants from rural areas in the Eastern Cape and the Northern Cape where subsistence farming is the primary economic activity and formal unemployment is high. Consequently, the city has been under great pressure to convert some of the fringe areas into agricultural islands to cater for the unemployed immigrants and at the same time meet increased food demand. The Western Cape Province which produces almost 30 % of the national agricultural output is the leading agricultural region in the country due its favorable climate. The region, particularly the city of Cape Town has been very active in promoting urban and peri-urban agriculture as a mechanism to ensure greater food security and employment among the urban poor.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Historically, urban agriculture was an essential land-use function of African settlements in South Africa where traditional settlements practiced horticulture on family plots in close proximity to the settlements while pastoral activities were practiced further afield up until the 1950s. Thus most urban settlements in South Africa were self-sustaining in food supply. During the 1950s the historic tradition of urban farming declined as commercial agriculture and rising urban incomes made urban agriculture redundant while apartheid policies and municipal by laws discouraged small-scale agriculture in and around cities. Thus contemporary urban agriculture programs are fairly recent having originated in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of anti-apartheid movements and interventions by Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">NGOs such as Abalimi Bezekhaya in Cape Town focused on recreating self-sustaining communities in the townships by forming grassroots organizations involved in urban agriculture aimed at providing subsistence and supplementary incomes for individuals and families in deprived local communities. Different from the traditional urban agriculture, the contemporary agriculture is mainly informal in nature consisting of small-scale gardening or animal husbandry, supplementing the subsistence needs of private households. Vegetables are grown on tiny tracts of land within the boundaries of the residential property or illegally in larger vacant public plots and in nature conservation areas. Poultry and small stock (goats, sheep and sometimes pigs) are kept within the gardens and graze ‘illegally’ on open land in road reserves or on public land.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In and around the city of Cape Town, illegal farming is reported to be a risky endeavor because no property rights can be established and thus no fencing can be erected to prevent theft or scavenging. The majority of impoverished urban farmers are not able to access public land other than by squatting. Although economically insignificant due to the low unit value of agricultural produce, informal urban agriculture nonetheless provides substantial income savings to poor households. Because of declining economic conditions and high unemployment rate, urban agriculture is being promoted as a solution to social problems. Accordingly, in recent years, both the National Government and the City of Cape Town Municipality have prioritized urban agriculture as a core thrust in their urban planning interventions (Geyer et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Cape Town is home to approximately 3.7 million inhabitants and nearly 40 % of the residents exist on the economic margins, including those living in more than 230 informal settlements located largely on the Cape Flats (City of Cape Town <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2011</CitationRef>). Recognizing that urban and peri-urban agriculture is contributing immensely to food security for a large chunk of the city residents, the City passed the Urban Agriculture Policy of the City of Cape Town in 2007 which formally recognizes urban agriculture as an urban land use and creates a legal framework in which land-use rights can be protected and government assistance and intervention can be legitimated. The Cape Town Spatial Development Framework (CTSDF) also plays a crucial role in integrating and aligning the planning priorities and principles of the various spheres of government spatially, thus ensuring the protection of agricultural land uses in specific areas.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The Cape Town Urban Agriculture Policy of 2007 formalizes urban agriculture as a legitimate urban land-use function, and assigns rights to urban producers who prior to 2007 practiced urban agriculture illegally. It also prescribes the responsibilities of government in protecting, facilitating and assisting urban agriculture initiatives. The policy aims to promote household food security and economic development among the poorest communities in the city. The policy prohibits the raising of animals but it specifies the creation of agricultural commonages outside urban areas for grazing purposes, which would eventually be integrated into the land reform program. The Urban Agriculture Policy details the types of assistance available to urban farmers and the criteria for qualification of assistance, with collectives receiving the most assistance and subsistence farmers and small commercial farmers receiving decreasing amounts of aid, respectively.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Thus the city of Cape Town not only provides access to vacant land but also is assisting urban gardening groups in removing debris from that land, preparing it and delivery of compost. The city also provides assistance to reallocation of those urban producers that are poorly located and therefore may cause serious health and/or environmental risks due to these locations. For example the city is planning to create new livestock kraals in the peri-urban area for the intra-urban herd owners. In its efforts to promote the provision of training and extension services to small-scale producers, the Cape Town policy on urban agriculture calls upon the services of research, training and support organizations in and around the city to provide the urban producers with training on business administration, technical skills and in marketing their produce. To enhance access to water, inputs and basic infrastructure, the municipality of Cape Town assists community garden groups with basic infrastructure (a fence, a tool shed, a water tank and hoses for irrigation) and allows them to use up to a certain amount of piped water daily free of charge.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In recent years, several projects have been undertaken in Cape Town’s urban and peri-urban areas. Examples include the Powerline Project, otherwise known as SCAGA (Siyazama Community Allotment Garden Association) and Abalimi Bezekhaya project which fortifies the lives of the people in Cape Town’s townships. In the Abalimi Bezekhaya project, the leading micro-urban agriculture model in Cape Town and almost certainly in South Africa, the very poor learn how to grow organic crops for sale and for eating at home, while conserving indigenous flora and promoting alternative technologies (Geyer et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2011</CitationRef>). The project demonstrates how urban and peri-urban agriculture has emerged as a successful strategy for the immediate relief of hunger, malnutrition and poverty. The increased availability of fresh products also improves the quality of urban diets through diversification, by adding horticultural and animal products to the basis of staple food. This allows urban dwellers to consume a more balanced diet that is not only sufficient in energy, but also in protein and micronutrients required for body growth and maintenance. Furthermore, the income raised through vending agricultural products is used to buy other consumer items such as cooking-oil and soap which improves the producers’ hygiene.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The Abalimi project involves about 1,500–3,000 residents of Gugulethu and Fezeka, where 40 % of the residents are unemployed, and poverty and hunger was rampant before the project was started during the late 1990s. The core purpose of Abalimi project is to combat poverty by growing food sustainably (and organically) both at home and in community gardens, and to further green the township areas by planting water wise indigenous trees in the schools and streets of the area. When the project was started the aim was to help people achieve subsistence from the crops grown in their gardens. Having surpassed that basic need, the project participants have gone commercial with the assistance of Harvest of Hope. Food grown at the Abalimi project goes to the families of the producers first, and to selected secondary schools in the area while residents of wealthy Cape Town suburbs form the main customer base for “Harvest of Hope,” the center’s social business branch.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The initiative has been successful save for the fact that it has registered very small profit margin. It is documented that among the approximately 3,000 urban agriculture small-scale producers supported by Cape Town NGOs such as Abalimi Bezekhaya and the 300 producers supported by the City of Cape Town’s Urban Agricultural Assistance Program have not yet emerged as independent commercial farmers and only a few are able to subsist without external support. The Abalimi Bezekhaya project with their Harvest of Hope business branch, only acquired a net profit of approximately R90 per capita per month in 2008 (Geyer et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2011</CitationRef>). However, this is not a mean achievement bearing in mind that the initial aim of urban and peri-urban agriculture was to provide food and alleviate hunger for the poor residents (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig7">3.7</InternalRef>).

          <Para TextBreak="No">The project is focused on equality for women in the program and tailoring the foods produced to fit the needs of the people in the area. At Fezeka Garden women run the project. As a whole there are very few men involved in growing community gardens on the Cape Flats. Abalimi project “subsidizes” the growers to the tune of R150 per grower per month by providing training, manure and set-up and maintenance of an irrigation system for each garden. Abalimi project also helps the growers gain access to council land and negotiates on their behalf to obtain access to water. Harvest of Hope collects the vegetables from the growers once a week and takes them back to the packaging shed to be washed and prepared for delivery (<InternalRef RefID="Sec6">Appendix 3</InternalRef>). The vegetables make up weekly organic vegetable boxes that are distributed via some of Cape Town’s southern suburbs schools.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">At the Abalimi project, farmers grow a variety of vegetables that suit the community’s needs such as spinach, cabbage, and white onions, and maybe just a few spring onions (Stofile <CitationRef CitationID="CR59">2013</CitationRef>). They also grow some that are in high demand by their main consumers such as leak and rhubarb. It is a story of hope for everyone who believes in the power of small, community-owned agricultural plots. It took many years to get to the point where black people in South Africa accepted that organic crop growing was different and valuable. No one, except one or two really believed that reliable, adequate money could be made from micro-farming on tiny bits of wasteland, until money started pouring into people’s accounts (Stofile <CitationRef CitationID="CR59">2013</CitationRef>; <InternalRef RefID="Sec7">Appendix 4</InternalRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Other initiatives are emerging; during June 2013, an NGO known as Avalon’s initiated a new project on the expansion of organic urban farming in Cape Town with the aim of strengthening the concept initiated by the Abalimi project in addressing problems of food insecurity and unemployment growing exponentially in Cape Town and other urban areas in South Africa. Using a threefold approach, Avalon’s objective is to firmly anchor urban agriculture in South African cities, starting with Cape Town. The objective of the project known as Family Strengthening Programs of SOS Children’s Villages South Africa is similar to those of the Abalimi Bezekhaya project where the participating families get lessons in creating and maintaining organic vegetable gardens to feed their families and sell the surplus thus becoming semi-commercial producers. The project envisages the establishment of vocational training center for the successful semi-commercial producers who would be trained on how to manage larger plots of land and bring the marketing and sale of their products to a higher level converting them into fully qualified producers. The project, planned to run initially for 6 years, is funded by the COmON Foundation with contributions from the regional Western Cape Ministry of Agriculture, the organic compost company, Reliance, and the growers themselves. Avalon is working on this project together with SOS Children’s Villages and the local urban agriculture organization Abalimi. It is hoped that the project will create more than 500 permanent jobs in the city’s agricultural sector and result in more than six million improved meals a year (Avalon <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2013</CitationRef>).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Another recent initiative utilizes a previously abandoned piece of land used as a bowling green until 2012 when the piece of land was taken over by volunteers who plant, nurture, and grow a variety of horticultural crops and hosts a public market once a week. Known as the Oranjezicht City Farm, it is considered as the first in a project that will grow into 20 city farms throughout Cape Town. Through education, design and vegetable gardening, the project hopes that it will act as a catalyst for skills development, education about food and environmental issues, and a showcase for what can be done with unused or under-utilized public green spaces in the city. Crops grown in the farm include hedges of herbs such as thyme, lavender and rosemary which protect the vegetable beds from the wind (<InternalRef RefID="Sec8">Appendix 5</InternalRef>). The farm uses fresh water springs that run through the area to irrigate the plants. The cluster of springs is known to have provided perennial fresh water to local pastoralists (Khoekhoen) and used to irrigate vegetables and fruit trees that supplied fresh food supplies for passing ships during the seventeenth century up to the turn of the twentieth century.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The Oranjezicht City Farm, a neighborhood non-profit farm project celebrating local food, culture and community through urban agriculture is composed of community of adults and younger folk working together to engage in small-scale organic food production. The vision of the project is to improve under-utilized public green spaces by creating demonstration gardens for hands-on community-wide food gardening education, thereby increasing access to fresh vegetables. Oranjezicht farm aims to re-connect the Oranjezicht neighborhood and the rest of Cape Town to build social cohesion across communities, to develop skills among the unemployed, to educate residents and their children and others about food, environmental and related issues, to beautify public spaces and to champion unused or under-utilized green spaces in the city. It is envisaged that the farm will serve the purpose of increasing access to nutritious fresh vegetables for the community, to increase the number of organic gardeners and hence lead to more outdoor activities and healthier lifestyles and build capacity and skills of youth and adults seeking work in urban food production. The farm also strives to promote connections and foster relationships between and among individuals, garden communities, and NGO’s throughout South Africa. A well laid out farm in an affluent part of Cape Town, it produces a range of horticultural crops (<InternalRef RefID="Sec8">Appendix 5</InternalRef>).</Para>

          <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">On the whole, it should be born in mind that urban and peri-urban agriculture has many benefits as well as negative effects emanating from being located within or so close to the city. The benefits include increased food supply particularly for the poor and vulnerable section of the urban population, hunger and poverty alleviation, solving widespread unemployment and increased food security for the underprivileged sector of the population. The negative effects emanate from the fact that the poor sections of urban centers lack affordable adequate clean water and that those who cannot afford paying for water resort to using waste water to support their agricultural activities. Cities’ waste products including waste-water and industrial and sold waste gets disposed off in the urban fringe and thus pose imminent pollution threats to products from the agricultural activities located within the urban-fringe zone. Many backyard gardens within the city boundaries may also make use of domestic waste water posing possible pollution threats to crop products as well as meat products such as that from poultry pens and fish ponds utilizing such water. This is the case in particular for infectious diseases transmitted through contact of human beings with animals during production processes, or ingestion of contaminated water or animal products.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In Southern Africa, some poor parts of the cities and their periphery zones such as those in Windhoek and northern Mozambique, poor hygiene abounds; latrines are not customarily utilized so that human waste get washed into seasonal rivers and permanent streams by rain surface flow. The vegetable and other agricultural undertakings which depend on contaminated stream water for irrigation and watering livestock, pollution and food contamination is a high threat to food quality and food safety. Similarly, despite the fact that urban agriculture in Tanzania is practiced in a generally favorable political and legal context, in Dar es Salaam environmental contamination of crops was reported around latrines, pathways and industrial wastewater outlets (Egal et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2003</CitationRef>). This calls for policy makers to take cognizance of such threats and work in close collaboration with environmental health specialists who would look into the conditions pertaining to food production and processing in the urban and peri-urban zones. Multidisciplinary teams that include physical land planners and environmental health specialists should determine appropriate locations of urban and peri-urban fields and plots. Municipalities and local government authorities ought to carry out health and hygiene campaigns and awareness building among urban and peri-urban agricultural producers and residents.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Furthermore, policy makers ought to take full cognizance of advantages of urban and peri-urban agriculture and should encourage collaboration and research as a supportive measure towards the urban and peri-urban agriculturalists so that they produce safe and nutrient-rich products for both home consumption and city markets. Policy makers should incorporate the needs and benefits of urban and peri-urban agriculture into physical urban planning including land tenure, water availability and drainage characteristics. Among other roles, urban researchers should look into viability of food production in the urban environment and advise the city planners accordingly. The growers should also be involved during the planning phase. By and large, all concerned stakeholders should participate in policy formulation to ensure that food produced in urban and peri-urban areas is safe to eat and that which gets processed is distributed efficiently while observing health standards to ensure its safety.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">By formally accepting urban and peri-urban agriculture as a viable urban land use activity urban policy makers throughout the region would effectively contribute to the development of safe and sustainable urban agriculture. By passing legislation including policies and by-laws that control and guarantee and safeguard land tenure and security of agricultural land use, they will strengthen and increase the productivity and economic viability of urban agriculture. Policies should take into account the need to facilitate access of urban agricultural practitioners to training, technical advice, and credit that would support growth of undertakings including small business enterprises. Required training should include the prevention and/or reduction of health and environmental risks associated with urban and peri-urban agriculture as well as wise use of waste water, pesticides, fertilizers and organic waste.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Quality control along the entire food chain from production to consumption is essential so that urban consumers can have access to safe and healthy foods. Ensuring good quality of urban agriculture products would also help producers obtain good prices for their products. Information from surveyed literature reveal that many countries in Southern Africa do not have urban agricultural services with the exception of two towns in Tanzania (Dar es Salaam and Dodoma) and one in Mozambique (Maputo) and Cape Town (South Africa) where non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have emerged as the effective supporters of urban and peri-urban agricultural practitioners.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Equally as essential is advise to the poor and less educated on foods that are rich in nutrients and can adequately supplement the common diet, such as fast-growing crops and, where appropriate, small livestock, which should be culturally acceptable and easy to market. Concerned institutions should ensure that there is no contamination of foods during and after production and that there is consumer protection through the establishment of food control systems. Links of nutrition needs of urban consumers with the urban and peri-urban producers would ensure sustainability and security of livelihoods of poor households. Required also is coordination among the various sectors involved, from the urban, local level up to municipalities and national level.</Para>

            <Heading>Appendix 1: Legal and Policy Aspects of Urban Agriculture in Tanzania</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Urban agriculture (UA) in Tanzania is practiced in a generally favorable political and legal context. At the national level, during the 1970s and 1980s, the government, faced with a poor economy, issued policies encouraging people to undertake urban agriculture. This was for urban dwellers to attain food self-sufficiency, to grow food in order to offset sky-rocketing inflation. Government and political leaders time and again told urban dwellers to raise livestock and produce their food in their backyards and other open space. Policies behind this included <Emphasis Type="Italic">Siasa in Kilimo</Emphasis> (Politics is Agriculture) of 1972 and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Kilimo cha Umwagiliaji</Emphasis> (Irrigated Agriculture) of 1974, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Kilimo cha Kufa na Kupona</Emphasis> (Agriculture for Life and Death) of 1974/75 and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Mvua za Kwanza ni Zakupandia</Emphasis> (First Rains are for Planting) of 1974/75. Others included the National Economic Survival Programme (NESP) of 1981/82, the National Food Strategy of 1982, the National Livestock Policy (NLP) of 1983, the National Agricultural Policy (NAP) of 1983, and the National Economic Recovery Programme (ERP) of 1986–1990.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">At the ministerial level, urban agriculture has been partly encouraged by agricultural extension officers who offer non-formal education to urban dwellers. In a bid to encourage urban dwellers to produce own food, the government set up an urban agriculture extension service in the 1970s under the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS). Currently, MAFS uses its urban-based Agriculture/Livestock Extension Agents (ALEAs) who work in towns to promote the raising of livestock and growing of crops. ALEAs visit urban dwellers and impart modern skills and knowledge (non-formal education) about agriculture so that the farmers’ production will increase. It was in the early 1980s when government policies of encouraging urban agriculture, especially livestock keeping, started to have negative effects on the operations of most urban councils and the physical urban environment. So it was time to review the existing municipal bylaws regarding farming in town.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The first urban bylaws regulating the growing of crops and raising of livestock in urban centers were enacted by the British colonial authorities in 1928 under Rule 16 CAP. 101 titled bylaws for regulation of cultivation and keeping of animals in urban areas. These bylaws had three main objectives: (1) to prohibit people of African descent to grow crops and raise livestock in urban areas; (2) to prevent urban agricultural activities in urban areas, because it was thought to increase the presence of malaria-causing mosquitoes, especially crops taller than one meter; and (3) to maintain a cleaner urban environment and sustain urban aesthetics by preventing people of African descent from growing crops in most of the towns’ open spaces.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">After independence in 1961, most of these bylaws became moribund. Later, however, most towns and municipal councils found it necessary to revive the bylaws so as to regulate urban agriculture for the smooth running of towns. The essence of these bylaws is that growing crops or raising animals is allowed, be it under certain conditions. In Tanzanian towns, bylaws on crop cultivation make a distinction between areas where growing crops is completely prohibited and where it is permitted. Growing crops is also not permitted within a distance of fourteen meters from road banks. As for the river valley, however, crop cultivation is not allowed within a distance of fifteen meters from the river banks. The cultivation of annual crops is unrestrictedly allowed in these areas. For permanent crops, however, a written permission from the Municipal Director is needed. Other bylaws regulate the proper ways in which crops have to be cultivated, including for instance use of machinery, planting time, use of inputs, weeding, use of certified seeds, planting on slopes, as well as how to act in case of plant pests or diseases. Other bylaws stipulate the penalties on not adhering to these regulations, including fines, imprisonment and destruction of crops.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">However, although these bylaws exist and clearly stipulate the penalties for defaulters, they are rarely implemented. For instance, it is common to see crops of all varieties planted in all municipal administrative wards, road reserves, riverbanks, public open spaces including children playgrounds, and surveyed plots, rendering the bylaws ‘toothless.’ In towns, bylaws on livestock keeping define “animals” as cattle, donkeys, goats, horses, mules, pigs and sheep. In other words, small livestock like improved chicken, local chicken, ducks, rabbits and turkeys, most of which are now raised in urban areas, are left out. Most town Councils’ bylaws stipulates that they “shall earmark certain areas to be known as “specified areas” within the urban area for the purpose of keeping animals [and] along which to move an animal or animals and permits shall be issued by the Councils in respect of animals authorized in the Urban Areas”. Yet, the bylaws do not specify the numbers and types of animals that urban dwellers are allowed to raise in different density areas.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Bylaws forbid keeping animals outside “a building, structure or enclosure”; hence, keeping animals in free range is prohibited. Moreover, according to bylaws do not allow animals to be kept “in a building or part of such building that is used for human habitation”. Yet, people do keep improved chicken, goats, sheep and local chicken in their houses. On the other hand, chicken (local and improved) are not defined as “animals” in these bylaws. Animals can only be moved with special permission from the Council. Most urban dwellers keep animals without having a permit. Bylaws which require urban dwellers to remove manure, liquid filth, and other animal waste are never enforced. The fact that there are many senior government and ruling party officials among the livestock keepers who break the bylaws with impunity, is probably the best assurance for most other livestock keepers that they will not be punished whenever they break the law. The National Human Settlements Development Policy of 2000 of the Ministry of Lands and Human Settlement Development says the following regarding Urban Agriculture:<UnorderedList Mark="None">

                    <Emphasis Type="Bold">Urban agriculture</Emphasis> exists in most urban areas both in the developed and developing countries. As an economic activity, it provides income and employment opportunities to the urban populations, and a reliable supplementary source of food supply to urban dwellers at affordable prices. As a land use, well-planned urban agriculture creates a pleasant greenery scene.</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">
                    <Emphasis Type="Bold">Issue</Emphasis>. Although urban agriculture is considered an important component in sustainable development, improperly practiced urban agriculture conflicts with other urban land uses and leads to land degradation, water pollution, and is a threat to health and safety.</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">
                    <Emphasis Type="Bold">Policy statement</Emphasis>. The government shall: (i) designate special areas within planning areas whereby people will be granted legal rights to engage themselves in agricultural activities; (ii) continue to regulate and research on the conduct of urban agriculture and will ensure that it does not disrupt planned urban development; (iii) review existing laws to facilitate planned urban agriculture; and (iv) facilitate the construction of appropriate infrastructure to mitigate/prevent land degradation, water pollution, and health and safety hazards in areas whereby urban agriculture is permitted.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Thus, the legal context is somewhat confusing for the urban farmers. The national government pursued a generally favorable policy and even tried to encourage people during periods of severe economic recession. Even, though farming in town is generally accepted, the bylaws at the local level pose many restrictions to the practice. Many urban farmers appear not to know what is allowed and what is not. On the other hand, despite these regulations, enforcement is sparingly done and discriminatory in nature (the elite are less affected), councils lack funds and personnel to reach sprawling and sometimes unplanned urban areas.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">He acknowledged that for years, farming has not been regarded as an urban land-use and local authorities have been quick to cut down crops grown by residents on open spaces within cities and towns. He said although local authorities’ by-laws on urban farming have not changed, most municipal authorities have realized the importance of farming for urban residents. They are now allocating land at the periphery of urban areas to town and city residents intending to grow different food crops. He gave the example of Mr and Mrs Edgar Makowe of Tynwald in Harare who have been practicing peri- urban farming for some years and it had significantly contributed to the upkeep of their family. He told them last season the Makowes planted maize on four hectares of land and they managed to harvest a yield that is as good as any if not better than that harvested by communal farmers. On the back of the good harvest, the Makowes invited agricultural experts to come and share their expertise to encourage neighbors and friends to take this type of farming seriously. Speaking at the occasion, Governor David Karimanzira urged other urban dwellers to emulate what the Makowes have done and help eradicate poverty in the country. Mr and Mrs Makowe said they are now looking to farming as a viable option of sustaining their family and supplementing the family income. Speaking at the same event, Ivan Craig an agricultural expert with a local seed manufacturing concern also noted that peri-urban agriculture is one of the several tools for making productive use of urban open spaces, treating and recovering urban waste and managing fresh water resources more effectively. He also stressed the importance of knowing the soil type and using the appropriate seed. Agricultural experts also encouraged people practicing peri-urban agriculture to plant trees in open spaces they are utilizing for peri urban purposes so as to conserve the environment. Last year, government allocated 60.000 ha of land for urban agriculture in Harare in a bid to eradicate poverty in urban areas.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Tuesday mornings are always busy for the staff of Abalimi Bezekhaya, an urban agriculture project operating in the sprawling townships of Cape Town, South Africa. Each Tuesday, peppers, eggplants, cabbages, beets, and the like are collected from dozens of community gardens to be sorted, boxed and driven to 25 pickup points around the city. On a particular Tuesday in February though, there is a problem. The list of recipes distributed with each box includes one that calls for leeks, but leeks are nowhere to be found. “What’s the crisis today?” asks Rob Small, the co-director and founder of Abalimi Bezekhaya (“farmers of the home” in the native Xhosa language). “I think it might be this,” he says, pointing to the leek-less boxes. Despite daily hurdles, Small and his staff are successfully running a hybrid social enterprise that provides training, financial support, and food security to small farmers. The roughly 15,000 people Abalimi reaches—3,000 farmers, with an average of five family members—all live in the historically disenfranchised Cape Flats townships, where residents have faced high crime rates, a lack of opportunity, and a 30 % to 40 % unemployment rate since the days of apartheid.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Abalimi’s profitable social business, Harvest of Hope, relies on a community-supported agriculture model that provides customers (who pay in advance) a box of fresh, organically grown produce harvested from community gardens each week. Abalimi’s main objective is securing access to “local fresh food and nutrition security” through a combination of subsistence plots and community gardens. The organization is addressing three of South Africa’s most chronic problems—unemployment, racial disempowerment, and nutritional inequality—with a blend of entrepreneurship, philanthropy, and organic compost. “These days, to be charitable means you’re making people weak,” Small says, referring to the negative stigma attached to nonprofits. “Social businesses are conducted with the interest of the whole at heart, while the individual is honored and recognized within that.”</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Liziwe Stofile, who lives in the township of Khayelitsha, trains Abalimi’s new farmers. She explains that in her home province of the Eastern Cape, where many Cape Flats’ residents are from, few Africans grow or eat vegetables like peppers, chard, or green beans. Instead, they grow traditional subsistence crops like potatoes, squash and mealies (corn), which offer less nutritional diversity than what she eats today. “What is happening now,” says Vatiswa Dunjana, another trainer and field worker living in the township of Nyanga, “is we are learning something about the healthy food: what to cook, how not to overcook, what veggies you can eat raw while picking in the garden—it is boosting our bodies.”</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">While the food grown by Abalimi’s farmers goes to their own families first, the main customer base for Harvest of Hope’s commercial produce is not the residents of nearby townships. Instead, the main customers are the white residents of wealthy Cape Town suburbs. It is, however, common for township residents to buy one or two bunches of vegetables from nearby community gardens. Stofile says these small-scale transactions are subtly changing the tastes of residents. “Farmers are growing a variety of vegetables that suit the community’s needs. The community doesn’t want to buy leeks, green onions, baby marrows. They want to buy spinach, cabbage, and white onions, and maybe just a few spring onions when they are making their <Emphasis Type="Italic">imifino</Emphasis>,” Stofile says, referring to a green vegetable stew commonly prepared in South Africa.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Small encourages this trade in the townships and hopes it will expand in the future into local farmers markets. But he says Abalimi plans to stick with the CSA model, even if township residents can’t afford it yet. “The CSA model is the most conscious, viable and fair form of social business on the planet,” Small says. “It is 1,000 % more equitable and fair to the farmers.” When Small talks about the challenges of running Abalimi, rarely does he mention things like poor soil quality, early frosts, or controlling insects without the use of pesticides. He says his biggest challenges have little to do with cultivating organic fruits and vegetables, and everything to do with the mindsets of the people he works with. “Go back [in time] and maybe you’ll find yourself in a clan, in a tribal grouping maybe under a king or queen. Here in Africa, that group consciousness is very recent. You can encounter it still,” Small says. “Relationship in Africa is far more important than results.”</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Small recounts a recent incident in which vegetables that required refrigeration prior to delivery were repeatedly left just outside the refrigerator door, causing them to wilt. Despite being instructed numerous times, the staff repeated the same mistake for several weeks. Small believes the staff did this to show their collective dissatisfaction with some aspect of management but, he said, upsetting the client only served to “damag[e] the ground they walk on.” “The biggest challenge is people’s ability to conceive of potential and future possibilities,” he says. Recently, Small stepped down as the day-to-day director of Abalimi and handed the responsibility over to a formidable Xhosa woman referred to as ‘Mama Kaba,’ a longtime staff member with considerable experience and clout. Small was eager to step down and said that the decision was in part an attempt to reverse the perception of Abalimi as a “black empowerment project led by white people.”</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In the townships where Abalimi operates, it’s not uncommon for women to be leaders in the community and in charge of social projects. This is reflected in the core staff of Abalimi, which is mostly female. “From the beginning, we took [Mama Kaba] as the one who is in charge because she’s an older woman and she’s got more experience,” Stofile says. “The reason that women take over most of the community gardens is because they want to take vegetables home to feed their children. The men only want to make money.” While he wants more young men to get involved to reap the benefits of small farming, Small doesn’t see the women-led movement as a problem. “The mothers and grandmothers tend to be more honest and values driven, thus development really happens, rather than smoke and mirrors,” Small says.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Abalimi trains individuals in their target group—the disadvantaged, poor, and unemployed who “don’t fit to the western European model for getting jobs”—to what Small calls the livelihood stage—more than subsistence farming, but not large scale enough to be fully commercial. “[The livelihood stage] is the stage which governments and development agencies worldwide generally don’t understand,” Small says. “They try to leapfrog people from subsistence to commercial.” Small recalls a time when he struggled to convince farmers that they could sell the excess produce from their subsistence plots for money. He describes jumping over fences into small plots to scavenge the surplus harvest that would otherwise be left to spoil. “It took many years to get to the point where black people in South Africa accepted that organic was different and valuable,” Small said. “No one, except one or two of us [at Abalimi], really believed that reliable, adequate money could be made from micro-farming on tiny bits of wasteland, until they saw it pouring into people’s accounts.”</Para>
