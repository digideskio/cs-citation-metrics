              <Para TextBreak="No">Population-based data are increasingly used to elucidate the burden of cancer worldwide. Incidence and mortality data from regional and national cancer registries should allow researchers to monitor trends and disparities in cancer occurrence, survival, and mortality in populations and subgroups of the population and to evaluate the effectiveness of screening for cancers amenable to early detection and treatment. Given that the primary purpose of screening is to reduce the number of deaths attributable to cancer, cancer mortality is assumed to be the most important indicator of the effectiveness of screening and the most basic measure of progress against cancer (Hakama et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">2008</CitationRef>; Jatoi and Miller <CitationRef CitationID="CR55">2003</CitationRef>). In setting screening policy, the deaths saved by screening, however, must be weighed against any adverse effects of screening resulting from over identifying or over treating cases, as well as monetary costs.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Recent studies on cancer in the United States (U.S.) and Europe show an overall decline in cancer mortality in recent years; however the magnitude of the decline and current mortality rates are variable across Europe and between the U.S. and other high-income European countries (Jemal et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR56">2010</CitationRef>; La Vecchia et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR64">2010</CitationRef>; Crimmins et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2010</CitationRef>). Declines in screened cancers including breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers have played important roles in the reduction in overall cancer mortality (Jemal et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR56">2010</CitationRef>; Karim-Kos et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR61">2008</CitationRef>; Boyle and Ferlay <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2005b</CitationRef>; Baade et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2004</CitationRef>; Botha et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2003</CitationRef>; Quinn et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR98">2003</CitationRef>). Screening, along with improved diagnostic methods, and therapeutic advances are thought to be responsible for site-­specific cancer declines, however the extent to which each of these factors is responsible for the declines remains largely unknown and controversial.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">This paper compares screening policy, screening uptake, and recent trends in cancer incidence and mortality rates in the U.S. and high-income European countries for cancers of the breast, prostate, colon, rectum, and anus among persons aged 50 years and older. As the approaches to screening in the U.S. and Europe have been similar in some, but different in many respects, the comparison allows the outcomes of key differences to be evaluated. We examine mortality trends in two time periods, 1980–1989 and 1990–2005, before and after screening became more widespread, to identify differences in the rate of decline in site-specific cancer deaths across countries with different uptakes of cancer screening. We find that in general, greater declines in mortality coincide with higher uptake of screening, however our results should be interpreted with caution. To conclude, we highlight the challenges and critical issues in this field of research.</Para>

              <Heading>Cancer Screening</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The aim of cancer screening is to reduce cancer mortality through regular and systematic examinations of asymptomatic persons, so that cancers are detected at earlier stages when they are more responsive to appropriate treatments, thus minimizing the loss of life as well as the social and financial burden of cancer (von Karsa et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR126">2008</CitationRef>). While many of the technologies used for screening are also used for the diagnosis of cancer among those with symptoms, screening refers to the use of tests and exams among those who are not symptomatic as part of preventative health care. There are risks, as well as benefits, associated with screening and early detection. While screening can identify cancers that will become symptomatic and can cause death, screening also identifies slow-growing and indolent tumors that may result in the diagnosis and treatment of a “cancer” that would otherwise not go on to cause symptoms or death if undetected or untreated (Welch and Black <CitationRef CitationID="CR131">2010</CitationRef>). It is important to note that the term “cancer” represents a continuum of disease, ranging from noninvasive to invasive carcinoma, and screening techniques may detect both of these disease entities as well as noncancerous benign tumors and lesions (Nelson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR78">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Public health policies related to cancer screening have been integrated into preventive health care in many countries; however screening guidelines for particular cancers vary considerably across countries. Screening policies and methods, while generally based on scientific analysis and evidence-based recommendations, can also reflect economic considerations. In Europe, screening guidelines and programs are strictly based on findings from randomized controlled trials (RCT) that have demonstrated a significant reduction in cancer mortality as a result of screening (Hakama et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">2008</CitationRef>). In the U.S., screening guidelines have also been based on observational and diagnostic accuracy studies, rather than relying only on experimental evidence from RCTs. For instance, the recommendation for widespread use of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test in the U.S. as a screening tool for prostate cancer prior to supporting results from randomized trials serves as an example of intuitive screening practices.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Despite widespread use of screening, optimal screening policy remains controversial. For example, in the U.S., revised recommendations by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2009, to increase the age at which routine screening should begin from 40 to 50 and reduce the frequency of routine mammograms, conflicted with long-standing recommendations by other medical groups and sparked a great deal of controversy. While RCTs are generally considered the gold standard for determining a screening modality’s effectiveness in reducing mortality from a particular cancer, conflicting and inconclusive results among RCTs have generated much debate among the medical community and have created a great deal of confusion among both medical practitioners and the public as to when the benefits of screening outweigh the risk of adverse effects as a result of screening. Another source of confusion is that the mortality benefit of screening not only depends on the type of cancer, but also on age, adding to the difficulty in setting universal sets of screening recommendations.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In the following section we discuss the screening modalities generally used to detect breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer and their effectiveness in reducing cancer-specific mortality. These are major cancers, with breast cancer responsible for 16.5% of all cancer deaths among women, prostate cancer responsible for 9.2% of all cancer deaths among men, and colorectal cancer responsible for 11.2% of all cancer deaths among men and women in the U.S. and Europe in 2008 (Ferlay et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR38">2010</CitationRef>). Each of these cancers is amenable to screening but each has different issues related to screening effectiveness in reducing cancer-specific mortality and appropriate screening policy.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec3">
                <Heading>Breast Cancer</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Breast cancer has an asymptomatic phase that can be identified with various screening techniques including screen film and digital mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound. Our discussion will focus on mammography. For women at high-risk for breast cancer, MRI may be used as a screening modality (Nelson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR78">2009</CitationRef>; Warner et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR129">2011</CitationRef>), however there are currently no studies investigating its effectiveness in reducing breast cancer mortality. Numerous organizations continue to recommend clinical breast exams as a complementary examination to mammography screening, however self examination is no longer recommended by most organizations (Anees et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">2007</CitationRef>). In two RCTs, no mortality benefit to breast self-examination was found (Semiglazov et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR109">2003</CitationRef>; Thomas et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR118">1997</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Screen-film mammography gained widespread use after its introduction in the late 1980s and is the most extensively studied screening modality. When an abnormal mammographic finding is identified, additional imaging and biopsy for tissue sampling may be recommended to further discriminate cancerous and noncancerous conditions and to classify the lesion in more detail.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Mammography screening guidelines are generally based on the findings from eight randomized trials conducted in the U.S., Sweden, United Kingdom, and Canada. Findings from these trials show mammography to be effective in reducing mortality from breast cancer by 20 to 35% among average-risk women ages 50–69 (Nystrom et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR80">2002</CitationRef>; Shapiro <CitationRef CitationID="CR110">1994</CitationRef>). It is estimated that 465 women need to be screened (every 24–33 months), for 7 years in order to save one life over 20 years (Tabar et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR117">2004</CitationRef>). This estimate translates to 1,499 mammographic examinations needed to prevent one death among average-risk women in the 50–69 age range. Recent research on the effectiveness of mammograms among younger women, those between age 40 and 50, indicates that mammography is much less efficient in this age range (Quanstrum and Hayward <CitationRef CitationID="CR96">2010</CitationRef>). It is estimated that more than 1,900 women between the ages of 40 and 49 years need to be screened in order to save one life from breast cancer during 11 years of follow-up (Nelson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR78">2009</CitationRef>). If women in this age range are receiving annual mammograms, this estimate translates to 20,944 mammographic examinations needed to prevent one death, indicating that each mammogram has less than a 1 in 20,000 chance of preventing a death from breast cancer among average-risk women in the 40–49 age range (Quanstrum and Hayward <CitationRef CitationID="CR96">2010</CitationRef>; Goldberg <CitationRef CitationID="CR42">2010</CitationRef>). It is this difference in effectiveness that has resulted in the changing of recommendations for mammography screening among women younger than 50.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">There are critical evidence gaps on the effectiveness of mammography in decreasing breast cancer mortality among average-risk women aged 75 years and older (Galit et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2007</CitationRef>). A randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of mammographic screening in women over age 74 has not been conducted. However, data from two cohort studies (McCarthy et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR71">2000</CitationRef>; McPherson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR72">2002</CitationRef>) and one nested case-control study (van Dijck et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR124">1994</CitationRef>) suggest that mammography screening among women aged 75 years and older with a reasonable estimated life expectancy may be associated with identification of earlier-stage disease and lower breast cancer mortality (Galit et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The potential harms associated with mammography screening include pain during the procedure, along with anxiety and distress, although these effects are usually transient (Lerman et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR66">1991</CitationRef>; Ekeberg et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">2001</CitationRef>; Lampic et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR65">2001</CitationRef>). More serious harms include false-positive results that lead to further diagnostic evaluation and unnecessary treatment. The specificity of a single mammographic examination is 94–97%, indicating that 3–6% of women who do not have cancer undergo further diagnostic procedures (Humphrey et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR54">2002</CitationRef>). The percentage of women experiencing one false-positive result over time, however, is much higher due to the cumulative risk of multiple examinations from routine screenings (Elmore et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">1998</CitationRef>; Croswell et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2009</CitationRef>). It is estimated that for every one life saved from breast cancer, approximately 2,000 false-positive mammograms will occur among screened women between the ages of 40 and 49 years (Nelson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR78">2009</CitationRef>). Approximately 400 false-positive mammograms will occur among screened women between the ages of 60–69 years. Furthermore, there is a 1–3% increase in the relative risk of developing breast cancer due to the small dose of ionizing radiation received during mammography (Nelson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR78">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Digital rectal examination and the PSA test are the two methods used to screen for prostate cancer. PSA testing was developed in the mid 1980s primarily for physicians to monitor the progression of confirmed prostate cancers before and after cancer treatment. However, by the early 1990s, the PSA test, performed in conjunction with a digital rectal examination, had become the primary method for prostate cancer screening in the U.S. (Cookson <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">2001</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The test measures the amount of prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by cells in the prostate gland, in the bloodstream. Elevated levels are associated with tumors in the gland, as well as common non-cancerous conditions such as prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlargement of the prostate). PSA levels also tend to increase with age. Test results do not distinguish between cancerous tumors and benign prostate conditions; a biopsy is needed for distinction and classification. The common threshold for biopsy is 4 ng/ml, however varying cut-off values have been adopted to increase the test’s sensitivity and specificity (Bangma et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2007</CitationRef>; Holmström et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR49">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">PSA testing combined with digital rectal examination is simple, minimally invasive, and readily available. Screening for prostate cancer can result in the detection of small volume, low grade, and organ confined prostate tumors diagnosed at an early stage (Catalona et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">1991</CitationRef>; Postma et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR90">2006</CitationRef>; Draisma et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2006</CitationRef>). Diagnosis of early stage virulent tumors is important and can save lives. However, most tumors in the prostate grow slowly, are unlikely to spread, and do not become symptomatic or clinically significant for many years or even decades. For this reason, most men with prostate cancer are more likely to die with prostate cancer than from it (Sakr et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR104">1994</CitationRef>; Brawley et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">1998</CitationRef>). Based on postmortem studies, over 30% of men who died in their seventh decade with no known history of prostate cancer had detectable malignant cancer in the prostate at autopsy (Sanchez-Chapado et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR105">2003</CitationRef>; Soos et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR112">2005</CitationRef>; Hass et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR47">2007</CitationRef>). Because of the test’s high rate of identifying tumors that would not cause mortality, there is concern over the adverse effects associated with additional diagnostic and treatment procedures. Biopsy and treatment following a positive diagnosis can result in morbidity and significant declines in quality of life due to the risks of erectile dysfunction and incontinence (Raaijmakers et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR99">2002</CitationRef>; Potosky et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR91">2000</CitationRef>; Wilt et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR133">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Scientific evidence of a mortality benefit from prostate screening was sought in two landmark randomized controlled trials: the U.S.-based Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC). Despite the assumption that the two trials would clarify the effects of prostate cancer screening, findings of the studies led to different conclusions. The American randomized trial reported no evidence of a mortality benefit to screening with up to 10 years of follow-­up (Andriole et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2009</CitationRef>), while the European trial reported a 20% decline in mortality after 9 years of follow-up (Schroder et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR107">2009</CitationRef>). The European trial indicated that 1,410 men would need to be screened and 48 additional cases would need to be treated to prevent one death from prostate cancer (Schroder et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR107">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The disparity in results is attributed to differences in the protocol, execution, and contamination levels between the two trials (Pinsky et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR88">2010</CitationRef>; La Rochelle and Amling <CitationRef CitationID="CR63">2010</CitationRef>). Because screening for prostate cancer has become a regular part of American health care, PSA tests were being received by approximately 50% of the men in the control group of the American trial. In Europe, the PSA test is less commonly used as a screening tool for prostate cancer. Contamination was projected to be 20% in the design stage of the trial, thus the European trial was less affected in its control arm by screening behavior outside of the study. Nonetheless, high usage of the intervention in the control group reduces the effective sample size and statistical power of each study (Pinsky et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR88">2010</CitationRef>; Boyle and Brawley <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2009</CitationRef>), weakening ability to reach a valid conclusion about the mortality benefit from screening. Preston (<CitationRef CitationID="CR93">2009</CitationRef>) interprets the results from these two trials to indicate that the United States would gain no mortality benefit by expanding PSA testing beyond its already high screening levels, whereas European countries would benefit from an expansion. The debate over prostate cancer screening continues in light of these findings.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Several screening test modalities are available for colorectal cancer, including fecal occult blood test (FOBt), sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy (Atkin <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2003</CitationRef>). Studies suggest that colorectal cancer has an asymptomatic phase when benign adenomatous polyps develop into early, localized cancers, before further progressing into advanced and potentially fatal cancers. The average time for an adenoma (pre-­cancerous polyp) to progress to carcinoma is approximately 10 years, and tests that detect adenomas, such as endoscopy, can be offered less frequently. It is important to note that 90% of adenomas remain benign, and screening for them can result in overtreatment. For the 10% of adenomas that do develop into carcinoma, it takes approximately 2–3 years for an asymptomatic cancer to become symptomatic, thus screen-detected colorectal cancers are typically diagnosed 2–3 years earlier than clinically detected cancers (Atkin <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2003</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The FOBt is the most extensively studied screening modality and has been shown in three randomized trials to reduce colorectal cancer mortality by 20–33% (Mandel et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR69">1999</CitationRef>; Kronborg et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR62">1996</CitationRef>; Jørgensen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR59">2002</CitationRef>; Hardcastle et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">1996</CitationRef>). The FOBt (home-test kit commonly used) is a noninvasive, inexpensive test that involves placing consecutive stool samples onto cards and mailing them to a lab for processing. Investigation of the colon by endoscopy is generally recommended for positive results. Proponents of the FOBt argue that the test is a cost-effective screening modality by reducing the number of endoscopies administered, although endoscopic examinations have greater sensitivity in detecting adenomatous polyps and early cancers compared to stool tests when considered as a single test (Whitlock et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR132">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Colonoscopic screening methods are considered to be the gold-standard due to greater sensitivity for detecting adenomas and carcinomas in both the distal and proximal colon, and the ability to remove pathological lesions within a single examination (Zavoral et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR136">2009</CitationRef>). Despite these advantages, there is currently no published data from multicenter RCTs on the efficacy of colonoscopy screening in reducing colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. However, findings from a controlled, multicenter randomized study on the efficacy of a once-only flexible sigmoidoscopy screen, which can also remove pathological lesions and detect adenomas and carcinomas of the rectum and sigmoid colon where approximately two-thirds of adenomas and cancers are located, suggest that this examination can reduce colorectal cancer incidence by 23% and reduce mortality by 31%, when offered only once between ages 55 and 64 years (Atkin et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2010</CitationRef>). Based on the data from this trial, 489 people need to be screened by sigmoidoscopy to prevent one death from colorectal cancer after a median of 11 years of follow-up. These findings suggest that sigmoidoscopy may be a more cost-effective population-based screening modality than colonoscopy, because it is a relatively safe procedure that does not require anesthetics and necessitates less time and preparation for patients (Loeve et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR68">2000</CitationRef>). Although evidence suggests that population-based screening for colorectal cancer is effective, there is still debate over which screening modality is appropriate (Hawkes and Cunningham <CitationRef CitationID="CR48">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">The establishment of organized population-based cancer screening programs in the European Union has distinguished European screening practices from that of the U.S., where cancer screening is predominantly opportunistic. In the U.S., screening behaviors and practices generally depend on individual level circumstances such as one’s awareness of, decision to seek, and/or access to care and health insurance. Organized screening programs in Europe, however, operate under a standardized system of care in which nationally implemented guidelines chosen by government or health departments define the target population to be invited, the screening method to be used, and the screening interval followed for particular types of cancers (Miles et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR77">2004</CitationRef>). With over 50 nationwide screening programs for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer, the Europe Union leads the way in population-based screening; however in the first implementation report in 2003, less than half of the minimum recommended numbers of screenings took place in the EU each year and more than half of the annual volume of screening examinations (59%) were administered outside of population-based programs (von Karsa et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR126">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Significant variation in screening test utilization between the United States and Europe and across European countries is observed (Howard et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR52">2009</CitationRef>; Stock and Brenner <CitationRef CitationID="CR115">2010</CitationRef>; Preston and Ho <CitationRef CitationID="CR94">2010</CitationRef>). Cancer screening in the U.S. is among the highest compared to other countries, with a generally higher prevalence of screening at both younger and older ages (Preston and Ho <CitationRef CitationID="CR94">2010</CitationRef>; Howard et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR52">2009</CitationRef>; Cutler <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2008</CitationRef>). Recent analyses of the risks and benefits of screening have questioned the health and mortality benefits accruing to the aggressive screening practices at older ages in the U.S., resulting in the recommendations against routine screening for breast cancer in women older than 70 years (USPSTF <CitationRef CitationID="CR123">2009</CitationRef>), for colorectal cancer in adults older than 75 years (USPSTF <CitationRef CitationID="CR121">2008a</CitationRef>), and for prostate cancer in men older than 75 years (USPSTF <CitationRef CitationID="CR122">2008b</CitationRef>). Although age-based limits for routine screenings are relatively new in the U.S., many European countries have targeted persons within a specified age range and have used age-based limits since the implementation of population-based screening programs in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Shapiro et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR111">1998</CitationRef>; Miles et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR77">2004</CitationRef>). It is important to note that age-based limits for both breast and colorectal cancer screening vary considerably across Europe, and persons outside the age range can request to continue screening in a number of countries (von Karsa et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR126">2008</CitationRef>; NHSSP <CitationRef CitationID="CR79">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">Screening mammography guidelines in the United States differ from those in Europe. The Council of the European Union recommends biannual mammography screening for women between the ages 50–69 years of age. Conversely, most major U.S. medical organizations and government agencies such as the American Cancer Society, American College of Radiology, and the American Medical Association, have recommend annual mammography screening for women aged 40 years and older; however, the US Preventative Services Task Force and the American College of Preventative Medicine recently updated their guidelines to include annual or biannual screening for women between the ages of 50–69, resembling European guidelines.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Comparing data from the United States and nine European countries, in 2004, the U.S. had the highest percentage (77.7%) of women between the ages 50–64 reporting that they received a mammogram in the past two years (Howard et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR52">2009</CitationRef>). Although mammography use declines with age, there is greater variation in the percentage of women screened at older ages and the U.S. has by far the highest screening percentage with almost two-thirds of American women aged 75 and over receiving a mammogram (63.1%), as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">9.1</InternalRef>. Screening prevalence among European women aged 75 years and older ranged from 9.0% for Spain, to 25.7% for Austria. The severe drop in mammography use from ages 50–64 to 75 years and older among European women reflects age-based limits in mammography test use in many European countries.

Austria was the only country to have a higher prevalence of PSA test use than the U.S. among men ages 50–64 and 75 years and older, whereas the majority of European countries have a much lower screening prevalence. Austria’s higher screening prevalence is likely to be attributed to prostate screening trials, such as in Tyrol, where intensive PSA screening began in 1992 (Micheli et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR76">2003</CitationRef>). Lower cancer screening prevalence in the rest of the European countries analyzed can be attributed to the European Union’s strong sentiment against prostate cancer screening. Higher prevalence of test use amongst older respondents probably reflects the use of PSA as a diagnostic test as well as a screening test.

                  <Para TextBreak="No">There are marked differences in the testing modalities recommended in the U.S. and Europe. Since the mid 1990s, U.S. guidelines have recommended the use of fecal occult blood tests annually in addition to endoscopic examinations (sigmoidoscopy every 5 years or colonoscopy every 10 years) for average-risk adults aged 50 years and older. Over the last decade, colonoscopy has become the most common screening modality in the U.S. (Chen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2008</CitationRef>). Substantial increases in its use were noted after Medicare coverage was expanded in 2001 to include colonoscopy for screening purposes for average-risk individuals (Harewood and Lieberman <CitationRef CitationID="CR45">2004</CitationRef>). The fecal occult blood test is the only test recommended by the Council of the European Union and is the most frequently applied method in Europe, whereas colonoscopy is seldom used as a primary screening test (Zavoral et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR136">2009</CitationRef>; Benson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2007</CitationRef>). Many European countries have been reluctant to promote endoscopic screening due to the lack of evidence from randomized trials on their efficacy in reducing colorectal cancer incidence and mortality (Atkin <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2003</CitationRef>; Pox et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR92">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">The prevalence of colorectal cancer test use among European countries has only been reported recently (Stock et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR116">2010</CitationRef>; Stock and Brenner <CitationRef CitationID="CR115">2010</CitationRef>; Howard et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR52">2009</CitationRef>). Howard and colleagues (<CitationRef CitationID="CR52">2009</CitationRef>) report colorectal cancer screening rates based on receipt of the FOBt or endoscopy combined for the U.S. and Europe, in which European rates, with the exception of Austria, were lower than U.S. rates across younger and older age groups. In this section, we highlight the findings by Stock and Brenner (<CitationRef CitationID="CR115">2010</CitationRef>), who report prevalence estimates by screening modality among adults aged 50 years and over in Europe based on the 2004 SHARE data. Prevalence estimates for the United States are based on 2005 NHIS data (American Cancer Society <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Prevalence estimates of FOBt and endoscopy utilization among Europeans aged 50 years and older in the last 10 years were generally less than 20%, as shown in Figs. <InternalRef RefID="Fig3">9.3</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">9.4</InternalRef>. Austria, France and Germany reported prevalence rates above 20% for both men and women across screening modalities. Although the Council of the European Union only recommends the FOBt for colorectal cancer screening, prevalence estimates were higher for endoscopy than for the FOBt in approximately half of the European countries analyzed. There were few significant gender differences in screening prevalence (Stock and Brenner <CitationRef CitationID="CR115">2010</CitationRef>).

              <Para TextBreak="No">Cancer disparities and the burden of cancer worldwide have been highlighted due to the availability of comparable regional and national-level data from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) and the World Health Organization (<CitationRef CitationID="CR137">WHO</CitationRef>) Mortality Database (La Vecchia et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR64">2010</CitationRef>; Ferlay et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2004</CitationRef>; Quinn and Babb <CitationRef CitationID="CR97">2002</CitationRef>; Parkin et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR86">2001</CitationRef>). Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Annual Dataset (CI5<Emphasis Type="Italic">plus</Emphasis>) provides crude and age-standardized annual incidence based on data from national and regional cancer registries (Ferlay et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR38">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Incidence and mortality rates are based on the number of new or primary cancer cases and deaths occurring in a given time period in a specified population and expressed per 100,000 persons per year. To increase comparability, incidence and mortality rates are adjusted to the World standard population (Segi <CitationRef CitationID="CR108">1960</CitationRef>). Anatomical sites examined include malignant neoplasms of the breast (ICD code C50), prostate (ICD code C61), and colon, rectosigmoid junction, rectum, anus, and anal canal (ICD code C18–21).</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Screening practices have had large influences on cancer diagnosis. As indicated above, screening will increase the diagnosis of more localized, curable cancers, as well as identify clinically insignificant tumors that would never be identified without screening (Bangma et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2007</CitationRef>; Thompson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR119">2004</CitationRef>). Numerous studies have shown changes in cancer incidence that parallel major changes in screening test utilization (Mettlin <CitationRef CitationID="CR75">2000</CitationRef>; Glass et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR41">2007</CitationRef>; Jørgensen and Gøtzsche <CitationRef CitationID="CR58">2009</CitationRef>). Marked increases in incidence are observed for particular cancers after the introduction of screening. The estimation of overdiagnosis in relation to initiation of screening is complex (Paci and Duffy <CitationRef CitationID="CR83">2005</CitationRef>; Duffy et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">2008</CitationRef>) and varies by cancer site (Welch and Black <CitationRef CitationID="CR131">2010</CitationRef>). In the U.S., overdiagnosis of prostate cancer due to PSA screening is estimated to be 15–37%, depending on race (Etzioni et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">2002</CitationRef>). Estimates of overdiagnosis of breast cancer based on the analysis of incidence rates before and after the implementation of breast screening programs or trials range from less than 1–33% (Paci et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR84">2004</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR85">2006</CitationRef>; Duffy et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">2005</CitationRef>; Olsen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR81">2006</CitationRef>; Zackrisson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR135">2006</CitationRef>; Jørgensen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR60">2009</CitationRef>), and differ by age and outcome (in situ breast vs. invasive breast cancer). We examine time trends in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer incidence based on data from regional and national cancer registries across a number of countries. Both levels and trends in cancer incidence vary widely between the U.S. and Europe, and across Europe as well.</Para>

                <Heading>Breast Cancer Incidence</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">From 1980, there was a gradual increase in the reported incidence of breast cancer among women aged 50 years and older in the U.S. and Europe, as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig5">9.5</InternalRef>. From 1980 to 2002, breast cancer incidence rates are higher in the U.S. compared to most European countries analyzed. Higher prevalence of mammography screening in the U.S. relative to other countries may have resulted in the higher rates of diagnosed breast cancer. The increase in incidence rates over time may reflect the progressive adoption of mammography beginning in the 1980s (Glass et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR41">2007</CitationRef>). It is also possible that some of the increase in breast cancer incidence in the United Sates up through about 2002 may have resulted from widespread use of hormone replacement therapy for potential chronic disease prevention among menopausal women beginning in the 1980s (Glass et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR41">2007</CitationRef>). The difference in oral hormone therapy use may also contribute to some of the disparities in breast cancer incidence between American and European women (Stefanick <CitationRef CitationID="CR113">2005</CitationRef>).

                <Para TextBreak="No">Since the 1990s, many European countries have experienced a gradual increase in the reported incidence of prostate cancer among men aged 50 years and older, as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig6">9.6</InternalRef>. However, in the U.S. and Austria (Tyrol), prostate cancer incidence rates rose rapidly in the early 1990s and then declined in the late 1990s. Despite these declines, recorded prostate cancer incidence rates remained substantially higher in the U.S. and Austria compared to other European countries. This pattern parallels the introduction and widespread use of the PSA test as a screening tool in the U.S. (Quinn and Babb <CitationRef CitationID="CR97">2002</CitationRef>), and the implementation of a mass prostate screening program in Tyrol, Austria (Horninger et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR51">1999</CitationRef>). The widespread ­implementation of prostate cancer screening has not only affected trends in prostate cancer incidence, but has also affected the features of the identified cases, such as tumor stage and grade (Rietbergen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR101">1999</CitationRef>; Stephenson <CitationRef CitationID="CR114">1998</CitationRef>).

                <Para TextBreak="No">From 1980 to 2002, reported colon cancer incidence among men and women aged 50 years and older remained stable or gradually increased in the European countries examined, whereas reported colon cancer incidence decreased among both men and women in the U.S. over this period (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig7">9.7</InternalRef>). It is interesting that in spite of increased screening for colorectal cancer in the U.S. (Chen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2008</CitationRef>; CDC <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2011</CitationRef>), the incidence decreased. It is possible that there have been real declines in incidence as screening prevalence has increased. One difference between screening for colorectal cancers and other cancers is that the removal of polyps that occurs with colorectal screening may reduce the incidence of cancer as well as mortality from diagnosed cancers (Rabeneck et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR100">2010</CitationRef>). Progressive adoption of colonoscopy in the U.S. is consistent with declining colon cancer incidence trends.

              <Para TextBreak="No">The links between differences in survival rates and changes is survival rates over time, however, must be interpreted with caution due to the effects of screening activities (Farrow et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR36">1996</CitationRef>). By detecting tumors and precancerous lesions before symptoms are present, the disease may be more treatable and have a better prognosis. However, screening may also lead to the detection of both benign and pre-­malignant tumors that will never become symptomatic or progress further. Second, there may also be cases where earlier detection of the disease through screening has no effect on disease outcome, but leads to an artificial increase in individual survival time from diagnosis to death simply as a result of an earlier diagnosis. Slower-­growing tumors have a greater likelihood of being detected at preclinical stages by periodic screening, leading to a length bias in survival rates (Walter and Stitt <CitationRef CitationID="CR127">1987</CitationRef>; Prorok et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR95">1990</CitationRef>). It is probable that higher or improved survival rates result from greater detection of latent, slow-growing tumors that are already associated with a greater likelihood of survival rather than reductions in mortality from tumors of the same size and lethality as those identified before screening. In many respects, trends in cancer mortality may provide a better indication of the effectiveness of cancer control measures than trends in cancer incidence or cancer survival rates.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">The examination of population-based cancer mortality trends and retrospective analyses of screening prevalence have been used to infer the extent of the possible public health benefit of population-based screening. In the past two decades, declines in breast, prostate and colorectal cancer mortality have been observed in the U.S. and Europe (Preston and Ho <CitationRef CitationID="CR94">2010</CitationRef>; Rohde et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR102">2009</CitationRef>; Karim-Kos et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR61">2008</CitationRef>; Collin et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">2008</CitationRef>; Coleman et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2008</CitationRef>; Bouchardy et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">2008</CitationRef>; Verdecchia et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR125">2007</CitationRef>; Ward et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR128">2006</CitationRef>; Boyle and Ferlay <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2005a</CitationRef>; Levi et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR67">2005</CitationRef>; Baade et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2004</CitationRef>; Tyczynski et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR120">2004</CitationRef>; Hsing et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR53">2000</CitationRef>; Pito et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR89">2000</CitationRef>). Recent declines in cancer-specific mortality in countries with high uptakes of screening tests may be interpreted as some evidence of the effectiveness of screening, however ecological analyses should be interpreted with caution. There are numerous other factors that can affect mortality, including treatment. There is also a lag time between when a cancer is identified and when a death is prevented, making it difficult to relate screening to cancer mortality trends.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">From 1980 to 1989, significant increases in breast cancer mortality rates are observed in most countries except for Sweden, where a significant decrease in mortality is observed (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">9.2</InternalRef>). After rising mortality rates throughout the 1980s, significant declines in breast cancer mortality rates are observed in all countries from 1990 to 2005 (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig8">9.8</InternalRef>). In this time period, breast cancer mortality rates decreased by an average annual percentage of −0.7 to −2.5% per year, as shown in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">9.2</InternalRef>. The U.S. and U.K. experienced the fastest rates of decline from 1990 to 2005, −2.2 and −2.5% per year, respectively, and experienced the highest overall decline in age-standardized breast cancer deaths of approximately 26% from 1980 to 2005.

                <Para TextBreak="No">The United States and U.K., which experienced the fastest rates of decline and the highest overall decline in breast cancer mortality, have the highest screening prevalence among the group of countries analyzed here. Although self-reported data on current mammography use were not available for the U.K., screening prevalence for mammography among women aged 50–70 years old in 2006/2007 is estimated to be approximately 74% (Patnick <CitationRef CitationID="CR87">2009</CitationRef>). However, from 1990 to 2005, countries with low screening prevalence, such as Denmark and Germany, experienced rates of decline in breast cancer mortality similar to rates experienced by countries with a much higher screening prevalence, such as France. This finding would seem to indicate that screening has played some role in the declines in breast cancer but that other factors, such as improved treatment using adjuvant multiagent chemotherapy and tamoxifen, may have also been important (Mariotto et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR70">2002</CitationRef>; Harlan et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR46">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Between 1980 and 1989, significant increases in prostate cancer mortality rates are observed for all countries except Sweden (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab3">9.3</InternalRef>). After rising mortality rates from prostate cancer occur throughout the 1980s, significant declines in mortality rates are observed in most countries from 1990 to 2005, as shown in Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig9">9.9</InternalRef>. In this period, mortality rates decreased by an average annual change of −0.9 to –3.2% per year among men aged 50 years and older (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab3">9.3</InternalRef>). The U.S. experienced the fastest rate of decline of −3.2% per year from 1990 to 2005 and the highest mortality reduction in age-standardized prostate cancer rates from 1980 to 2005, 30.4%.

                <Para TextBreak="No">Countries with the highest screening prevalence, such as the U.S., Austria, France, and Germany, experienced the fastest rates of decline in prostate cancer mortality among men aged 50 years and older from 1990 to 2005 and the greatest overall mortality change from 1980 to 2005. In contrast, countries with the lowest screening prevalence, such as Denmark and the U.K., have experienced little or no decline in prostate cancer mortality from 1990 to 2005 and have actually experienced an increase in overall prostate cancer mortality from 1980 to 2005. Thus, these data suggest that national trends in prostate cancer mortality have been significantly affected by the use of screening.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">From 1980 to 1989, some countries experienced significant increases in colorectal cancer mortality, while other countries experienced stable or small declines in mortality among men (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab4">9.4</InternalRef>). In this time period, most countries, however, experienced significant declines in colorectal cancer among women. American men and women experienced the fastest decline in mortality from 1980 to 1989, −1.0 and −1.3% per year, respectively. From 1990 to 2005, most countries experienced declines in colorectal cancer mortality among both men and women (Figs. <InternalRef RefID="Fig10">9.10</InternalRef> and <InternalRef RefID="Fig11">9.11</InternalRef>). American men and women continued to experience one of the fastest mortality declines, of −2.4 and −2.5% per year, throughout this period, and experienced the highest overall decline in age-standardized colorectal cancer deaths between 1980 and 2005, 37.6% and 41.0%, respectively (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab4">9.4</InternalRef>). The U.K. and Austria experienced the fastest decline in colorectal cancer mortality −2.7% per year among women. Spain and Italy were the only countries to experience a rise in colorectal cancer mortality rates from 1980 to 2005, especially among men. From 1980 to 2005, mortality rates among Spanish women increased by 33%, while rates increased by an alarming 95% among Spanish men.

              <Para TextBreak="No">The reduction in cancer death rates over the past two decades in the U.S. and other high-income European countries appears to be a persuasive argument in support of screening and early detection. Issues surrounding over diagnosis and over treatment remain at the forefront of developing policies for population screening (Elmore et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2005</CitationRef>; Welch <CitationRef CitationID="CR130">2009</CitationRef>; Jørgensen and Gøtzsche <CitationRef CitationID="CR58">2009</CitationRef>; Esserman et al <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">2009</CitationRef>). Greater emphasis is now placed on quantifying the overall risk-benefit profile of a screening modality in order to determine its value for population screening.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In addition, it is hard to separate the effect of screening from other factors including improved diagnosis through technological advances and development and implementation of more effective therapy (Etzioni et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR33">1999</CitationRef>; Mariotto et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR70">2002</CitationRef>; Meng et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR74">2002</CitationRef>). The recent declines in site-specific cancer mortality can only be attributed to screening if screening is followed by appropriate diagnoses, effective treatment, and follow-up care. The unique impact of screening on cancer mortality is difficult to establish because advances in treatment known to alter disease prognosis occurred concurrently with the widespread use of screening modalities. For example, the advent of nerve-sparing surgical techniques in the early 1980s, followed by innovations in radiotherapy and hormonal treatment, led to curative treatment options, often multimodal, for patients diagnosed with varying stages of cancers in the prostate and breast (Etzioni and Feuer <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">2008</CitationRef>; Nelson et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR78">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Treatment patterns and access to cancer care also differ markedly across countries. Vast inequalities in resources for cancer care are reported in Europe including the number of medical oncology facilities and specialists in each country (ESMO <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">2006</CitationRef>). For example, higher numbers of medical oncology facilities per million of the population are reported in Northern Europe than in the Mediterranean countries (ESMO <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">2006</CitationRef>). National and regional variations in the provision of radiotherapy have also been documented (Bentzen et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2005</CitationRef>). The consequence of inadequate access to radiotherapy is increased waiting times for treatment, which is likely to have detrimental effects on treatment outcomes (Rutqvist <CitationRef CitationID="CR103">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The quality and availability of cancer prevention and treatment modalities and resulting cancer survival have been linked to macro-economic determinants, such as gross domestic product (GDP), the total public expenditure on health (TPEH), and total national expenditure on health (TNEH) (Micheli et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR76">2003</CitationRef>). European countries with high TNEH tended to have high cancer survival rates compared to countries with low TNEH. Based on this analysis, it is not surprising that cancer survival rates are among the highest in the U.S., which has the highest total health expenditure among all high-income countries (OECD <CitationRef CitationID="CR82">2006</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Countries with the highest screening prevalence have generally experienced faster declines in mortality from 1990 to 2005, while countries with lower screening prevalence have experienced increases or little change in cancer mortality in this period. The results in this study reveal that despite higher reported incidence rates for most cancers analyzed, Americans currently have among the lowest breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer mortality rates and experienced some of the fastest declines in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer mortality rates from 1990 to 2005, compared to their European counterparts. However, this was not the case in the 1980s.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The reduction of cancer death rates over the past two decades in the U.S. and other high-income European countries among persons aged 50 years and older appears to be a persuasive argument in support of screening and early detection. The complexity of the relationship between mortality trends and screening prevalence lies within the countries in the middle. Some countries with moderate prevalence of screening have experienced significant declines in cancer-specific mortality rates comparable to those with the highest prevalence of screening.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The comparison of cancer incidence and mortality rates between regions or countries with different screening uptakes plays an important role in the current debate on the value of population screening (Etzioni and Feuer <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">2008</CitationRef>; Mettlin <CitationRef CitationID="CR75">2000</CitationRef>). Despite their limitations, ecological or geographical studies are useful for monitoring the effectiveness of population interventions, such as screening initiatives and programs. In the absence of conclusive findings from randomized trials, these studies help generate hypotheses about the public health benefit of cancer screening and highlight disparities in the burden of cancer across populations. Continued monitoring of incidence and mortality trends, along with prevention and treatment practices, may increase our understanding of the relationship between screening and mortality reduction.</Para>
