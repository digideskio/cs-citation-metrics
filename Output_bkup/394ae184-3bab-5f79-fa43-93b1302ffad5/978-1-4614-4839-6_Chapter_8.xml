Much is focused on the expenditures often referred to as “direct costs,” such as those related to premiums, disability, physician appointments, specialists, prescriptions, and emergency care.

              <Para TextBreak="No">The aim of this chapter is to take a systematic approach to identifying the problems with ­absenteeism and presenteeism in the workplace. The first part of this chapter provides an overview of the methods used to measure and quantify the costs and productivity impacts of absenteeism and presenteeism. The second part of the chapter focuses on the various illnesses, injuries, health behaviors, and ­occupational factors that contribute to absenteeism and presenteeism. Lastly, the prevention and intervention strategies that various employers have developed and implemented are discussed to highlight the proactive efforts put forth to reduce absenteeism and presenteeism in the workplace.</Para>

              <Heading>Quantitative Measurement Approaches to Assess the Effects of Absenteeism and Presenteeism in the Workplace</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The concepts of absenteeism and presenteeism are easily defined, such that absenteeism is simply the absence of a worker due to personal illness or the illness of a dependent. Presenteeism occurs when a worker is ill but continues to work and often results in a loss of productivity, which is noted as the amount of work performed within a given timeframe, as well as a loss in work quality. Ultimately, absenteeism and presenteeism are important not only because of the direct impact they have on worker health and well-being but also because they represent the two sources of productivity losses that are directly attributable to worker illness. From an economic perspective, the productivity losses related to absenteeism and presenteeism contribute both to lost revenue for employers and also potentially to lost wages and decreased earning potential for workers. This is especially true in cases where the employer provides either limited or no sick leave (Samuel &amp; Wilson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008108">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">These concepts of absenteeism and presenteeism are easy to understand. However, in order to study the topic scientifically, they need to be operationally defined in a way that allows them to be measured quantitatively. This means that absenteeism and presenteeism must be measured in a way that can be expressed by numeric values, such as the number of hours of work missed due to absence within a given period of time, or the number of hours of decreased productivity due to working while ill. In addition to measuring the amount of work missed due to absence or the amount of productivity lost due to presenteeism, there is also much interest in translating these overall productivity losses into monetary terms. This section provides a general overview of the methods used to measure absenteeism and presenteeism quantitatively, and reviews a variety of common approaches to assessing their economic impact.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec00083">
                <Heading>Measuring Absenteeism and Presenteeism</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Many approaches to the measurement of absenteeism and presenteeism have been developed over the last few decades. Typically, these concepts are measured using self-report survey instruments, which ask workers a series of questions regarding their recent work performance, the number of days missed due to illness, their ability to meet various performance and productivity standards and so on. Aside from questionnaires, both concepts can be measured from actual employee records of attendance and job productivity. Of course, many employers do not have sufficient processes set up to capture all of the relevant information related to absenteeism and presenteeism. While most employers have the ability to track employee absence, many do not have adequate systems in place to measure all of the relevant aspects of productivity that could be affected by presenteeism. Likewise, most employers do not capture information about specific health conditions that ultimately result in absence and/or productivity loss due to presenteeism. The remainder of this section focuses specifically on the various self-report questionnaires that are used to measure absenteeism and presenteeism, which are followed by an overview of the various methods for assessing their economic impact.</Para>
                <Section3 ID="Sec00084">
                  <Heading>General Instruments</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Currently, there are six commonly used measurement instruments for evaluating the effects of illness on absenteeism and presenteeism in general: (1) the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI), (2) the Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ), (3) the Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ), (4) the Health and Work Questionnaire (HWQ), (5) the Endicott Work Productivity Scale (EWPS), and (6) the Health and Labor Questionnaire (HLQ) (Lofland, Pizzi, &amp; Frick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000874">2004</CitationRef>; Prasad, Wahlquist, Shikiar, &amp; Shih, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000896">2004</CitationRef>; Schultz &amp; Edington, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008113">2007</CitationRef>). Each of these instruments asks workers to respond to a number of questions regarding their ability to effectively operate at home, work, school, and social settings in relation to their current health status (Prasad et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000896">2004</CitationRef>). Based on the responses to these questions, researchers are then able to estimate the extent of impairment at work for each worker.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">In 1993, Reilly Associates, a health, life quality, and economic research and consulting firm, ­developed the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire</Emphasis> (WPAI) to measure the effect of health on productivity at work and outside of work (Lofland et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000874">2004</CitationRef>; Prasad et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000896">2004</CitationRef>; Reilly, Zbrozek, &amp; Dukes, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008102">1993</CitationRef>; Schultz &amp; Edington, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008113">2007</CitationRef>). Several versions of the WPAI exist, including disease-specific versions, which are covered later in this section. The general version, typically referred to as WPAI-GH, has six questions and measures effects of both absenteeism and presenteeism. The first question verifies the employment status of the respondent, followed by three questions regarding the hours missed due to health problems, hours missed due to other reasons and total hours worked in the last 7 days. The remaining two questions ask the respondent to indicate the extent to which health problems have impacted their ability to do work and other daily activities outside of work in the past 7 days on a 11-point scale, where 0 is “no impact” and 10 is “completely prevented the respondent from working.” Given the few number of questions in the survey, it is easy to administer and requires very little time to complete. A number of studies have established the validity and reliability of the WPAI (Prasad et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000896">2004</CitationRef>). The strengths of the WPAI are its (1) simplicity and low burden of administration, (2) high degree of validity and reliability, (3) versatility in extending to specific diseases, and (4) applicability to economic assessment.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Work Limitations Questionnaire</Emphasis> (WLQ) was initially developed based on patients with a ­variety of chronic illnesses, including asthma, Crohn’s disease, liver disease, depression, and anxiety (Lerner et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000868">2001</CitationRef>; Lofland et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000874">2004</CitationRef>; Prasad et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000896">2004</CitationRef>). It has since been tested on additional illness populations, and found to be a valid and reliable instrument for measuring absenteeism and presenteeism. The WLQ consists of 25 items covering four job demand categories: (1) Time Management, (2) Physical Requirements, (3) Mental/Interpersonal, and (4) Output. Respondents are asked to rate each of the 25 items in relation to the extent to which their health condition has limited their ability to perform their job in either the last 2 weeks or the last 4 weeks. All items are asked on a 5-point Likert scale, where 1  =  “Limited None of the Time” and 5  =  “Limited All of the Time.” A key strength of the WLQ is that it measures impacts to specific job performance skill areas, whereas most instruments measure only overall job performance.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health and Work Performance Questionnaire</Emphasis> (HPQ) was first published in 2003 by ­researchers at Harvard Medical School, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) (Kessler et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000857">2004</CitationRef>; Prasad et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000896">2004</CitationRef>). The HPQ contains 24 items relating to hours missed from work, workplace accidents, diminished productivity, usual productivity and productivity of other workers within the last 4 weeks, as well as basic demographic information. Each item is measured on an 11-point Likert scale, where 0  =  “Worst Performance” and 10  =  “Top Performance.” The HPQ has been tested within a number of occupational populations, including airline reservation agents, telecommunication customer service representatives, railroad engineers and automobile manufacturing executives, and has been found to have a high degree of validity and reliability in measuring absenteeism and presenteeism across many health conditions (Kessler et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000857">2004</CitationRef>). The strengths of the HPQ are (1) its relatively high validity, reliability, and generalizability and (2) its applicability to assessing economic impacts. The potential limitations of this instrument, however, are that (1) it may not predict white-collar job productivity particularly well and (2) it does not distinguish between different aspects of productivity (Prasad et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000896">2004</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health and Work Questionnaire</Emphasis> (HWQ) assesses 24 items, measured on a 10-point Likert scale, relating to the employees’ perception of their own view of their work, coworker’s view of their work and their supervisor’s view of their work (Shikiar, Halpern, Rentz, &amp; Khan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008114">2004</CitationRef>). Specific work-related dimensions include the following: amount of work, work efficiency, work quality, restlessness at work, boredom at work, concentration at work, exhaustion at work, and work/environment satisfaction, among others. The HWQ has been tested within a population of airline reservation agents to assess the impact of smoking on productivity and absence in which the researchers compared results from the questionnaire to objective measures of absence and productivity supplied by the employer. The results of this study showed that the HWQ was successful primarily in predicting absenteeism, but not worker productivity (Prasad et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000896">2004</CitationRef>; Shikiar et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008114">2004</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Endicott Work Productivity Scale</Emphasis> (EWPS) instrument was designed to measure both absenteeism and presenteeism related to any disease or disorder (Endicott &amp; Nee, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000831">1997</CitationRef>; Lofland et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000874">2004</CitationRef>; Prasad et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000896">2004</CitationRef>). The questionnaire consists of 25 items, with each item measured on a Likert scale from 1  =  “Never Affected” to 5  =  “Almost Always Affected.” The items ask the respondents to indicate to what extent their condition has affected their work productivity within the last week. The EWPS has been tested for validity and reliability, but only for the condition of depression. However, with respect to depression, the EWPS has been shown to have a high degree of validity and reliability.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Similar to the WLQ, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health and Labor Questionnaire</Emphasis> (HLQ) measures four modules of ­activity, including (1) work absenteeism, (2) work presenteeism, (3) household activity, and (4) impediments to work and household productivity (Prasad et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000896">2004</CitationRef>; van Roijen, Essink-Bot, Koopmanschap, Bonsel, &amp; Rutten, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008123">1996</CitationRef>). Each module asks the respondents to provide an estimate of the number of hours that are missed from work (absenteeism), needed to make up for decreased productivity (­presenteeism) and those spent on household activities, within the past 2 weeks. In order to determine the degree of work productivity loss, respondents with illness are compared to either the general population or a control group of non-ill respondents with respect to the hours associated with each of the three modules. The fourth module asks respondents to rate the degree to which their health condition limits their ability to complete work or household activities. The impediment rating is measured on a 3-point scale, where 0  =  No Impediment, 1  =  Some Impediment, and 2  =  A lot of Impediment. The HLQ has been tested for validity and feasibility with a sample of the general population, as well as four different health condition samples, including migraine, spinal cord injury, knee replacement, and hip replacement (Prasad et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000896">2004</CitationRef>; van Roijen et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008123">1996</CitationRef>). Findings suggest that there is a high degree of feasibility, meaning the questionnaire is relatively easy to administer and takes only about 10 min to complete, that there is a high degree of validity for modules 1, 3, and 4 (van Roijen et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008123">1996</CitationRef>). However, the developers of the HLQ have recommended that more research be conducted on module two before utilizing the instrument for assessment of presenteeism (van Roijen et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008123">1996</CitationRef>).</Para>

                  <Heading>Disease-Specific Instruments</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">There are several instruments that have been developed for measuring absenteeism and presenteeism for specific disease conditions. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire</Emphasis> (WPAI) has been modified into four different disease-specific versions, including (1) the WPAI-Special Health Problem survey, (2) the WPAI-Allergic Rhinitis survey, (3) the WPAI-Gastro-Esophageal Reflux ­survey, and (4) the WPAI-Chronic Hand Dermatitis survey (Prasad et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000896">2004</CitationRef>). The WPAI-Special Health Problem survey can be easily modified to address any specific condition by simply replacing generic terms in the survey questions with terms specific to the disease of interest (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, etc.). A number of specific studies have been conducted for each of these WPAI disease-specific surveys, the findings of which have provided statistical support for the validity and reliability of each version in measuring workplace productivity loss associated with allergic rhinitis, GERD and chronic hand dermatitis respectively (Reilly, Lavin, Kahler, &amp; Pariser, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008100">2003</CitationRef>; Reilly, Tanner, &amp; Meltzer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008101">1996</CitationRef>; Wahlquist, Carlsson, Stalhammar, &amp; Wiklund, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008128">2002</CitationRef>). In addition to the disease-specific versions of the WPAI, there are also two questionnaires that have been developed specifically for assessing the impact of migraine headache on productivity, both workplace and household activities. The Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) is a questionnaire with seven questions that assesses the impact of migraine on work, household and daily activities (Prasad et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000896">2004</CitationRef>; Stewart, Lipton, Kolodner, Liberman, &amp; Sawyer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008116">1999</CitationRef>; Stewart et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008117">2000</CitationRef>). The MIDAS survey asks respondents questions about the frequency and severity of headache, the amount of time missed from work/school, household and other activities and the number of days in which productivity was reduced by half or more for work/school and household activities.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Subsequent psychometric studies have found that MIDAS does provide a high degree of validity and reliability, especially in measuring frequency and severity of headache episodes and in establishing the relationship between migraine headache incidence and increased absenteeism and presenteeism (Stewart et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008116">1999</CitationRef>). However, the researchers also found that recall of headache episodes seemed to be much more accurate than recall of work productivity loss episodes. The explanation of this finding is that headache episodes occur more frequently than the amount of work missed, which makes them more memorable. Another possible explanation for the more accurate recall of headache episodes is that they are, by definition, very painful, and therefore may be more memorable due to the experience of increased physical and emotional distress as compared to the relatively mundane experience of day-to-day work routines. Of course, both of these mechanisms, frequency of occurrence and experience of pain, could be present. Whatever the underlying cause of differences in recall, the researchers concluded that more research into recall bias was needed, as well as possible modifications to the questionnaire (Stewart et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008117">2000</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Migraine Work and Productivity Loss Questionnaire</Emphasis> (MWPLQ) is an instrument that asks respondents a series of 29 questions, most of which consist of items about the difficulty of various types of work tasks, but also asks about the number of hours of work missed, the amount of impairment at work, and several questions about migraine therapies and recent attacks (Lerner et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000867">1999</CitationRef>; Prasad et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000896">2004</CitationRef>). There are seven areas, or domains, of work for which questions are asked: (1) time management, (2) quality, (3) quantity, (4) bodily effort, (5) interpersonal demands, (6) mental effort, and (7) environmental factors. The questions are presented on a 6-point Likert scale, ranging from “No Difficulty” to “So Much Difficulty, Couldn’t Do At All.” A follow-up study found significant evidence that the MWPLQ has a high degree of validity and reliability in measuring the impact of migraine on work productivity (Davies, Santanello, Gerth, Lerner, &amp; Block, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000826">1999</CitationRef>). No problems of episode recall, like those found in the MIDAS questionnaire, were reported. However, there was a low correlation between MWPLQ items and the SF-36 Health survey, which is another general health status questionnaire used in the assessment of a variety of health conditions, but not an instrument designed to measure absenteeism and presenteeism.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">A recent measure, the Absenteeism Screening Questionnaire, has been developed to assess and predict long-term absenteeism for patients with low back pain (Truchon et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008122">2012</CitationRef>). This screening device shows strong psychometric capabilities for identifying individuals with acute back pain who may benefit from primary interventions to increase likelihood of return-to-work.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">While many measures are specifically designed to assess absenteeism and presenteeism, other well-established measures that evaluate other aspects of health have also been shown to be good ­indicators of increased sick leave and lost productivity. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a well-validated self-report instrument used to evaluate Axis I psychopathology, including somatization, depression, anxiety, panic, and other clinical disorders (Spitzer et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008115">1999</CitationRef>). A subset of the PHQ that focuses on somatoform disorders (PHQ-15) was recently assessed to determine an association with somatization and increased sick leave (de Vroege, Hoedeman, Nuyen, Sijtsma, &amp; van der Felz-Cornelis, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000827">2012</CitationRef>). This study used a receiving operator characteristic (ROC) analysis to derive a cutoff score of ≥9 points on the PHQ-15 that would indicate higher likelihood of frequent sick leave.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Another example is the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), was originally developed to assess maladaptive behaviors related to pain conditions (Waddell, Newton, Henderson, Somerville, &amp; Main, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008127">2007</CitationRef>). Inrig, Amey, Borthwick, and Beaton (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000850">2012</CitationRef>) recently evaluated using the FABQ to assess work return following leave associated with upper extremity injuries. The findings showed that workers exhibiting higher levels of fear-avoidance were less likely to return to work.</Para>

                <Heading>Cost Models for Assessing the Economic Impact of Productivity Loss</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">From an economic standpoint, it is essential to quantify the impact of these indirect costs associated with poor health, by translating the lost time and productivity into dollar amounts. Several models have been developed that attempt to capture the true costs of worker absenteeism and presenteeism. This section highlights each of the models developed for quantifying indirect costs of illness. First, the Human Capital Approach is a straightforward calculation of production loss that simply multiplies the time lost by the absent or impaired employee’s wage (Johannesson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000853">1996</CitationRef>). One inherent problem identified with using the Human Capital Approach is that the total calculation can be seen as an overestimation if worker replacement is not considered. For individuals with long-term absences, this estimation for lost productivity is seen to be very high using the Human Capital Approach. Another concern about using the Human Capital Approach questions the assumption that an individual’s wage is an appropriate measure of the total value of productivity (Brouwer, van Exel, Koopmanschap, &amp; Rutten, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000815">2002</CitationRef>). In the case where the absent or impaired worker is part of a team, his/her absence can have a cascading effect on the productivity of other team members (Koopmanschap et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000862">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The second model developed to quantify worker absenteeism and presenteeism is the Friction Cost Method (Koopmanschap, Rutten, van Ineveld, &amp; van Roijen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000863">1995</CitationRef>). The premise of the Friction Cost Method is that after an initial adaptation period, termed the “friction period,” the absent worker would be replaced, and the lost hours from an impaired employee could also be overcome by replacement or through working extra hours. From this perspective, the emphasis for the calculation is based on the “value added” by a productive employee/replacement rather than focusing directly on the wages paid. By using the Friction Cost Method, the estimates of productivity loss due to illness are much lower as compared to the Human Capital Approach (Johannesson &amp; Karlsson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000854">1997</CitationRef>). Finally, a third approach for quantifying productivity costs shifts away from assigning dollar amounts to lost time, and redirects focus on the individual’s quality of life. This method was put forth by the US Panel charged with evaluating cost-effectiveness related to health care (Gold, Siegel, Russell, &amp; Weinstein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000841">1996</CitationRef>; Koopmanschap et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000862">2005</CitationRef>). The panel recognizes that the quality of life of individuals who are ill or injured has a direct impact on their finances, specifically through their decrease of income. By using an approach focusing on quality of life as part of the health assessment, this method should, theoretically, include the quantitative productivity losses measured by other approaches. While the theory behind assessing quality of life is acknowledged as being reasonable, there is still a large debate as to whether this method accurately quantifies lost productivity due to illness or injury (Brouwer et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000815">2002</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Both the Human Capital Approach and the Friction Cost Method were specifically developed to assess the costs of productivity loss due to worker absence. While there is much debate over the best mathematical formula for quantifying indirect costs due to worker absences, it is considerably more difficult to assess the costs of productivity losses for presentees. That being said, the Human Capital and Friction Cost methods have both been extended to provide estimates of costs associated with presenteeism in some studies (Lofland et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000874">2004</CitationRef>). However, the calculations for estimating costs of presenteeism are not as straightforward as absenteeism. There are a number of reasons that make assessing the costs of presenteeism difficult. For instance, many individuals remain at work while sick, and presenteeism can often occur prior to and immediately following an absence related to illness (Brouwer et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000815">2002</CitationRef>). Furthermore, the specific type of illness can have a direct effect on the degree of productivity loss while present at work. Many studies have been published regarding specific dollar amounts associated with specific illnesses (see Sect. “Factors Related to Absenteeism and Presenteeism in the Workplace” of this chapter). Because of these difficulties, economists are currently developing new models to help better quantify productivity costs associated with presenteeism.</Para>

              <Heading>Factors Related to Absenteeism and Presenteeism in the Workplace</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Many studies have evaluated factors related to absenteeism and presenteeism in the workplace. Most of these studies have focused on specific illnesses, injuries, health behaviors, and occupational factors that have been shown to increase the rates of absenteeism and presenteeism in various fields of work. This section provides an overview of the current research specific to acute illnesses, chronic illnesses, health behaviors, such as obesity, smoking, and alcoholism, and psychosocial factors, and examines the prevalence of absenteeism and presenteeism along with the estimated direct and indirect costs. Additionally, research specific to how occupational factors, such as stress and burnout, work type, demand, scheduling, and job satisfaction, relate to absenteeism and presenteeism is presented.</Para>

                <Heading>Acute Illness</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Acute illnesses are oftentimes the most thought about as regards to absenteeism and presenteeism. These types of illnesses can include, but are not limited to, allergies, colds, flu, acute low back pain, gastrointestinal distress, etc. In contrast to chronic illnesses, acute illnesses are episodic and are usually remedied within a few days. This section assesses various types of common acute illnesses that have been linked to absenteeism and presenteeism in the workplace.</Para>
                <Section3 ID="Sec000810">
                  <Heading>Allergies</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Allergic reactions occur when the immune system responds abnormally to the presence of a foreign substance. While some reactions are more severe, such as those caused by certain foods or insect bites, most individuals suffer from seasonal allergies resulting from exposure to various types of pollen. The prevalence of individuals in the USA reporting seasonal allergies with symptoms lasting more than 6 days within 1-year duration was estimated at 30 % (Nathan et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000888">2008</CitationRef>). Based on a large-scale survey by Loeppke et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000873">2007</CitationRef>), the most prevalent health condition reported by employees was allergies. In fact, medical and drug costs estimated for treating allergies were found to be ­approximately one-third the accumulated costs associated with increased rates of absenteeism and presenteeism related to allergy symptoms. Another evaluation of the effects of allergies on worker productivity showed that for employees in the manufacturing industry, as allergy symptoms increased to moderate and severe levels, productivity losses also increased (Bunn et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000816">2003</CitationRef>). As part of a wellness screening, Lamb et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000865">2006</CitationRef>) identified that individuals experiencing allergic symptoms worked, on ­average, 2.3 fewer hours per day as compared to employees not experiences allergy symptoms. In an evaluation of the impact of medical conditions on worker productivity for Lockheed Martin employees, allergies or sinus problems were found to be highly prevalent (59.8 % of personnel), and accounted for 4.1 % average productivity loss (Hemp, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000846">2004</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">An examination of the relationship between pollen counts and worker productivity showed that, as pollen counts increased, untreated allergies resulted in greater absenteeism and lower productivity as compared to treated allergies (Burton, Conti, Chen, Schultz, &amp; Edington, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000819">2001</CitationRef>). Sullivan, Navaratnam, Lorber, and Shekar (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0008119">2010</CitationRef>) conducted a study on the cost-effectiveness of a non-sedating H1-antagonist (<Emphasis Type="Italic">desloratadine</Emphasis>) for patients with persistent allergic rhinitis. The findings support that the treatment provided significant cost-savings in relation to work productivity, that is, individuals receiving the medication were shown to exhibit significantly greater worker productivity as compared to those who received a placebo. While it is not plausible for individuals to avoid exposure to environmental allergens, these studies presented support the need for adequate treatment for individuals with allergies in order to reduce the negative effects of increased absenteeism and presenteeism.</Para>

                  <Heading>Influenza</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Influenza, an acute respiratory virus that spreads rapidly, can affect up to 20 % of any given population (CDC, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00082">2008</CitationRef>). The economic burden of an influenza pandemic is considerable. Based on 2003 data, direct costs associated with medical care in the US were estimated over $10 billion annually. Moreover, the costs associated with earnings lost due to illness or death approximated $16 billion annually. It is estimated that the total economic burden of influenza, including medical care and productivity losses, equates to over $87 billion annually (Molinari, Ortega-Sanchez, &amp; Messonnier, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000882">2007</CitationRef>). Of these total societal costs for the influenza pandemic, more than 80 % are attributed to absenteeism or ­presenteeism (Szucs, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008120">1999</CitationRef>). Based on a comprehensive review of the literature on lab-reported, physician-­diagnosed, and self-diagnosed influenza, the average length of absence from work ranged between 3 and 7 days (Keech &amp; Beardsworth, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000856">2008</CitationRef>). A consideration to be made when evaluating the effects on worker productivity in relation to influenza is to distinguish rates of absenteeism based on the individual’s illness from the time missed due to taking care of an ill dependent. Palmer, Rousculp, Johnston, Mahadevia, and Nichol (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000893">2009</CitationRef>) surveyed employees with children to assess the days missed and hours of presenteeism for personal influenza illness, household influenza illness, and a combination of both personal and household influenza illness. Employees with personal influenza illnesses reported more than twice the number of days missed from work as compared to employees without influenza illnesses. Findings also showed that employees missed more days of work caring for household influenza illnesses, relative to the days missed for caring for household acute respiratory illnesses. In fact, 17.7 % of employee absences were attributed to household influenza illness. With respect to presenteeism, employees with acute respiratory illnesses reported being less productive for 1.8 h each day they worked with symptoms; however, employees with influenza-like illness reported being less productive for 4.8 h each day worked with symptoms. Likewise, employees with household influenza illness reported significantly less productive work time as compared to employees with other wintertime respiratory illnesses.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">In a study on influenza-based absenteeism and presenteeism, Ablah et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00087">2008</CitationRef>) surveyed individuals with varying types of occupations regarding whether or not they have left work early or if they have ever remained at work with symptoms of an influenza-like illness. Between 70 and 80 % of workers stated that they have left work because of influenza symptoms. When asked if they have ever continued working with influenza symptoms, roughly 60 % stated they have. This included employees working in health-care (59 %) and school systems (57 %). Interestingly, only 27 % of employees who work in health education reported that they have continued to work while experiencing influenza symptoms. While influenza is highly contractible within families, schools and workplaces, many strategies have been studied to prevent the spread of the virus. By educating individuals about hand washing and covering sneezes, and by offering easy access to vaccinations, employers can proactively help their employees reduce their risk of developing influenza-like illnesses (later in this chapter, a description of interventions aimed at influenza prevention is presented).</Para>

Two common gastrointestinal disorders that have been evaluated extensively are functional dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Functional dyspepsia is characterized by upper-abdominal pain and discomfort for which there is no identifiable cause. In a recent study conducted by Brook et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000813">2010</CitationRef>), use of sick days for employees with functional dyspepsia was significantly greater compared to those without functional dyspepsia; however, there were no significant differences in rates of short-term or long-term disability. Presenteeism for employees with functional dyspepsia was more pronounced. The work productivity for employees with functional dyspepsia was 12 % less than the control group.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition for which gastric acid from the stomach enters the esophagus, resulting in pain (heartburn), regurgitation, and other symptoms such as coughing, asthma, and hoarseness (Brook et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000814">2007</CitationRef>). Although GERD is not generally life threatening, there is an economic burden associated with medical treatments and indirect costs. In a comparison of direct to indirect costs for GERD, the costs associated with absenteeism and presenteeism amounted to more than three times the costs associated with medical care and treatments (Loeppke et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000873">2007</CitationRef>). In a study on presenteeism associated with GERD, Gisbert et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000838">2009</CitationRef>) observed a decrease of 26 % in productivity for employees diagnosed with GERD. In a study at Lockheed Martin, 15 % of the employees were diagnosed with GERD. The analysis showed that average productivity loss associated with GERD was 5.2 % which accounted for $582,660 in aggregate losses (Hemp, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000846">2004</CitationRef>). As with many acute illnesses, appropriate medical assessment and treatment is imperative to reduce negative consequences, such as absenteeism and lost productivity. While gastrointestinal disorders, such as functional dyspepsia and GERD, are very prevalent, these conditions are often preventable and ­manageable with the appropriate medical treatment.</Para>

                  <Heading>Acute Pain Conditions</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Pain conditions affect everyone at some point in their lives. However, individual differences in the intensity and duration of the pain are highly variable. When evaluating the effects of pain conditions on work-related absenteeism and presenteeism, most studies have focused on specific pain sources. This section is focused on how acute or episodic pain conditions such as migraine and premenstrual syndrome affect absenteeism and lost productivity at work.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">
                              <Emphasis Type="Italic">Migraine</Emphasis>. Migraine headache is an episodic condition, but can become persistent for many who suffer from this painful disorder. Although the medical treatment for migraine is relatively inexpensive, the costs associated with absenteeism and lost production are high. Hu, Markson, and Lipton (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000848">1999</CitationRef>) estimated that, of the total costs associated with migraine, approximately 93 % are attributed to indirect costs (both absenteeism and presenteeism). In fact, the majority of the indirect costs due to migraine disorders involve presenteeism (Levin-Epstein, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000869">2005</CitationRef>). The prevalence of migraine disorder is highest between the ages of 22 and 55, which are noted as “peak employment years” (Berry, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00088">2007</CitationRef>), but rates are most pronounced between 30 and 49 years of age (Hazard, Munakata, Bigal, Rupnow, &amp; Lipton, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000843">2009</CitationRef>). Typically, females are more likely to be diagnosed with migraine disorder, which is commonly attributed to hormonal fluctuations (Berry, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00088">2007</CitationRef>; Hazard et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000843">2009</CitationRef>). A general problem for individuals with migraine disorders is that they often attempt to treat their own symptoms with over-the-counter medications and remedies rather than seeking treatment from a medical provider (Berry, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00088">2007</CitationRef>; Linde &amp; Dahlof, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000870">2004</CitationRef>). As part of the American Migraine Study (1998), of the individuals not seeking medical treatment for their migraines, 61 % reported severe to very severe pain, and 67 % reported severe disability (Lipton &amp; Stewart, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000872">1998</CitationRef>). The 2004 AMPP study identified that only 12 % of individuals with migraine disorder were taking prophylactic medication to prevent the occurrence of migraines (Lipton, Bigal, &amp; Diamond, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000871">2007</CitationRef>). From an employer’s perspective, two steps can be made to help employees with migraine disorders. First, employers can identify employees who regularly suffer from migraine headaches and recommend that the employees seek medical treatment rather than self-medicating for persistent migraine. Second, the employers can proactively identify and regulate migraine triggers that can occur in the workplace, such as lighting intensity or unusual smells (perfumes, candles, secondhand smoke, etc.) (Berry, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00088">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>

                              <Emphasis Type="Italic">Premenstrual Disorders</Emphasis>. Current research has shown how women with premenstrual disorders, such as premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, exhibit high rates of absenteeism and lost productivity in the workplace (Heinemann, Minh, Filonenko, &amp; Uhl-Hochgraber, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000845">2010</CitationRef>). In this international study, women reporting as having either mild or no PMS/PMDD symptoms were compared to those with moderate-to-severe symptoms. When evaluating absenteeism, those with moderate-to-severe symptoms were 2.4 times more likely to miss at least 1 day of work per month, compared to those with mild or no PMS/PMDD symptoms. Rates of worker productivity losses were also much higher for the moderate-to-severe PMS/PMDD group, such that 69.4 % of those with moderate-to-severe symptoms, as compared to 23.4 % of those with mild or no symptoms reported moderate reductions in productivity and efficiency.</Para>

                  <Heading>Pulmonary Diseases</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Pulmonary diseases, such as uncontrolled asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are found to have an impact on absenteeism and worker productivity. Based on 2007 data from the American Lung Association, costs associated with asthma approximated $20 billion, which included medical care (physician visits, hospital care, prescriptions), mortality and morbidity (including costs attributed to productivity losses) (ALA, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00081">2009</CitationRef>). Parents of children with asthma are oftentimes absent from work due to dependent care. Yet, only about 8 % of the costs associated with asthma are in relation to absenteeism. In fact, it is estimated that presenteeism for individuals with asthma decreases productivity by more than one-third (Hoppin, Stillman, &amp; Jacobs, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00083">2010</CitationRef>). In a large-scale survey assessing rates of absenteeism and quality of life for both individuals with asthma and those who are caregivers for individuals with asthma, the findings show that uncontrolled asthma has a much greater impact on worker productivity and absenteeism as compared to those with asthma that is better controlled (Dean, Calimim, Kindermann, Khandker, &amp; Tinkelman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000828">2009</CitationRef>). In fact, 43 % of adults with uncontrolled asthma reported missing days from work, relative to only 23 % of adults with controlled asthma. Of those who are caretakers of dependents with asthma, 31 % reported missing work due to care of dependents with uncontrolled asthma, as compared to 16 % of the caretakers of dependents with controlled asthma. This delineation between controlled and uncontrolled asthma is an important one. In order to reduce the negative symptoms and poor impact on worker productivity associated with uncontrolled asthma, appropriate assessment and treatment for asthma conditions is imperative.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">As a leading researcher on pulmonary diseases, Dr. William Bunn provides insight into how chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects workplace productivity (Vogenberg, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008125">2009</CitationRef>). While the prevalence of smoking overall is on the decline, blue-collar workers who smoke represent twice the number of white-collar workers who smoke. Medical costs and costs related to short-term disability (absenteeism) are approximately three times greater for employees with COPD, as compared to the medical and absentee costs for employees without this disease. A key message provided by Dr. Bunn is that because smoking is a major risk factor for the development of COPD, employers who provide cessation programs for their employees can drastically reduce medical and absentee costs in conjunction with the occurrence of this disease.</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">Many individuals suffer from chronic pain conditions that are more organic in nature, as opposed to being the result of an injury. Researchers have studied the socioeconomic burden of chronic pain conditions such as arthritis, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia. Needless to say, individuals with these chronic pain conditions exhibit high levels of absenteeism and reduced productivity in the workplace.</Para>

                              <Emphasis Type="Italic">Arthritis</Emphasis>. Arthritis is a chronic pain condition associated with breakdown or inflammation of the joint, causing swelling, stiffness and limited movements. The leading cause of worker disability is attributed to arthritis (Escorpizo et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000832">2007</CitationRef>). In fact, more than half of all individuals who suffer from arthritis have reported work disability (Dunlop, Manheim, Yelin, Song, &amp; Chang, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000830">2003</CitationRef>), and those with arthritis are less likely to be employed because of their debilitating condition (Jantti, Aho, Kaarela, &amp; Kautiainen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000852">1999</CitationRef>). Loeppke et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000873">2007</CitationRef>) projected the costs for absenteeism and presenteeism for individuals with arthritis to more than triple the costs associated with medical care and treatment of the chronic pain condition. Burton et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000820">2008</CitationRef>) estimated that in a company with 10,000 employees, the costs of rheumatoid-arthritis absenteeism amounted to $1.55 million annually. In the study on employees at Lockheed Martin, the prevalence rate of arthritis was 19.7 %, and the rate of worker productivity loss associated with arthritis was 5.9 % (Hemp, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000846">2004</CitationRef>). As part of a nationwide study, employees with arthritis reported an average of 4.5 h of lost productivity per week due to pain (Stewart, Ricci, Chee, Morganstein, &amp; Lipton, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008118">2003</CitationRef>).</Para>

Osteoarthritis is a chronic pain condition that predominately affects weight-bearing joints, such as the hip and the knee. It is estimated that up to 27 million adults in the USA are affected by osteoarthritis, and over half of all cases are reported in individuals 65 years or older (Kotlarz, Gunnarsson, Fang, &amp; Rizzo, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000864">2010</CitationRef>; Lozada et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00084">2011</CitationRef>). A recent study evaluating the aggregate absenteeism costs attributed to individuals with osteoarthritis reported annual costs to approximate $10.3 billion in the USA (Kotlarz et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000864">2010</CitationRef>). Sadosky, Bushmakin, Cappelleri, and Lionberger (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0008107">2010</CitationRef>) conducted a cost analysis on lost productivity based on the level of severity of osteoarthritis. Costs associated with patients with mild levels of severity of osteoarthritis averaged $6,096 per year, whereas those with moderate levels averaged $13,251 per year. Patients reporting severe levels of osteoarthritis averaged $17,214 per year in productivity losses.</Para>

Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain condition for which the patient experiences widespread muscle pain without any etiological source. Accounting for &lt;5 % of the general population, fibromyalgia is more likely to affect females with increasing age (Wolfe, Ross, Anderson, Russell, &amp; Hebert, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008134">1995</CitationRef>). Annual medical care costs, including office visits to primary care and rheumatology specialists and hospital coverage, is found to be significantly greater for individuals with fibromyalgia ($7,286) compared to those without fibromyalgia ($3,915). Annual costs related to disability and absenteeism are also greater for individuals with fibromyalgia ($2,913) relative to those without fibromyalgia ($1,359) (White et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008133">2008</CitationRef>). Furthermore, White et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0008133">2008</CitationRef>) also evaluated rates of absenteeism for individuals with fibromyalgia and found that, on average, fibromyalgia employees miss almost three times as many workdays due to disability and medically related issues, as compared to employees without fibromyalgia. Kleinman et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000861">2009</CitationRef>) evaluated the levels of lost productivity for individuals with fibromyalgia and, based on both self-report and objective-based criterion, individuals with fibromyalgia exhibited significantly lower rates of worker productivity as compared to those without fibromyalgia.</Para>

It is estimated that between 70 and 80 % of individuals diagnosed with multiple sclerosis are not able to work (Roessler et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008106">2003</CitationRef>). For those who continue to work, research has shown that the cost burdens for employers are primarily due to short and long-term disability and general absenteeism. Ivanova et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000851">2009</CitationRef>) conducted a cost analysis comparing employees with multiple sclerosis to a matched control group. The average annual costs of medical expenses for employees with multiple sclerosis were $15,277, compared to $3,948 for the control group. Indirect costs associated with disability, and medically related absenteeism was reported to be $5,769 annually for employees with multiple sclerosis, whereas expenses for those in the matched control group were $1,417 annually. Naci, Fleurence, Birt, and Duhig (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000887">2010</CitationRef>) conducted a comprehensive literature review on the indirect costs associated with employees with multiple sclerosis.

                  <Heading>Chronic Pain: Musculoskeletal Injuries</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Chronic occupational musculoskeletal disorders are highly prevalent in the working community and, not only can these injuries be debilitating to the individual, but they can also be very costly for the employer and insurance companies. It is estimated that approximately $70 billion are spent annually on health-care utilization and work productivity losses due to patients with chronic pain conditions (Gatchel, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000834">2004</CitationRef>). The majority of workplace injuries related to musculoskeletal disorders can occur either gradually or suddenly, as in the case of an accident. Sprains, strain or tearing of the back ­muscles, overexertion, and falls were the most commonly reported events causing workplace injuries. Upper-extremity injuries of the shoulder and wrist were more likely caused by overexertion or ­repetitive motions, and falls and overexertion were the most reported causes of lower-extremity injuries (Courtney &amp; Webster, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000825">2001</CitationRef>). While overexertion was the source reported for 75.6 % of all musculoskeletal disorders in 2007 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000817">2007</CitationRef>), disorders caused by falls in general were identified to be the most disabling of all musculoskeletal injuries (Courtney &amp; Webster, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000825">2001</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Occupational injuries are routinely reported by incidence rates and by duration of absence from work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2007, the overall rate of nonfatal occupational musculoskeletal injuries requiring time away from work was reported to be 35 per 10,000 full-time employees. The median days of work absence was 9, and 27.9 % of injured employees were absent from work more than 30 days. Based on specific body region affected by the occupational musculoskeletal injury, 48 % were back injuries, 14.5 % were upper-extremity injuries, 1.6 % were cervical injuries, 8.1 % were lower-extremity injuries, and 4.7 % affected multiple body regions. Based on the nature of the injury, 75.3 % of musculoskeletal injuries were reported as sprains or strains, 13.7 % were reported as soreness or pain, and 3.6 % were identified as carpel tunnel syndrome (Bureau of Labor Statistics, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000817">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">The prevalence rates of musculoskeletal injuries are typically reported for specific occupations and industries. For musculoskeletal injuries of the neck, back, and upper-extremity regions, the top five industries cited for the highest percentages of workers’ compensation claims were air transportation, foundation and building contractors, couriers, nursing home facilities, and general freight trucking companies (Bonauto, Silverstein, Adams, &amp; Foley, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000811">2006</CitationRef>). In 2007, nursing aides, attendants, and orderlies reported the highest rate of injury or illness at 465 per 10,000 full-time workers; while transportation and material movers with musculoskeletal injuries accounted for the greatest duration of work absence, with a median of 11 days and 31.7 % absent more than 30 days (Bureau of Labor Statistics, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000817">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Evaluating the costs associated with musculoskeletal disorders, Loeppke et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000873">2007</CitationRef>) estimated that the total costs, both direct and indirect, for back and neck pain equated to the total costs for arthritis and to surpass the total costs of all other chronic pain conditions. Interestingly though, while the direct costs associated with arthritis is about 10 % of the total costs, costs for medical care and treatments for back, neck, and other chronic pain conditions surpass the costs associated with absenteeism and presenteeism. In a study on back pain exacerbations for US workers, Ricci et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0008103">2006</CitationRef>) identified the prevalence of individuals with back pain to be 15.1 %. Within this cohort, 42 % reported back pain exacerbations within the prior 2 weeks. In a cost analysis of employees with back pain, it is estimated that total costs for employers approximates $7.4 billion annually. Moreover, it is estimated that 71.6 % of this total cost is attributed to workers with exacerbated back pain.</Para>

In this study, the various factors considered included lifestyle factors (smoking, physical inactivity, seatbelt use, alcohol use, and use of relaxation medication), perception factors (life dissatisfaction, poor physical health, job dissatisfaction, and high stress), and biological factors (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity). The estimated loss of productivity increased with each additional risk factor. Individuals reporting only one risk factor were identified to exhibit 1.9 % lost productivity.

                  <Para TextBreak="No">A few studies have evaluated the effects of alcohol use and smoking on worker absenteeism and reduction in worker productivity. These studies have found a positive relationship between alcohol use and smoking with increased absences and reduced productivity. For example, in an evaluation on the effects of alcoholism on absenteeism, Roche, Pidd, Berry, and Harrison (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0008105">2008</CitationRef>) examined the rates of employee absences during a 3 month duration. The average percentage of employees who missed work due to alcohol use was 3.5 % overall. This percentage was much higher for the younger age groups (8.8 % for the 14–19-year-old group, and 7.5 % for the 20–29-year-old group). Based on occupation type, 4.1 % of blue-collar workers missed at least 1 day due to alcohol use, compared to 2.9 % of professionals. Further analyses were conducted based on four levels of alcohol consumption: abstinence, low risk, short-term risky, and high-risk levels. Individuals considered to be short-term risky (high number of drinks in a given setting, but a low weekly average) were found to be 12 times more likely to miss work relative to those who abstain from drinking. Individuals in the high-risk group (averaging more than 28 drinks per week for males or 14 drinks per week for females) were found to be 22-times more likely to miss work compared to the abstinence group.</Para>

Stewart et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0008118">2003</CitationRef>) compared rates of presenteeism for smokers, and found that 29.7 % of employees who smoke at lease a pack a day reported more than 2 h of lost productivity time per week, as compared to only 17.4 % of nonsmokers. In a comprehensive multivariate analysis of psychosocial factors associated with the likelihood of sickness absences, women who smoked regularly were 1.4 times more likely to exhibit absenteeism, and men who used alcohol as a sedative were 2.1 times more likely to report sickness absences (Voss, Floderus, &amp; Diderichsen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008126">2004</CitationRef>).</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">The prevalence of obesity in US adult populations is approximately 34 %, and the estimates of ­overweight and obesity combined is 68 % (Flegal, Carroll, Ogden, &amp; Curtin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000833">2010</CitationRef>). Both obesity and overweight individuals are at a higher risk for certain health consequences, such as coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancers, hypertension, dyslipidemia (high cholesterol and high triglycerides), stroke, liver and gallbladder disease, sleep apnea and respiratory problems, osteoarthritis and gynecological problems (NIH, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00086">1998</CitationRef>). Obesity is also related to high rates of absenteeism and presenteeism in the workplace, thus contributing to an increasing amount of direct and indirect health-care costs. Several studies have evaluated the rates of absenteeism and productivity losses in relation to obese employees. Individuals with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 29 had 1.5 % more productivity losses compared to employees in the normal or overweight ranges (Burton et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000818">2005</CitationRef>). Goetzel et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000839">2010</CitationRef>) evaluated the direct and indirect cost burden of overweight and obese workers based on doctors visits, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, absenteeism and presenteeism. The study showed that obese employees had 20 % more doctors’ visits and 26 % more emergency room visits compared to non-obese employees. Furthermore, evaluations of presenteeism showed that overweight employees were 10 % less productive, and obese employees were 12 % less productive, relative to normal weight workers. Gates, Succop, Brehm, Gillespie, and Sommers (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000835">2008</CitationRef>) assessed presenteeism for individuals who were moderately to severely obese (BMI  &gt;  34) and found that these employees showed 4.2 % loss in productivity, as compared to only 1.2 % of all other employees. Indirect costs of absenteeism and presenteeism for obese workers amounted to approximately ten times that of the general medical expenditures (Loeppke et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000873">2007</CitationRef>). In light of these data, many employers have taken an initiative to help their employees lose weight by becoming more physically active. In a study by van Strien and Koenders (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0008124">2010</CitationRef>), physical activity, sports and dietary restrictions were evaluated in relation to absenteeism rates for overweight employees. The findings showed that increased physical activity was a moderator for decreased absenteeism. Dietary restrictions, on the other hand, were found to moderate the effects of obesity on increased absenteeism. Carson, Baumgartner, Matthews, and Tsouloupas (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000822">2010</CitationRef>) examined the effects of both workplace and leisure physical activity in relation to emotional exhaustion, absenteeism and turnover. Poor physical activity was found to mediate the effects of emotional exhaustion on absenteeism and turnover.</Para>

Successful treatment of anxiety disorders typically includes medication, psychotherapy or a combination of both (Hyman &amp; Rudorfer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000849">2000</CitationRef>). Several studies have evaluated the effects of anxiety disorder on health-care expenditures and indirect costs. For example, Caverly, Cunningham, and MacGregor (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000823">2007</CitationRef>) developed a study that classified employees as having either high or low absenteeism and either high or low presenteeism. Within this study, 20.3 % of the employees with both high absenteeism and presenteeism reported anxiety, while 18.6 % of those with low absenteeism and high presenteeism reported anxiety. However, only 8 % of employees with high levels of absenteeism and low levels of presenteeism reported anxiety disorders. This supports the hypothesis that anxiety is more associated with reduced work productivity than being absent from work. In a cost analysis comparing direct to indirect costs associated with anxiety disorder, Loeppke et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000873">2007</CitationRef>) reported that the medical and pharmaceutical costs for treating anxiety were approximately 12 % of the costs associated with absenteeism and presenteeism. Based on a multi-study ­analysis on how psychosocial distress affects absenteeism, the average days of work missed within a 4-week duration due to anxiety disorders ranged from 0.6 to 3.8 days (Hilton, Sheridan, Cleary, &amp; Whiteford, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000847">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">Mood disorders include bipolar disorder, dysthymic disorder and major depressive disorder. The 12-month prevalence of any mood disorder in US adults is 9.5 %, with 45 % of these cases being classified as “severe.” The 12-month prevalence rate for US adults with major depressive disorder is 6.7 % (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, &amp; Walters, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000859">2009</CitationRef>). Of all health-care expenditures in the USA, 6.2 % are allotted for mental health care (Mark et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000877">2005</CitationRef>). Greenberg et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000842">2003</CitationRef>) estimated the total costs for depression to approximate $83 billion, with 62 % of this total applied to absenteeism and reduced productivity. Several studies have also focused on the indirect costs associated with employees with depression disorder and depressive symptoms. In epidemiological-based studies, comparisons were made evaluating absenteeism and presenteeism related to common mental health disorders. For depressive disorders, the estimates based on the prior 30 days showed a range of 0.5–3.1 days missed, and a range of 2.8–8.2 days of reduced productivity (Hilton et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000847">2009</CitationRef>; Sanderson &amp; Andrews, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008109">2006</CitationRef>; Sanderson, Tilse, Nicholson, Oldenburg, &amp; Graves, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008110">2007</CitationRef>). In the Caverly et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000823">2007</CitationRef>) study, comparing employees with high and low levels of absenteeism and presenteeism, the findings showed that 21 % of employees with high presenteeism reported depressive conditions, regardless of the level of absenteeism.</Para>

(<CitationRef CitationID="CR000873">2007</CitationRef>) identified depression as having the highest overall total costs, with the majority related to absenteeism and presenteeism. Indeed, mental health conditions are strongly related to other comorbid health conditions such that psychological distress can develop in conjunction with the presence of a health condition, and likewise depression can exacerbate the physical health disorder. The key to reducing expenditures associated with depression involves both accurate and timely assessment of the condition along with appropriate treatment and compliance (Birnbaum et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00089">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">While both physical health and mental health are strongly correlated with absenteeism and presenteeism in the workplace, occupational factors have also been shown to be very costly to employers. Occupational factors related to job satisfaction and occupational commitment have both been found to be inversely related to absenteeism and presenteeism. This section highlights the research that has been conducted on various occupational factors such as job stress, job characteristics, and job ­satisfaction that are associated with increased absenteeism and reduced worker productivity.</Para>

                  <Heading>Job Stress</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Burnout is a common work factor for employees with consistently high stress levels. Occupational stress can be either physical or psychosocial, and it has been shown to have a strong negative effect on general health, health behaviors, worker productivity and quality of life. Several studies have evaluated the effects of occupational stress as it relates to increased absenteeism and presenteeism in the workplace. In one study comparing employees with either high or low rates of absenteeism and presenteeism, Caverly et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000823">2007</CitationRef>) identified stress to be a more prevalent factor for individuals with high rates of presenteeism, as compared to those with high rates of absenteeism. When the employees in this study were asked about their reasons for presenteeism, the top two responses were: (1) others depend on them (i.e., no back-up or coverage from other employees) and (2) the workload is too high. In a study predicting absenteeism and presenteeism, Gilmour and Patten (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000837">2007</CitationRef>) found that employees with high self-perceived work stress were 1.4 times more likely to exhibit reduced productivity, and were also 1.8 times more likely to be absent from work within a 2-week period. Burton et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000818">2005</CitationRef>) estimated a 4.1 % reduction in productivity due to perceived high stress at work.</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">Other occupational factors associated with the job type, level of job demand, level of job control and shift schedules have been taken into consideration as predictors of increased absenteeism and decreased worker productivity. In a comparison of employees who reported either experiencing presenteeism or not during the prior 2 weeks, it was found that the level of work experience was a significant factor. In fact, employees with greater levels of work experience were less likely to exhibit reduced productivity (Rantanen &amp; Tuominen, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000899">2011</CitationRef>). Type of work was also found to be associated with both absenteeism and presenteeism. Gilmour and Patten (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000837">2007</CitationRef>) found that white-collar workers were 30 % less likely to exhibit presenteeism as compared to sales, service and blue-collar workers. Additionally, sales and service employees were 30 % less likely to be absent from work compared to white-collar and blue-collar employees. Shift work is also related to higher rates of absenteeism. Nurses who work 12-h shifts or evenings, nights or mixed shift types are more likely to be absent from work as compared to nurses on 8-h day shifts (Rajbhandary &amp; Basu, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000898">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">When evaluating the level of demand and the amount of control an employee has in his/her position in relation to presenteeism, more than 40 % of those with low demand and high control reported at least 2 h of reduced productivity in the past week, compared to 23 % of those with high demand and low control positions (Stewart et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008118">2003</CitationRef>). Work factors such as work overload and effort-reward imbalance were also seen to be associated with increased rates of absenteeism (Rajbhandary &amp; Basu, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000898">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>

                  <Para TextBreak="No">Job satisfaction is a self-report item that explains how satisfied or dissatisfied an employee is at his/her current job. Various occupational components can affect this assessment of job satisfaction, such as job security, opportunity for career advancement, organizational trust, supervisor trust, peer support, etc. Job satisfaction is an important variable to consider because it not only is correlated with absenteeism and reduced productivity but also is indicative of turnover. Several studies have evaluated factors related to job satisfaction and their effects on rates of absenteeism and presenteeism. Caverly et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000823">2007</CitationRef>) assessed the correlations between various occupational factors and absenteeism/­presenteeism. While job security and job satisfaction were the variables most correlated with ­absenteeism, stronger correlations were found for presenteeism: job security, career opportunities, trust and supervisor support. Burton et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000818">2005</CitationRef>) reported a 3 % reduction in worker productivity for employees reporting high levels of job dissatisfaction. In a comparison of employees who reported presenteeism behaviors in the prior 4 weeks, Rantanen and Tuominen (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000899">2011</CitationRef>) showed a significant difference in levels of job satisfaction between those with and without reduced productivity. Those not reporting presenteeism showed approximately 20 % higher rates of job satisfaction as compared to those who were considered as presentees.</Para>

              <Heading>Current Intervention Strategies to Prevent or Reduce the Effects of Absenteeism and Presenteeism in the Workplace</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Intervention and prevention programs, such as corporate wellness, smoking cessation and healthy lifestyle programs, offer many benefits to employers, including improved morale, less stress, and greater focus among employees, lower insurance premiums, reduced employee absenteeism and increased productivity (Mulligan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000884">2010</CitationRef>). For the employees themselves, these interventions aim to make them happier and healthier. Due to escalating health-care costs and profits lost to absenteeism and presenteeism, employers have begun to use intervention strategies to address and improve employee health. The Association for Worksite Health Promotion (Mercer, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00085">1999</CitationRef>) reported the same findings, citing improved employee health, increased morale, and the lessening of health-care costs as the impetus for employers to provide disease-prevention and health promotion programs. When employees are emotionally and physically able to work, and also have the desire to work, employers witness less absenteeism and presenteeism (O’Donnell, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000891">2000</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">As the earlier literature review demonstrated, there are several significant issues with illness related presenteeism, including decreased productivity, increased health-care costs, and increased risk of the spread of communicable diseases. In a recent review article, Samuel and Wilson (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0008108">2007</CitationRef>) suggest that all companies should evaluate their rates of presenteeism, especially “customer-facing” businesses because customers do not want to be assisted by ill employees. Likewise, allowing healthy employees to be exposed to their sick coworkers increases the risk that they too will become sick, which only exacerbates the problems lost productivity and costs. In the same article the authors outline the ­problem of presenteeism as well as several employer and legislative solutions.</Para>

                  <Heading>Stay at Home</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Perhaps one of the most basic illness prevention strategies available to employers is simply allowing sick employees to stay at home while ill. One barrier to stay at home is a lack of recognition of the problems associated with illness related presenteeism. As Samuel and Wilson (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0008108">2007</CitationRef>) point out, managers need to be educated about the issue of presenteeism so that they will encourage sick employees to stay home. In addition to educating managers, ensuring that employees are informed about the importance of their health and reminding them that it benefits, not only themselves but their company and coworkers as well. Another barrier to the stay at home solution is that not all employers offer paid sick time. However, given the high costs of presenteeism associated with lost productivity and the risk of the spread of disease, those employers who do not offer paid sick leave may wish to reconsider their policies. Employers who recognize the problems with presenteeism and seek to encourage employees to stay at home when ill will find it much easier to convince them if they offer paid sick leave. The combined approach of education and paid sick leave will most likely serve the company’s long-term financial interests.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Samuel and Wilson (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0008108">2007</CitationRef>) also discuss government policies on providing paid sick leave, which addresses some of the problems with presenteeism. In some states, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) has been passed, which is a leave statute that ensures employers will allow time off for covered employees, even if the time is unpaid. Several states have Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) programs to provide employees with paid short- and long-term leave for injuries and/or illnesses that are not work-related. In February 2007, San Francisco passed a groundbreaking Sick Leave Ordinance that entitled all employees of the county to paid, accrued, hourly sick leave. This time off work can be used for illness, injury, diagnosis, treatment, medical care, and to care for family members. Although there is a 30-h cap on accrued sick leave, employees can keep their unused leave from year-to-year. Other cities and states such as Madison, WI, and the states of Washington, Massachusetts, and Vermont have proposed similar bills for mandated sick leave. At the time of publication none of these measures have passed; however, citizen and government support for these new laws are growing.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">One of the most common methods of prophylaxis used in the prevention of disease is vaccination. In the USA, vaccinations are routinely given to prevent a wide range of childhood diseases, such as polio, rubella, measles, mumps, diphtheria, tetanus, and chicken pox. In adulthood, vaccination efforts are typically focused on influenza, due to the enormous health and economic consequences discussed earlier in this chapter. In response to the threat of influenza pandemic, many private and public health clinics, government and public health departments, as well as many private employers now offer access to inexpensive influenza vaccinations. Although many employers have on-site influenza vaccinations, the majority of employees do not take advantage of this convenience. Nowalk et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000889">2010</CitationRef>) aimed to increase employee vaccination rates by offering two options: an intranasal (LAIV) vaccine and an injectable (TIV) influenza vaccine. They also offered an incentive to employees and increased awareness of the vaccination clinic. Fifty-three companies with vaccine clinics, totaling 1,222 participants, were included in this study. Most of these companies served as controls, while “Choice” sites were given both the LAIV and TIV vaccines and advertised only the choice between vaccines. “Choice Plus” sites also offered both types of vaccinations, but increased advertising as well as highlighted the choice of vaccines, and offered a monetary incentive to employees. The LAIV vaccination was 6.5 % higher in Choice sites and 9.9 % higher for Choice Plus sites. The TIV vaccination resulted in a 15.9 % higher participation from employees aged 50 or older in the Choice Plus sites, but no increase in TIV vaccination was found in either the Choice or Choice Plus sites for employees ages 18–49.</Para>

Many studies have been published that evaluate individual corporate wellness programs, reporting the overall effectiveness of managing diseases and risk factors in terms of absenteeism and presenteeism. The University of Minnesota’s wellness program includes both lifestyle management (LM) and disease management (DM). The DM program included employees with diabetes, asthma, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, arthritis, depression, osteoporosis, musculoskeletal diseases, low-back pain, migraines, gastrointestinal disorder, as well as other health issues. The LM program included employees with obesity, tobacco and alcohol use, hypoglycemia, chronic pain, osteoporosis, pregnancy, and other conditions. Significant results were found in reducing absenteeism by approximately 4 h per employee per year in the DM program, but the LM program was shown to not be ­effective in the reduction of absenteeism. The only factor of the LM program that affected significant reduction in absenteeism was the fatigue program.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Pelletier, Boles, and Lynch (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000895">2004</CitationRef>) conducted a study on 500 employees who participated in a health promotion program at a large national company. All participants belonged to the corporate-sponsored fitness centers, and had access to a multitude of wellness programs and services through the employee benefits department. These employees completed the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health Risk Assessment</Emphasis> (HRA) pre- and post-study, answering 20 questions regarding smoking, exercise, diet, chronic conditions, health status, demographics, and biometric measures. Risk scores were calculated for coronary heart disease, based on 11 risk factors: poor diet, unhealthy body mass index (BMI), high cholesterol, physical inactivity, stress, lack of preventive health-care visits, lack of emotional fulfillment, high blood pressure, tobacco use, diabetes, and alcohol use. Participants also completed the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire</Emphasis> (General Health) (WPAI-GH) to measure the amount of work missed (absenteeism), work impairment (presenteeism), and impaired activity all due to health issues. At the time of the first surveys, employees with an unhealthy body-mass index (BMI), lack of physical activity, lack of emotional fulfillment, diabetes, and high blood pressure had a significantly greater amount of absenteeism and presenteeism. Results of the wellness program showed a significant risk reduction in employees who improved their diet, cholesterol, stress, and engaged in preventative health-care visits. Forty-nine percent of participants reduced their number of health risks, with 19 % reducing two or more, and 30 % reducing one risk factor. Employees who improved their diet and emotional fulfillment had significant improvements in presenteeism; however, no specific health factor was found to reduce absenteeism.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Wendt, Tsai, Bhojani, and Cameron (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0008132">2010</CitationRef>) evaluated the effect of Shell’s Disability Management Program on absenteeism over the course of 5 years. From 1996 to 2002, absenteeism rates among Shell employees increased by 54 %, leading to the development of an in-house disability management program. In 2002, 13,000 employees were managed by two full-time case managers, and site nurses and administrative staff devoted 20 % of their time toward the program. In 2008, 17,500 employees were supported by four full-time case managers, three administrative staff, and 5–10 % of work time from a physician-manager and multiple site nurses. Shell’s Disability Management Program also began to include “transitional duty,” benefits staff, and human resources. Transitional duty allowed employees to return to work in a part-time or restricted capacity, which enabled them to come back to work sooner than if they had waited for fully recovery from illness or injury. After an employee had missed work for four consecutive days, a letter from a doctor was required, and a case manager was assigned to the employee. The case manager coordinated communication between the employer, health-care provider, human resources, benefits, etc. in order to ensure the employee received proper treatment and accommodations. Then, the appropriateness of transitional duty was assessed and, when the employee was ready to return to work, an evaluation of fitness was performed. Results revealed that, overall, hourly employee absences per year decreased by 31 %, while staff absences increased by 3.4 %. Similarly, the researchers found a 30 % decrease in illness days per year among hourly workers, but there was no statistically significant change in illness days among staff employees. However, this trend was not consistent through the course of the study. From 2002 to 2004, there was an overall decrease in absenteeism equating to 1.2 days per year per employee (a decrease from 5.4 to 4.2 days). From 2004 to 2006, there was an increase in absences of 0.8 days per year (an increase to 5.0 days), and this number reversed itself during the 2006–2008 time frame, bringing absenteeism back to the 2004 average rate of 4.2 days per employee per year, which was solely due to decreased absenteeism in hourly workers. Decreases in absenteeism for specific conditions were also reported. Days lost due to circulatory system disorders decreased by 34 % from 2002 to 2008. Absences in the digestive system diagnostic category decreased by 46 %, the genitourinary system by 47 %, injuries by 34 %, the musculoskeletal system by 23 %, pregnancy by 37 %, and absences due to respiratory system issues decreased by 42 %. Shell saved a total of 34,731 days over this 5-year period and had an estimated total savings of $9,740,000, which equates to a 2.4:1 return on investment.</Para>

                  <Heading>Depression</Heading>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Major Depressive Disorder is a debilitating chronic condition that affects 15.7 % of employees during their lifetime, and 8.6 % of employees in a 12-month period (Marcotte, Wilcox-Gok, &amp; Redmon, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000876">1999</CitationRef>; McIntyre, Liauw, &amp; Taylor, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000880">2011</CitationRef>). It is projected that depression will be the second leading cause of disability by the year 2020 (Murray &amp; Lopez, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000886">1997</CitationRef>; Wells et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008131">1989</CitationRef>). Depression and related stress conditions cause the most workforce impairment (Birnbaum et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR00089">2010</CitationRef>), and the lack of effective response to depression accounts for a disproportionate amount of work lost due to presenteeism and absenteeism (Wang et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008130">2007</CitationRef>). McIntyre et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000880">2011</CitationRef>) reported that chronic medical conditions associated with depression, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, pain disorders, dementing disorders, and other chronic stress-sensitive disorders, interact with depression to cause workforce dysfunction. In a comprehensive review on the effects of depression in the workplace, McIntyre et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000880">2011</CitationRef>) reported the efficacy of many different intervention strategies. Stress management programs in the workforce that emphasized adequate sleep, exercise, muscle relaxation, the importance of interpersonal relationships, and the challenging of anxiety provoking and depressogenic thoughts have shown to be effective in reducing employees’ depressive symptoms (Mino, Babzono, Tsuda, &amp; Yasuda, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000881">2006</CitationRef>). Wang et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0008130">2007</CitationRef>) conducted a research study on approximately 150,000 employees of several large national companies. They evaluated the effects of depression screening, outreach, and care management of depressed workers through a telephone program. The need for treatment was assessed, appropriate individuals were referred to in-person treatment, and the researchers encouraged and monitored treatment adherence and provided therapeutic interventions by telephone. Depression was measured with the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptoms Self-Report</Emphasis> (QIDS-SR), and the <Emphasis Type="Italic">WHO Health and Productivity Questionnaire</Emphasis> (HPQ) was used to assess work performance. Employees were randomly assigned to the usual care group or the telephone intervention group, and completed these assessments at baseline, 6 and 12 months. QIDS-SR scores at 6 and 12 months were significantly lower for the intervention group than the usual care group, and there was also significantly higher job retention, as well as more hours worked among employees in the intervention cohort.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">A Canadian study found that workers who were compliant with antidepressant medication were significantly more likely to return to work instead of claiming long-term disability or leaving their employment (Dewa, Hoch, Lin, Paterson, &amp; Goering, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000829">2003</CitationRef>). The researchers also found a 3-week reduction in the length of disability among depressed employees who had early interventions. Laxman, Lovibond, and Hassan (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000866">2008</CitationRef>) suggest that workplace interventions need to de-stigmatize mental illness and to improve access to services through employment assistance programs in order to adequately treat mood disorders in employees. The researchers emphasize the need for these programs to have open communication between the employee, employer, and the health-care provider.</Para>

Ninety-three companies indicated they provided wellness programs to their employees, and the most prevalent type of intervention was smoking cessation. The 2004 study also showed that these smoking cessation programs benefited employers most in terms of lowered health-care costs. To examine this issue more carefully, Mulligan (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000884">2010</CitationRef>) sent abbreviated surveys to these same 524 companies, only asking for information concerning smoking cessation programs. One-hundred seven out of 115 employer respondents indicated the ­presence of a smoking cessation program. Survey results showed that 85 % of companies provided nicotine replacement therapies, and 52 % provided coverage for Zyban, an antidepressant shown to assist cessation (Mulligan, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000884">2010</CitationRef>). Telephone counseling was a part of 42 % of the programs, 32 % had group behavioral activities, 10 % offered financial incentives, and 8 % charged smokers more for health insurance compared to their nonsmoking counterparts.

The researchers estimated the cost of problem drinking among employees for a theoretical Wisconsin company without a treatment program, and also developed a model to estimate the cost of implementing a program that included screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT). They concluded that SBIRT was cost-beneficial to employers, and when absenteeism and presenteeism were included in the analysis, the theoretical firm would save $771 per employee by using this treatment program.</Para>

The participants in the intervention group chose between increasing their physical activity, increasing their dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, or decreasing their consumption of added sugars, as well as saturated fats and trans fats. The Alive! model elicited and maintained healthy behaviors by assessing the individual and providing feedback, goals, tips, and reminders, as well as weekly goal-setting and the promotion of social support. Participants’ health-related quality of life, presenteeism, self-efficacy, and stage of change were assessed at the beginning and end of the program by the SF-8 Health Survey Short Form (Block et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000810">2008</CitationRef>). Presenteeism was measured by self-assessed “reduction in difficulty accomplishing work tasks because of physical and emotional problems,” and participants in the intervention group were 1.47 times more likely to report a reduction than the control group. This study also found a statistically significant improvement in mental health, health status, self-efficacy for changing one’s diet, and stage of change for physical activity and the consumptions of more produce and less fats.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">In a study of overweight and obese employees, Oberlinner et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000892">2007</CitationRef>) reported that, due to the prevalence of overweight and obesity and their associated medical issues, The Commission of the European Community supports health promotion and disease prevention in the workplace. In Germany, the BASF Chemical Company began a health promotion campaign called “Trim Down the Pounds—Losing Weight Without Losing Your Mind.” Out of 34,000 employees at the BASF site in Ludwigshafen, 1,313 participants entered this program, agreeing to lose at least 2 body-mass index (BMI) points, or to reduce their weight to a BMI of &lt;25 over the course of 9 months. Physicians who assessed any obesity-related diseases monitored all participants, and normal-weight coworkers acted as weight-loss helpers. At the conclusion of the study, 658 participants had lost weight, 440 of which had lost more than 2 BMI points. Medical benefits were found, including the reduction of obesity-related diseases. The researchers suggest it is possible to prevent overweight and obesity by encouraging healthy eating habits and physical exercise in the workplace. This benefits both the employee in terms of health, and benefits the employer in terms of cost in improved employee productivity.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Jenny Craig has partnered with corporations to promote workplace weight-loss through diet and exercise (Martin, Talamini, Johnson, Hymel, &amp; Khavjou, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000879">2010</CitationRef>). They have established a Rewards Program that focuses on personalized treatment, goal setting, motivational interviewing, and ­providing discounts based on length of participation. Out of 81,505 members of Jenny Craig’s Rewards Program who enrolled in 2005, 2,418 enrolled through their employer. Retention was significantly higher in Rewards Corporate members at 25.9 weeks than Rewards Noncorporate members, who averaged 21.9 weeks of participation. Due to longer retention periods, the average percentage of weight loss was also higher among Rewards Corporate members at 7.16 %, while Rewards Noncorporate participants showed a mean of 6.20 % of body weight lost. A major strength of this study is that it illustrates how the findings of clinical trials translate to “real world” experiences.</Para>

                <Heading>Occupational Injury Prevention</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">It is widely accepted that occupational musculoskeletal injuries are caused by a multitude of factors, including physical biomechanics and the stresses placed upon specific body regions, ergonomics and workplace structure, and psychosocial and cognitive components. Numerous interventions have been put into place in occupational settings that are aimed at reducing occupational musculoskeletal injuries and limiting the duration of disability following an injury. The most successful interventions have been tailored to specific occupational settings, rather than “blanketed” to all areas involving a certain type of injury (i.e., low back, upper-extremity, etc.). Interventions geared at reducing occupational musculoskeletal injuries can incorporate a global initiative or many specific components depending on the needs of the individuals within the organization. In a systematic review of interventions designed to prevent upper-extremity and neck injuries in the workplace, some of the workstation interventions that were found to be successful included having appropriate lighting, enhanced keyboards, a specialized computer mouse designed to eliminate neuropathic wrist pain, and workstation adjustment based on the ergonomic needs of the individual, such as adjustable chairs and tools that lessen vibration (Boocock et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000812">2007</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Other intervention strategies aimed at preventing neck and upper-extremity injuries include ­various forms of exercise. For example, Waling, Javholm, and Sundelin (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0008129">2002</CitationRef>) found that administrative workers assigned to one of four training programs (strength training, endurance, coordination, or stress reduction) all reported a significant decrease in the intensity and frequency of upper-extremity pain. Ludewig and Borstad (<CitationRef CitationID="CR000875">2003</CitationRef>) developed an intervention to reduce shoulder pain in construction workers with shoulder impingement syndrome. Through a stretching and strength training program that participants were asked to complete at home, self-reported reductions in shoulder pain and increased satisfaction in shoulder function were obtained. In a study comparing short and long bouts of exercise within a fibromyalgia population, Schachter, Busch, and Peloso (<CitationRef CitationID="CR0008111">2003</CitationRef>) found positive effects for both duration types for reduction of the severity of the disease and in improved self-efficacy. Furthermore, the group with extended exercise durations also showed improvements in physical function and psychological distress. Several interventions involving exercise for reducing the incidence of occupational musculoskeletal injuries have been evaluated and shown to have positive effects on the reduction of injuries and an increase in function (Boocock et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000812">2007</CitationRef>). Furthermore, many interventions have been implemented specifically to lessen the risk of low back injury in occupations involving lifting (Hefti et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000844">2003</CitationRef>; Kim, Hayden, &amp; Mior, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000860">2004</CitationRef>; Schenk, Doran, &amp; Stachura, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008112">1996</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Another key factor for prevention and intervention of occupational musculoskeletal injuries is involving the employees in the decision-making processes. Education is an essential component in prevention and intervention programs, such that employees will learn not only how poor ergonomic workplace environments contribute to musculoskeletal distress but also how other factors, such as sedentary work style, repetitive movements, and psychosocial stress play a part in the occurrence of workplace injuries (Carrivick, Lee, &amp; Yau, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000821">2002</CitationRef>; Kashima, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000855">2003</CitationRef>; Pehkonen et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR000894">2009</CitationRef>; Robertson et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008104">2009</CitationRef>). Identifying potential risks is also essential in preventing occupational musculoskeletal injuries. However, ­appropriate steps must be taken in order to reduce such risks. Depending on the demand of the given occupation, appropriate ergonomic principles must be established and followed to ensure employee safety. Many methods of intervention have been identified regarding reduction of injury, but the main concepts that should be considered are the following: identifying areas of risk; educating the employees and supervisors of those risk factors; and creating a work environment that is conducive to eliminating such risks. Encouraging physical activity for sedentary workers and customizing workstations to accommodate the needs of individual employees are proactive measures that contribute to the prevention of injury. Including employees as active members of the intervention team, and allowing their input in decision-making processes aimed at prevention of injuries, has been shown to be directly related to increased safety precautions. Occupational musculoskeletal injury prevention affects both the employee and the employer. By proactively keeping the employees safe, employer costs for medical care, productivity loss, and absenteeism can be substantially reduced (Gatty, Turner, Buitendorp, &amp; Batman, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000836">2003</CitationRef>; Martin, Irvine, Fluharty, &amp; Gatty, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000878">2003</CitationRef>; Morgan &amp; Chow, <CitationRef CitationID="CR000883">2007</CitationRef>; Tompa, Dolinschi, de Oliveira, &amp; Irvin, <CitationRef CitationID="CR0008121">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">It is general knowledge that costs associated with illnesses, injuries and health behaviors are very high, especially considering the costs of health-care premiums, doctor visits, treatments, and medications. These costs are commonly referred to as direct costs. Moreover, there are hidden, indirect costs that far surpass the direct health-care costs of illnesses and injuries. These indirect costs are tied to lost production due to absenteeism and presenteeism, and have been shown to be a dire economic problem in the workplace. As a result, many researchers and economists have attempted to identify the sources and evaluate the effects of absenteeism and presenteeism in the workplace. As we have reviewed, there are many tools that have been developed to assess the frequency and duration of absenteeism and presenteeism in multiple workplace settings, as related to lost production. Furthermore, several models have been created to quantify the total cost attributed to lost productivity. Yet, to date, there is no direct measure that accurately accounts for all production losses associated with illness and injuries for workers.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Most of the research available on the effects of absenteeism and presenteeism has focused on specific diseases, injuries, and health behaviors. As also reviewed in this chapter, there are considerable data available on the costs and effects of absenteeism and presenteeism specific to each type of illness, injury, or health behavior, in addition to occupational factors. Through this comprehensive review of the effects of absenteeism and presenteeism specific to each illness, injury, and health behavior, we have shown how the indirect costs associated with production losses are significantly greater than direct health-care costs. Understanding how absenteeism and presenteeism affect production loss, many employers have taken proactive approaches to helping their employees stay healthy. We have outlined several precautionary measures that employers have utilized to reduce the incidence of illness, injury, and poor health behaviors by offering a venue of interventional regimes to their employees. By adopting this model of prevention, employers will find that rates of absenteeism and presenteeism related to illness, injury and health behaviors can decrease dramatically, thereby reducing the degree of indirect costs associated with production losses.</Para>
