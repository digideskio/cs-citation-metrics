                </ExternalRef>) has been delivering daily air quality forecasts of atmospheric pollutants (O<Subscript>3</Subscript>, NO<Subscript>2</Subscript>, PM<Subscript>10</Subscript>, PM<Subscript>2.5</Subscript>) over Europe and France. Those products are based on chemistry-transport modeling and in particular on the outputs from CHIMERE model. Analysed air quality maps of the previous day are also produced by mixing observed and simulated data through a geostatistical approach.</Para>
              <Para>More recently a methodology has been developed to improve the accuracy of CHIMERE forecasts. It consists of two main stages.</Para>
              <Para>In a preliminary stage, statistical short-term forecasting models are built and validated for each French and European rural or (sub)urban background monitoring site. The response variables are the O<Subscript>3</Subscript> daily maximum, NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> daily maximum and PM<Subscript>10</Subscript> daily average concentrations of the current and the next 2 days. This part is based on the developments carried out and tested within CITEAIRII project (<ExternalRef>

                </ExternalRef>).</Para>
              <Para>In the operational stage, the statistical models identified as reliable enough are applied with a daily frequency to predict concentrations at the corresponding monitoring sites. Locally forecast concentrations are then combined with CHIMERE forecast concentration fields according to the same geostatistical approach as aforementioned. This has been tested so far for O<Subscript>3</Subscript> and PM<Subscript>10</Subscript>. Validation against independent data shows a significant improvement of the forecasts compared with raw CHIMERE outputs.</Para>

Analysed maps are also produced by combining simulations from the chemistry-transport model (CTM) CHIMERE with surface measurements. A geostatistical kriging based procedure is applied [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00352">2</CitationRef>]. The resulting maps are considered as the best possible representation of the pollution situation having occurred.</Para>
              <Para>Using this kriging procedure, the forecast maps can be improved as well by mixing CHIMERE predictions with forecast concentrations at individual stations. The first section deals with the local forecasts and describes how past modelling and measurement data can contribute to construct a better prediction at individual stations. The second section is at this stage a discussion on how those local forecasts can be introduced in the operational mapping.</Para>

              <Para>The statistical methodology, which is referred to as “statistical adaptation” of the regional CTMforecast, was investigated within the framework of CITEAIRII project and presented during ITM31 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00353">3</CitationRef>]. It is aimed at being achievable with limited availability of environmental data. Concentrations of each pollutant at each monitoring station are written as linear function of interpolated CTM outputs, past measurements and other relevant quantitative (meteorology) or qualitative (type of day) predictors. Despite its limitations in capturing non-linear processes, the multiple linear regression technique was selected because of its efficiency, its flexibility, which makes it easy to add or remove predictors, and its low computational cost. Thorough validation studies against observation data from many cities [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00355">4</CitationRef>] highlighted the overall robustness of the method and its ability to significantly improve raw CHIMERE forecasts on local scale.</Para>
              <Para>Statistical short-term forecasting models were built for O<Subscript>3</Subscript> and PM<Subscript>10</Subscript> for all background monitoring sites in Europe (forecasting horizons: D+0, D+1, D+2). Air Base data (<ExternalRef>

Usual validation scores were computed both for CHIMERE raw outputs and for the statistically adapted forecasts; for most stations they are improved by statistical adaptation (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00351">35.1</InternalRef>). From those results numerical bounds can be set for those scores, outside which a statistical model may be considered as less reliable and potentially unsuitable for operational use. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00351">

In the meanwhile, all background stations for which data are available are taken into account (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00352">35.2</InternalRef>). The graph on the right represents CHIMERE raw forecast of the daily mean PM<Subscript>10</Subscript> concentration for a specific day over Europe (D+0 forecast). Within the domain covered by monitoring data, the use of the local forecasts succeeds in reducing the well-known underestimation of PM<Subscript>10</Subscript> concentrations by CTMs. Such map has to be compared to the D-1 analysed map, which is the best estimate obtained a posteriori using observations from all French and European background stations. Good agreement between both figures is observed. Note that in regions or countries with sparse network or no available measurement data, the forecast map is more uncertain. In extrapolation areas, kriging results should be considered with caution. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00352">

              <Para>Much effort has been devoted to improving the quality of the forecasts delivered by the national PREV’AIR system. Parallel to ongoing physical and numerical developments in the CTM, a statistical and geostatistical methodology has been worked out. It consists in combining the results from local statistical forecasting models with CHIMERE outputs on the French and European scales. Several issues are being investigated through validation tests: (1) selection of stations according to their class and location, data variability and the reliability of the statistically adapted models; (2) Evaluation of forecast performance as a function of the prediction horizon: D+0, D+1 or D+2; (3) extension to NO<Subscript>2</Subscript> forecast maps.</Para>

                <Emphasis Type="Bold">Q</Emphasis>: CHIMERE air quality concentrations have been used just as exogeneous variables in the statistical model to make air quality forecasts and then kriging has been applied to extend it for full domain. What if we remove “CHIMERE values” from the statistical model and then try to make forecasts with mapping? I guess, it can still give reasonable results. Has such comparison been made?</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>
                <Emphasis Type="Bold">A</Emphasis>: CHIMERE results are actually used:</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>  – at the monitoring stations, as possible predictor in the statistical models;</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>  – over the whole domain, as drift in the kriging.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>In the statistical modelling, a set of predictors is automatically selected from a list of potential explanatory variables. It may occur that after selection CHIMERE is removed from that set. However this is usually not the case; comparison tests indicated that in general, CHIMERE significantly increased the explanatory power of the statistical models.</SimplePara>
              <SimplePara>In the kriging, CHIMERE proved very useful as well, enabling a better estimation of the concentration spatial variability and the production of more realistic air pollution maps.</SimplePara>
