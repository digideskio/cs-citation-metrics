                <Para ID="Par3">Five key themes accounted for the majority of communication failures in station 2, “history taking” and station 4, “communication skills and ethics” of the MRCP(UK) PACES examination. Two themes, the ability to detect clues and the ability to address concerns, related directly to the overall construct <Emphasis Type="Italic">managing patients’ concerns</Emphasis>. Three other themes were found to impact the whole consultation. These were building relationships, providing structure and explanation and planning.</Para>

                <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par4">Hofstede’s cultural dimensions may help to contextualise some of these observations. In some cultures doctor and patient roles are relatively inflexible: the doctor may convey less information to the patient (higher power distance societies) and give less attention to building rapport (high uncertainty avoidance societies.) This may explain why cues and concerns presented by patients were overlooked in this setting. Understanding cultural differences through Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory can inform the preparation of candidates for high stakes bedside clinical skills examinations and for professional practice.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par5">International Medical Graduates (IMGs) are known to perform less well in many postgraduate medical examinations when compared to their UK trained counterparts [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. This “differential attainment” is observed in both machine-marked knowledge based and bedside clinical skills assessments but has been of particular concern in the UK based Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par6">The Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (UK) (MRCP(UK)) Practical Examination of Clinical Examination Skills (PACES) examination is the largest high stakes postgraduate clinical skills examination in the world with 5000 candidates examined each year. In this examination, which is conducted in the English language only, UK trained medical graduates (UKMGs) had a mean pass rate of 63.4 % between 2009 and 2013 while that of IMGs was 31.4 % [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par7">PACES has a highly structured competency based assessment structure in which seven specific clinical competencies or “skills” are individually assessed [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. IMGs score less well than UKMGs in all seven skills assessed but the difference in performance is greatest for skills that involve communication. One specific communication skill assessed in PACES is the ability of the candidate to “<Emphasis Type="Italic">manage patients’ concerns”</Emphasis>. This is described as <Emphasis Type="Italic">“seeks detects, acknowledges and attempts to address a patient’s or relative’s concerns. Listens. Confirms patient’s or relative’s knowledge and understanding. Empathic.”</Emphasis> This aspect of communication arguably has its origins within a Western approach to the doctor-patient relationship under the umbrella term “patient-centred care” and may be a less prominent feature of medical communication in other cultures.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par8">Other research has identified communication differences between doctors from different cultural backgrounds that may impact on the patient-centred approach. A tendency to be paternalistic towards patients, family involvement in patient care [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>] and concerns about encroaching on gender or social boundaries may make it difficult for some IMGs to offer emotional support to patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. Finally, different cultural perceptions of disease concepts such as depression in later-life and different cultural approaches to teaching and learning have also been identified [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. McCullagh identified further challenges in communication for IMGs, such as understanding “patient speak” (colloquial language), developing awareness of politeness and respect, non-verbal communication, impact of culture and reflective practice [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para ID="Par9">A number of healthcare studies have utilised Hofstede’s cultural dimensions framework to look at the impact of culture on medical practice [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>]. Hofstede [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>] defines culture as “the collective programming of the mind which distinguishes the members of one group from another”. The Hofstede framework categorises aspects of cultural behaviour across countries so that they can be measured and compared. The Hofstede framework has been applied in studies of cross-national differences in antibiotic use [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>], blood donation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>], medical communication between general practitioners and patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>] and the meaning of medical professionalism [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>]. Morrow and colleagues [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>] have used Hofstede’s framework to help understand adaptations that overseas trained doctors have to make when coming to work in the UK.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par10">The framework originally consisted of four dimensions: power distance (PDI), uncertainty avoidance (UA), individualism/collectivism (IDV) and masculinity/femininity (MAS) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>].

                          <SimplePara>Reflects the extent to which members of a society attempt to cope with anxiety by minimising uncertainty. Uncertainty avoiding cultures feel threatened by unknown or unstructured situations. They try to prevent such situations from arising by having strict laws, rules and behaviour codes. In medicine it has been shown that strong uncertainty avoiding societies place less emphasis on building rapport with patients.<Superscript>23</Superscript>

A culture is deemed ‘Individualist’ if the members of the group are supposed to care for themselves and their immediate family only; the ties between individuals are loose. ‘Collectivist’ culture refers to societies in which people from birth onwards are integrated into strong, cohesive in-groups, which throughout a person’s lifetime continue to protect them in exchange for unquestioning loyalty.</SimplePara>

In masculine cultures the differences between gender roles are more dramatic such that men should be seen as assertive and ambitious, whilst women may not have these qualities. In feminine cultures greater emphasis is placed by both men and women on relationships and quality of life.

                <Para ID="Par13">A single MRCP (UK) PACES examination site accustomed to video recording for quality assurance purposes was chosen for the study. The PACES examination consists of a carousel of eight doctor - patient encounters, all of which are directly observed by pairs of clinician assessors. This study focussed on the two stations in which communication skills are assessed in isolation from physical examination and where the skill of “<Emphasis Type="Italic">managing patients’ concerns”</Emphasis> is specifically assessed - station 2 (history taking) and at station 4 (communication skills and ethics). At these stations, trained actors (simulated patients (SP)) play the part of patients or their relatives and candidates are aware that one part of their task is to demonstrate the ability to detect, recognise and <Emphasis Type="Italic">manage patients’ concerns</Emphasis>. Two examiners, senior clinicians in the UK, directly observe and assess the candidate – SP interaction over a 14 min period.</Para>

                <Para ID="Par15">All candidates listed to sit the PACES examination over a two week period in the examination centre chosen for the study were mailed a month before the examination with information about the project, and an invitation to take part. On the day of the examination, full written consent was sought from candidates who had indicated an initial interest. All those that had consented were video-recorded at station 2 and station 4 over a two-week period in 2012. As one aspect of the study intended to focus on candidates who failed the examination, and this could not be known before the examination, 36 IMG’s performances were recorded. 28 IMGs failed “managing patients concerns” of which 21 outright failed (scored zero). The qualitative analyses of the recordings were related to these 21 candidates who failed the examination overall in addition to outright failing the “managing patients’ concerns” section at stations 2 and 4.</Para>

Two approaches were taken, one where large amount of information containing medical jargon was given, or explanations would be insufficient and vague. There was little involvement of the patient in the discussion, specifically exploring what the patient already knew, and the candidate tended to tell the SP what to do. These points are highlighted in a scenario involving a forty-five year old woman who was admitted with a severe attack of asthma. She had not been using her inhalers and was going through a stressful period in her life. She also smoked.<BlockQuote>

                <Heading>Summary of findings</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par114">In this study distinct reasons were found in the communication skills demonstrated by IMGs sitting the MRCP(UK) PACES examination which explained reasons for their failure in the skill of <Emphasis Type="Italic">managing patients’ concerns</Emphasis> and, more broadly, their ability to communicate in a general sense throughout the consultation. The themes identified in this study relate in particular to Hofstede’s cultural dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity/femininity (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef>) and are discussed in detail below.</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec15">
                <Heading>Power distance index</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par115">Characteristics of high power distance societies came across in the consultation styles of the IMGs in the themes ‘explanation and planning’ and ‘providing structure to the consultation’ which impacted on ‘building relationships’. IMG doctors appeared to control the consultation either by interrupting the patient, or taking responsibility away from the patient. The IMG doctors’ thought processes were not made explicit and the communication tended to be one-way. These findings are in keeping with Meeuwesen et al.’s cross-national study of communication between GPs and patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>]. They found that the larger a nation’s power distance the more fixed the roles of the doctor and patient, and the less room there was for unexpected information exchange: an attitude described as “doctor knows best” prevailed.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par116">Hofstede reports that in high power distance countries there is more reluctance to disagree with or question those in charge [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>]. IMGs who have trained in high power distance countries are more likely to see themselves in a position of responsibility, and more dissociated from the patient, as this is the cultural norm for them. Morrow et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>] found that the difference in power distance in the doctor - patient relationship was the largest difference reported by IMGs in their transition to working in the UK. IMGs from high power distance countries tended to position themselves as the experts. Although this may not provoke difficulty if both doctor and patient are from high power distance countries, this may not be the case when there is power-distance mismatch. Patients from lower power distance countries, as in this study, are more inquisitive and expect to be involved in their treatment and this may prove challenging to the doctor.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par117">IMGs in this study had difficulties detecting patients’ cues and addressing their concerns. This may suggest that these features are not a usual or expected aspect of medical consultations in those from high power societies. The hierarchical nature of high power distance societies may also encourage a more rigid style of consulting with little flexibility in the order of questioning as was observed in the current study.</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec16">
                <Heading>Uncertainty avoidance</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par118">High uncertainty avoiding countries tend to pay less attention to building rapport. This can be seen in the theme ‘building relationships’ and the difficulties observed with ‘detecting cues’ and ‘addressing concerns’. In a previous study, candidates from countries with a higher tolerance for uncertainty, had more eye contact and paid more attention to rapport building [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>]. In the current study IMGs, from countries with lower tolerance of uncertainty, tended not to answer questions posed directly to them, which often crystallised the patient’s concerns, and this may reflect difficulties in expressing diagnostic uncertainty. This has also been observed in a study on antibiotic prescribing, in which doctors from higher uncertainty avoiding countries issued more antibiotic prescriptions for self-limiting viral illnesses than those from lower uncertainty avoiding countries. This was suggested to mean that a “wait-and-see” or expectant approach would be interpreted by the patient as meaning that the doctor did not know the right answer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>]. In the PACES scenarios studied there was not necessarily, by design, any immediately available correct option or answer to the issues raised, and some IMGs appeared uncomfortable when difficult questions were posed to them, sometimes choosing not to answer the question at all. This may explain why IMGs generally tended to avoid the word “cancer”. The absence of a definitive diagnosis may create more uncertainty than some doctors are comfortable with, and avoiding any words which suggest cancer, or the word cancer itself, is a plausible method of minimising uncertainty. Asking patients’ opinions on management options, a central component of a “patient - centred” consultation, could be construed in a similar manner and may explain why IMGs tended not to use this approach.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par119">IMGs generally used a didactic style of conversation with patients and rapport also appeared to be hampered when an attempt to pick up cues from the patient, to which a patient responded, were not then fully explored. In consultations in which this was observed IMG doctors appeared to become fatigued by a patient-centred style of consulting and, perhaps simply because of pressure of time, reverted back to the doctor-centred style which may be more natural for them. If this is the case, those from high uncertainty avoiding societies may have more difficulty in building relationships in brief, time-pressured consultations, as the flexibility of a more patient-centred approach is outside their cultural norm. The more rigid consulting style often adopted by IMGS in this study appeared to make it more difficult to provide detailed explanation or approach shared planning with patients.</Para>

              <Section2 ID="Sec17">
                <Heading>Masculinity/Femininity</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par120">This dimension is associated with smaller differences in Hofstede scores across the range of countries of PMQ of the IMGs in this study (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab3">3</InternalRef>). IMG countries typically cluster around the middle of the range and the UK tends towards a more “masculine” society. Candidates may thus be expected to demonstrate fewer appreciable cultural differences on this dimension.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par121">The Hofstede framework suggests that doctors from more masculine societies may be expected to use more disease focused biomedical language, and place more emphasis on solving problems or curing patients. However, the IMG doctors in this study also used a significant amount of biomedical language. The impact of a candidate’s own sex upon these behaviours is not possible to ascertain but may be relevant. Meeuwesun et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>] also observed that disease oriented language was seen to be used in more <Emphasis Type="Italic">feminine</Emphasis> cultures and that IMGs also tended to omit the patient’s understanding, ideas, concerns and expectations, as was found throughout this study.</Para>

                <Heading>Strengths and limitations</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par122">This is the first study to explore Hofstede’s framework in a high stakes postgraduate clinical examination setting. There are a number of strengths and limitations to the current study. Firstly, the sample size of 10 video recordings is relatively small. The sample was also from a single examination site; consequently, the data may not be representative of a wider population.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par123">However, a sample recruited to a qualitative study is not usually intended to be representative of a larger population or to produce data that can be widely generalised. More important is the notion of ‘transferability’ of findings [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>] through the use of a theoretical framework.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par124">Secondly, it is important to note that Hofstede’s framework applies at a national or group level, rather than at the level of the individual and country-level preferences cannot be assigned to individual behaviour. Furthermore, Hofstede has not actually researched dimensions of <Emphasis Type="Italic">medicine</Emphasis> as a sub-culture within any one country. Despite the typical use of the Hofstede framework at an organisational level, this study has demonstrated its utility as a tool to interpret cultural factors at an individual level.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par125">Purposive sampling was used to maximise diversity in approaches to <Emphasis Type="Italic">managing patients’ concerns</Emphasis> in IMGs from a range of cultural backgrounds. Additionally, saturation was reached as no new themes emerged after analysis of eight recordings for the group.</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusions</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par126">In this study, IMGs who failed MRCP (UK) PACES, an examination created and assessed in the UK, and designed to ensure competence of practice in a UK setting, demonstrated consultation skills that were culturally different to the norms expected. The findings parallel differences that have been identified amongst IMGs working in the UK [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>]. Future research could investigate whether similar findings are echoed across all stations of the PACES examination and analyse a broader group of candidates from multiple examination centres.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par127">Hofstede’s framework may help us understand nations’ cultural norms and values in relation to examination performance and professional practice. In particular, power distance and uncertainty avoidance dimensions may predict areas where IMGs are more likely to have difficulty, and provide a rationale for why this may be the case. An understanding of this may help IMGs to understand what is meant by patient - centred care in UK medical practice, and to reflect on their earlier training environments and the effects of the cultural norms embedded within those environments on their current practice. An understanding of these differences may help us to narrow the attainment gap between UK Medical Graduates and IMGs in clinical and professional medical examinations. Our findings are likely to be of value to all doctors sitting the MRCP (UK) PACES examination, and be of interest to other Royal Colleges and their candidates who sit their face-to-face examinations in the UK.</Para>
