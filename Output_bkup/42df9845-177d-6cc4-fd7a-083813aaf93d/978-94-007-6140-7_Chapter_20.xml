              <Para TextBreak="No">Many demographers are already familiar with the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), conducted from 1991 forward (Buck et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">1994</CitationRef>). The BHPS has been heavily used by researchers within and outside the United Kingdom (UK) and by government departments, resulting in more than 150 publications per year. The potential for scientific advance has led to the UK Household Longitudinal Survey- (UKHLS). This new survey was modeled on the BHPS and is the largest and most ambitious panel survey in the world. We describe this new social and health survey and some of the opportunities it offers for research in demography and health.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The household panel design has proved extremely powerful in understanding the dynamics of populations and the determinants of behavior and outcomes at household and individual levels. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> is based on developments in this design going back to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) established in the USA in the late 1960s. It forms part of an international network of studies with currently active panels in the USA, Germany, Australia, Switzerland, South Africa, Israel, Canada, Korea, and other countries.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The initial support for <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> was raised by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) from the Large Facilities Capital Fund. The Large Facilities Capital Fund supports major scientific infrastructure, e.g., big telescopes. Funding of social science research resources is a recent departure. Additional funding was allocated by the ESRC from resources previously earmarked for a longitudinal study of ethnic minorities. Finally, there is support from a consortium of governmental departments including the Department of Work and Pensions, the Department for Education, the Department for Transport, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, the Department for Community and Local Government, the Scottish Government, the Welsh Assembly Government, the Department of Environment and Rural Affairs, and the Food Standards Agency.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The scientific leadership of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> is from the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER), University of Essex, with colleagues from the University of Warwick and the Institute of Education. The survey research organizations are National Centre for Social Research (NatCen), a large non-profit organization in London, and the Central Survey Unit of the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency of Belfast.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In establishing <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society:</Emphasis> the UK Household Longitudinal Study, the ESRC set out the following key aims:<BlockQuote>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">The Study will provide valuable new evidence about the people of the UK, their lives, experiences, behaviours and beliefs, and will enable an unprecedented understanding of diversity within the population. It will inform research on issues of importance to a wide scientific community of interest and will assist with understanding the long term effects of social and economic change, as well as of policy interventions designed to impact upon the general wellbeing of the UK population. (Background and aims of the UK Household Longitudinal Study, paper for the first meeting of the Governing Board)</Para>
                </BlockQuote>
              </Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">First, we briefly summarize the research agenda which may be pursued using <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis>, with an emphasis on its potential contributions to demography and health. This is followed by a description of the study design and data collection processes. We then describe the data from other sources that will augment the basic survey interviews. We conclude by describing how to access the data.</Para>
            </Section1>
            <Section1 ID="Sec2">
              <Heading>Research Agenda</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Seven attributes shape the research agenda that can be pursued using the UKHLS. The first three features relate to the basic design of the sample for the main survey.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec3">
                <Heading>Size of the Survey</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The survey’s large sample size is a key attribute. The target sample size of 40,000 households (approximately 100,000 persons) supports research for which many other surveys, in particular longitudinal surveys, have been too small. Demographers with applied interests may be interested in the ability to conduct detailed analyses at the regional or sub-regional levels. Many relatively rare events or subpopulations can be studied with the survey. As an example, with approximately 1,000 births per year, it will be possible to study births to teenaged mothers.</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec4">
                <Heading>A Survey of Households</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A second feature is the study’s household focus. Demographers have long studied population changes in the composition of households. Households make many key decisions related to consumption and life plans of its members. Household members also shape the behaviors of other members. A focus on households or related concepts of family structure provides a good opportunity to examine these mutual influences. For example, household panel surveys have contributed to the study of resident and non-resident parents and their contributions to outcomes of children (Ermisch <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2008</CitationRef>). They also permit examination of changing patterns in partnerships, such as dissolution and cohabitation, timings of marriages and births, and repartnering in relation to childbearing and employment outcomes.</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec5">
                <Heading>A Survey of All Ages</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A third feature is that the survey collects data on the full age range. Many other longitudinal studies in the UK are limited to a particular age range or cohort. The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (Marmot et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2003</CitationRef>), for example, is of persons aged 50 or older. There are several examples of birth cohort studies, defined with birth years of 1946, 1958 and 1970 (Ferri et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2003</CitationRef>). The newer Millennium Cohort Study has a sample of children born in 2000 (Dex and Joshi <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2005</CitationRef>). However, having data from household members of all ages will support a wide range of research and complement analyses conducted with age-specific studies such as the birth cohort studies.</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec6">
                <Heading>An Emphasis on Ethnicity Research</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">
                  <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> is also noteworthy for its ability to contribute to the understanding of ethnic minorities. The U.S. has a strong emphasis on race and ethnicity in its country’s official statistics and research. However, the UK did not collect census information on ethnicity until 1991 (Bradby <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2003</CitationRef>). The UK population can be characterized as having a relatively large number of minority groups each with small population shares. Study of ethnic variation in general population surveys requires over-representation, on samples, for minorities.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The UKHLS will provide important new information about ethnic minorities through oversampling of ethnic minorities and the collection of additional measurements relevant to their life experiences. These additional measures are asked of members of the boost sample (oversample), of members of ethnic minority groups not sampled as part of the boost sample, and by a comparison group of around 1,000 adults from the general population sample. Examples of the additional ethnicity-relevant measures include ethnic identity, discrimination and harassment, questions about ethnicity and social networks, and questions about remittances. The overall emphasis is on social and health outcomes of minority group members and on ethnic identity.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The questionnaire instruments and survey materials have been translated into nine languages: Bengali, Punjabi in Urdu and Gurmukhi scripts, Welsh, Arabic, Somali, Cantonese, Urdu, and Gujarati. Software development of the Language Management Utility (LMU) (Harkness <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">2005</CitationRef>) supports the work of multiple translators and is important for the CAPI scripting of non-Roman scripts and languages not read left to right. In the translated interviews, interviewers can toggle between English and the alternative questionnaire.</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec7">
                <Heading>Novel Measures and Methods of Data Collection</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The fifth and sixth features relate to the augmentation of conventional interview data with novel data collection methods and measures. The fifth feature is the combination of conventional interviewing with other data collection methods. Applied demographers may be particularly interested in the ability to make use of spatial data and linked administrative data. These data sources will be described in section “<InternalRef RefID="Sec16">Links to Other Types of Data</InternalRef>”.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">An Innovation Panel of approximately 1,500 households is a testbed for research related to longitudinal survey methods. It is intended to guide decisions about the study and contribute to longitudinal survey research methods in a realistic survey context similar to the general <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> design. Some of the research conducted with the Innovation Panel has included methodological experiments on incentives, alternative question working, and the use of dependent interviewing on measures of change (Burton et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR4">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec8">
                <Heading>Collection of Biomeasures</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The sixth feature is the collection of a relatively wide range of biomeasures and other health indicators. The study has been designed to support biomedical and social science research. Health scientists will find the study a rich source of information about social and economic factors that may influence health status at a single time point or may influence the trajectory of health outcomes. The particular markers included are relevant to risks of cardiovascular and metabolic conditions including diabetes and obesity, which are health problems of high policy interest as well as leading contributors to mortality and morbidity. Social scientists may wish to evaluate the effects of objective health measures on social resources and attainments. For example, there is utility to having objective health measures not influenced by the individual’s life circumstances, in contrast to self-reported health measures. There is also substantial interest in gene-environment linkages as potential explanations of behavior and disease etiology (Moffitt et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2006</CitationRef>; Hobcraft <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec9">
                <Heading>A Multi-topic Survey</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The combination of these features and a wide ranging process of consultation has contributed to a survey that will support broad ranging multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research. The research agenda of household panel studies has in the past focused particularly on issues of family dynamics and household organisation, household income and welfare, and labor market participation. The agenda has become broader, focusing on other issues including health and well-being, social participation, and a range of other behaviours. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> is extending this agenda yet further with for example questions tapping psychological attributes and attitudes related to environmental behaviors. As a multitopic survey aiming to support this broad range of research agendas, there is a clear need to prioritize measures within the questionnaires. Measures were selected to be useful in describing and explaining change at the individual and household levels and to provide breadth and balance of coverage in topic. The long-term content plan has questions that are asked each year, and question modules that rotate on various schedules. Questions are also triggered by events, e.g., moving, or by the respondent’s ages.</Para>

            <Section1 ID="Sec10">
              <Heading>Study and Sample Design</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">
                <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> has four sample components: (a) the general population sample, (b) the ethnic minority boost sample, (c) the innovation panel, and (d) the sample of participants from the BHPS. The sample designs are similar in having multistage sample designs mostly with stratification and clustering. However, each sample component has some unique features in its sample design.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec11">
                <Heading>General Population Sample Component</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The general population sample is a stratified, clustered, equal probability sample of residential addresses drawn to a uniform design throughout the whole of the UK (including north of the Caledonian Canal), with the exception of Northern Ireland, which is not clustered. The Primary Sampling Units (PSU’s) are postal sectors stratified by Government Office Region (GOR), population density, and minority ethnic density. 2,640 postal sectors were selected systematically with probability proportional to size (number of addresses). Within each sampled sector, 18 addresses were selected systematically, resulting in an equal-probability sample of a total of 47,520 addresses in Great Britain. In Northern Ireland, 2,400 addresses were selected systematically from the Land and Property Services Agency list of domestic properties, thus making a total of 49,920 selected addresses in UK. The overall sample was allocated to 24 monthly sub-samples, each independently representative of the UK population.</Para>

                <Heading>Ethnic Minority Boost Sample Component</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The goal for the ethnic minority boost sample was to provide samples of at least 1,000 adults in each of the five largest ethnic minority groups: Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Caribbean, and African. Such a sample would support group specific analyses of these ethnic groups (Berthoud et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2010</CitationRef>). While the sampling targets are defined in terms of numbers of adults, the sample is of households.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The sampling approach first identifies geographic areas with at least 5 % density of ethnic minority groups. Because the 2001 Census was becoming outdated, the density estimates were adjusted using more recent survey estimates. The high density sectors (at least 5 % of their adult population in minority groups) were 36 % of the total sectors and accounted for 85 % of all members of minorities. Further subsampling of the high density areas was done to increase the efficiency of the yield. That is, a higher sampling fraction was used for areas anticipated to yield three or more households while successively smaller fractions were used for areas expected to yield two, one or zero households (Berthoud et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">At selected addresses, households were screened for the presence of a member of a minority ethnic group. The screening question is, “Do you come from or have parents or grandparents who come from any of the following ethnic groups?” The response categories are Indian, mixed Indian, Pakistan, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan, Caribbean/West Indian, Mixed Caribbean/West Indian, North African, Black African, African Asian, Chinese, Far Eastern, Turkish, Middle Eastern/Iranian, or other. At the screening stage all households with the smaller ethnic groups are selected and there is some deselection of larger groups, e.g., Indians (Berthoud et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Following the first 6 months of data collection the procedures were reviewed and modified. One change was to increase the number of addresses issued in areas estimated to be high in Bangladeshi. This is the smallest of the five main ethnic groups.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">One result of the screening procedure is that people from North Africa and the Middle East, who are sometimes recorded as ‘white’ will be included with the boost sample, the former within the African category. Thus the proposed screening question identifies persons in the following categories in addition to the five target groups: Chinese, other Far Eastern, Sri Lankan, and Middle Eastern. While it is useful to be able to identify members of these ethnic groups, the number of cases will be well below 1,000. White minorities are not selected in the screening but can be identified by survey questions in the general sample.</Para>

                    <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> incorporates the BHPS sample members into the overall sample design. The extensive longitudinal data of the BHPS has great scientific value, including the opportunity for early longitudinal analyses of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis>. The BHPS was a random sample of Great Britain excluding the Scottish Highlands and Islands. In its first wave in 1991 it achieved a sample of 5,500 households. Boost samples of Scotland and Wales were added in 1999 and of Northern Ireland in 2001. These modifications were motivated by interest in analyses in these countries related to political changes associated with devolution in the UK.</Para>
                  <Para TextBreak="No">Wave 18, the last wave of the BHPS, was conducted in 2008.

                <Heading>The Innovation Panel</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The final sample component is the Innovation Panel (IP). The purpose of the IP is to test methods of data collection and data collection instruments relevant to the conduct of the main survey. As far as practical it has identical design and procedures as the other samples. Its sample design began with 2,760 households drawn from 120 areas of Britain. Northern Ireland and Scotland north of the Caledonian Canal are not included.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The achieved wave 1 sample was targeted at 40,000 households: approximately 26,000 from the general population sample, 4,000 from the ethnic minority boost, 1,500 from the Innovation Panel, and 8,400 from the BHPS participants. The overall sample design is complex and researchers may wish to use the data in a variety of ways. Consequently, the weighting strategy is also complex to support such uses as cross-sectional analyses, calendar year analyses, and longitudinal analyses involving one or more of the sample components.</Para>

              <Heading>Data Collection</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">This section describes some important features of the study in relation to data collection. It includes the timing of data collection, following rules for the continuity and maintenance of the longitudinal sample, modes of data collection, and description of the survey instruments and topics.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">
                <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> is a household panel survey with annual measurements. A sample of households is selected, data are collected from all adult household members, and sample members are followed in subsequent years. Each wave is collected over 2 years or 24 months, such that the first wave of data was collected between January 2009 and December 2011. The second wave of data collection began in January 2010 with those interviewed in the first month of the first wave and concluded in December 2012 with those interviewed in the last month of the first wave. The IP is collected in the spring of the year before the main survey wave.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Households are the first stage of sampling, and household composition determines the rules for following individual respondents over time. The individuals found at selected households in the first wave were designated as Original Sample Members (OSM). We attempt to maintain OSM respondents as part of the sample as long as they live in the UK. Individuals joining the household of an OSM after the sample selection/first interview are temporary sample members (TSM). However, births to an OSM become an OSM. We attempt to interview TSM participants in successive waves as long as they live in the household of an OSM. TSMs are not followed for interviews when they leave the household, but OSMs are.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The following rules mimic the demographic processes by which population is reproduced, including births and deaths, partnership formations and dissolutions, and emigration. The one exception is that there is no direct way in which the following rules capture immigrants into the UK. With this exception, the sample remains representative of the UK as it changes over time, subject to weighting for attrition. The sampling of new immigrants remains an issue to be decided in the future development of the study.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Most of the data collection uses computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). There are several instruments for members in selected households. The structure is similar to the BHPS. The basic structure has a household interview and completion of the household grid conducted with one member of the household. The household questionnaire is about 15 min. Each person aged 16 or older has the individual adult interview and self-completed questionnaire. The individual interview is approximately 30 min. There is also an 8 min self-completion interview for adults. Youth aged 10–15 are asked to respond to a self-completion questionnaire, which is a paper and pencil instrument. Information about younger children is provided by the responsible parent in the household and adult interviews. There is a brief proxy interview about adults unable to be interviewed.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The content plan balances having a broader range of information with reducing the burden of data collection. Content that is asked of all respondents is either annual or rotating. Compared to the BHPS there is a greater use of rotating question modules. Modules can also be done by subsets defined by age or other status characteristics. For example, a module on parenting styles in Wave 3 is asked of parents with children of specific ages. Other content is triggered by events such as birth of a child, marriage, or migration. (The long term content plan can be found at <ExternalRef>
                  <RefSource>www.understandingsociety.org.uk</RefSource>
                  <RefTarget Address="http://www.understandingsociety.org.uk" TargetType="URL"/>
                </ExternalRef>.)</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The initial three waves of data collection are face to face, a mode of administration that is typically more costly but more likely to reduce attrition when we are establishing the study. An experiment in the second wave of the IP compared groups issued to face-to-face interviewing vs. those initially issued to telephone administration with varied procedures for interviewing outstanding household members in face-to-face (Burton et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">2010</CitationRef>). This experiment has provided information about the reduction in response rates and costs of different interviewing options. Implementation of multi-mode data collection will move forward in Waves 4 or 5.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The household level response rate of 59.2 % is in line with the target rate of 60 %. This rate is typical for surveys of this sort in the UK. The target for household response rate in Wave 2 is greater than 80 % and for Wave 3 is greater than 90 %.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Ethical review in the UK is frequently conducted by external organizations. For health research, this is done through the National Research Ethics Service (NRES) of the National Health Service. This arrangement is congruent with the NHS’s dominance of health care delivery. In addition, research centres and professional societies frequently adopt an ethical framework. ISER has adopted the framework of the Social Research Association (Social Research Association <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2003</CitationRef>), and the ESRC has published a detailed framework of research ethics (Economic and Social Research Council <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2010</CitationRef>). In addition, universities organize ethical committees for the research of faculty and staff. <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> has received ethical approval for research related to the first three waves of the study from a local research ethics committee of the NRES.</Para>

              <Heading>Links to Other Types of Data</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The ability to link <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> survey data with other data sources is a central goal for the study. The added data will greatly enhance its scientific research capacity.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec17">
                <Heading>Administrative Data</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Linkages with administrative data can be used to supplement the interview data and reduces respondent burden by adding data that would otherwise be collected in the interview or is a potential source of validation for the survey data (Calderwood and Lessof <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2009</CitationRef>). Respondents were asked in Wave 1 for consents to link health and educational administrative records for themselves and for their children. The health records are held by the National Health Service (NHS), the NHS Central Registers, the Departments of Health, the General Registration Office, and the Office for National Statistics. Consent to link to education records was requested of parents of children aged 4–15 and by young adults aged 16–24 who were currently attending school or had attended school in the UK in the past.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Because of this volume’s emphasis on public health, we will describe the health data linkages. For those who consented, fields from their survey data will be sent to the NHS to establish a flag in the Central Register. The Central Register records the registration of the individual with a general practitioner and is frequently updated following births, moves, name changes, and major events like marriages and deaths. With the flag established, the study will be notified when the Central Register is updated for a study participant. In addition, we will link to medical records like the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). The type of data in HES includes dates of the episode, information about the facility, procedures and treatments, diagnoses, and waiting times. The data systems in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland vary somewhat but similar procedures will be followed for the linkages.</Para>

                <Heading>Spatial Data</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">While this information is not publicly released, participants’ postal codes can be used to identify several geographic variables that are released. Postal codes in each wave can be linked to geographic designations of interest including parliamentary constituencies, local educational authorities, travel to work areas, local authority districts, and primary care trusts. Parliamentary constituencies are geographic areas used to elect members of Parliament. Local authority districts are local governments units which have some social service responsibilities. The education department of a local authority district is frequently referred to as a local educational authority. Primary care trusts are responsible for providing health services to an area and contracting for additional services such as hospitals. The travel to work areas are similar to classifications set up by the U.S. Census for commuting distances. The rural–urban classification categorizes localities by population size and the sparseness of surrounding areas. For a useful description of these geographical classifications see A Beginners’ Guide to UK Geographies (Office for National Statistics <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2010</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Biomeasures</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Biomeasures have been included in several major longitudinal surveys, including the 1946 and 1958 British Cohort studies (Ferri et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">2003</CitationRef>), and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) (Marmot et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">2003</CitationRef>). The addition of biomeasures to <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> permits the examination of objective biological, anthropometric, and functional measures within a large sample that spans many ages and that can be studied within a household context. The measurement of biomarkers in BHPS participants will permit researchers to examine questions that rely on longitudinal psycho-social data immediately.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Collection of the biomeasures began with some components of the Wave 2 general population sample of adults. Data collection was conducted in a separate visit by trained nurses. The measures include anthropometric information (height, weight, waist circumference, and body fat from bioelectrical impedance), blood pressure, lung function (spirometry), grip strength, and the collection of whole blood through venepuncture. The blood analytes are total cholesterol, high density lipids, c-reactive protein, cystatin-c, and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C). Respondents were asked to provide written consent to store blood for future research and to conduct genetic studies.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">In the longer term <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> will be significantly enriched by the collection of a wider range of data that will help address research issues that questionnaire data on its own cannot address. Examples include using the survey data as a sampling frame for longitudinal qualitative research, the use of diaries to collect more accurate measurement such as time use information or specific health behaviours, and experiments to test specific hypotheses. An example of a structured experiment is an experiment on trust (Uhrig et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">The first data release took place in late 2010 and included Wave 1, year 1 data and the first two waves of the Innovation Panel. Subsequently, full waves of data have been released yearly.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The data are released through the UK Data Archive (UKDA). The UKDA is the curator of the largest collection of digital data in the social sciences in the UK. Its staff is experienced in the preservation and dissemination of data resources. In particular, the UKDA collaborates with ISER in the Longitudinal Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The UKDA has different levels of data security. In the usual case, researchers register with the ESDS and agree to the conditions of the regular End User License. The chief conditions are to not use the data to attempt to discover the identity of individuals or households in the data set and to follow the requirements of the Data Protection Act (Information Commissioner <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2001</CitationRef>). Researchers are also asked to report publications resulting from the data.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Somewhat higher levels of restriction (Conditional Access) are used for data with greater but still small risk of disclosure. These include geocoded data to relatively large geographic units such as Primary Care Trusts. Special Access is required for data with greater risk of personal disclosure, often because the geographic units are smaller. Such units include census wards.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Finally, the UKDA has implemented a Secure Data Service for data with greater sensitivity. Examples of this would be the survey data linked with administrative health or education records.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Entirely new procedures must be established to permit access to biological samples for genetic research by qualified researchers. Not only are these data considered sensitive but the biological samples are a limited resource.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Documentation is maintained both at the UKDA and on the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> webpage. Documentation includes study- and variable-level information, specific guides about major content areas such as the biomeasures or cognitive measures, and guides for issues that are frequently problematic for users such as selection of appropriate weights.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A research conference for the BHPS and <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis> was held in 2011 and subsequently in odd-numbered years. The conference is an opportunity to present research findings and methodological research to others using the studies’ data and to network with the study investigators.

                <Emphasis Type="Italic">Understanding Society</Emphasis>, the UKHLS, is a new household panel survey funded by the UK ESRC and multiple UK governmental departments.
