          <Para>Weed control is perhaps the earliest intervention made by human beings for increasing crop production in the history of agricultural development. With time, the principle of weed control expanded from its physical mode to cultural methods, and then the inventions of selective herbicides during mid-twentieth century initiated a new era of weeding measure in the agricultural crop fields. The economic and environmental concerns subsequently caused a shift in the focus from mere weed control to concepts of weed management. The never-ceasing demand for higher crop yield for fulfilling the need of an ever-increasing human population, global climate change, increase in international trade of agricultural produce, introduction of genetically modified crops, and greater emphasis on conservation agriculture are some of the challenges expected to redefine the agricultural production systems across the geopolitical boundaries. Weed management, being an integral part of crop production system, and also being one of the major contributors toward production costs as well as produce quality, must be resilient enough to cope with the requirements of highly variable emerging agricultural scenarios across diverse agroclimatic situations, to make the future agricultural production systems economically sustainable. On the other hand, increased environmental concerns, development of herbicide resistance in weeds, weed flora shift, and stringent quarantine laws are some other hurdles the weed scientists will have to address while developing weed management package of practices. Integrated approaches involving site-specific weed management using precise delivery techniques, controlled release formulations of herbicides, and weed competitive crop cultivars with allelopathic potentials are some of the possibilities that need comprehensive exploration.</Para>

          <Para>The world’s population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Meeting the food requirements of this huge population will not be easy. The farmers around the world will have to produce higher yields, and simultaneously will have to give attention to a fragile environment<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Environment</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> and conserve the valuable resources of land and water. Further, population growth and economic development will result in more demand for meat and other animal products as well as fruits and vegetables [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. Presently, about one-third of global cereal production is used as animal feed to obtain eggs, dairy products, and meat [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>], and due to this increased demand for animal products, the world will face an increased pressure on cropland, fossil fuel energy, and water [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. It is estimated that food production will need to increase by 50–100 % to support the growing and changing population [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>].</Para>
          <Para>Agriculture is characterized by unique combinations of soil, climate, topography, hydrology, and biological diversity, as well as a diversity of crops and production systems. A single farming system or approach will not be able to best feed the planet, while also protecting the environment, because of the enormous variation in agroecological circumstances across the planet as well as unpredictable weather and market conditions. A wide diversity of crops, livestock, and farming systems will help promote resilience, and will likely play a key role in future food and ecosystem security. Hence, like any other farming activities, weed management under diversified farming systems will require flexible, adaptive, and localized management systems that cannot be covered by one-size-fits-all policies. This chapter deals with the probable future agricultural scenario and consequent challenges in weed science research.</Para>

          <Heading>What do Weeds Cause?</Heading>
          <Para>Weeds have been known to humans since the very beginning of civilization. The term “weed” is used to describe a plant considered undesirable within a certain context, and usually applied to unwanted plants in human-controlled settings, viz. farm fields, gardens, lawns, and parks. The word weed does not carry any significance in relation to botanical classification, since a plant that is a weed in one context is not a weed in another context where it is wanted. For example, Bermuda grass (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Cyanodon dactylon</Emphasis>), unlike in crop fields, is not a weed in lawns where it is grown and nurtured. In an agricultural field, all other plants except those grown with an aim to harvest are termed as weeds. Thus, a weed may be defined as “any plant that is objectionable or interferes with the activities or welfare of man” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. Despite several modern weed control technologies developed with an aim to keep weeds under control, they are still a threat to agricultural productivity [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]. Weed management is more than control of existing weed problems and places greater emphasis on preventing weed reproduction, reducing weed emergence after crop planting, and minimizing weed competition with the crop [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>].</Para>
          <Para>Weed science<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Weed science</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> is an integrative, applied scientific discipline typical of most other pest management and production-oriented disciplines of modern agriculture [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. It combines fundamental and applied sciences to study weeds, and focuses on mitigating the negative impacts of weeds in human-controlled settings, especially in agricultural production systems. Purdue University described weed science as “the study of vegetation management in agriculture, aquatics, horticulture, and right-of-way, essentially anywhere plants need to be managed. It involves the study of all the tools available for this purpose, such as cropping systems, herbicides, management techniques, and seed genetics. It is not just the controlling of plants, but the study of these plants. This includes plant ecology, physiology, and the genetics of plants species that have been identified to have impact on the economy and our ecology” [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. Weed scientists focus their research on basic biological and ecological characteristics of weeds, and develop tools and tactics to reduce weeds and their effects in crops, rangelands, forest plantations, roadsides, and aquatic environments [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>].</Para>
          <Para>Weeds can effectively compete for nutrient, water, space, and light and thereby can irreversibly harm the desired plants in agricultural and horticultural farming systems<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Horticultural crops</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>. Besides that, weeds may directly or indirectly affect the management of all the terrestrial and aquatic resources and interfere with the values and activities of people belonging to various segments of society, viz. foresters, ranchers, etc. Some routinely encountered negative impacts of weeds in human-controlled settings and managed ecosystems are listed in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">16.1</InternalRef>.</Para>

          <Para>The competitive ability of weeds is determined by several plant characteristics. One of the most common traits of a weed species is its tendency to be an annual or biennial, rather than a perennial; this allows the species a faster reproduction rate leading to a higher fecundity [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. Another characteristic that determines the “weediness” of a species is the ability to colonize under high sunlight and low soil moisture conditions. Plants that have capabilities of dealing with herbivores as well as plants that have allelopathic traits tend to be better at outcompeting surrounding plant species. Some non-native species of plants are considered to be very weedy in nature, as they can grow faster and bigger, increase reproduction rates, and can have increased survival rates when outside of their native habitat. This may be due, in part, to the loss of environmental checks needed to keep these plants in balance within their natural habitat. Genetic makeup also determines the ability of a plant to become weedy in nature; however, a genetic pattern has yet to be described [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. In India, out of the total 826 reported weed species, 80 species are considered as very serious and 198 as serious weeds.</Para>

However, weed control received little attention or research efforts until the late 1800s and early 1900s, and for centuries, weed control has been accomplished as a by-product of seedbed preparation. Agricultural mechanization efforts largely ignored weed control implements until 1914 when the rodweeder was introduced primarily for weed control [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. Even the modern hoe, which is synonymous with weed control, was specifically designed by Jethro Tull to break up the soil to make nutrients more readily available to the crop’s roots [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. Early methods of weed control include labor-intensive hand hoeing and hand pulling of weeds as well as cultural practices, such as crop rotation. Although <Emphasis Type="Italic">hoe-hands</Emphasis> are rare in developed countries, hand removal of weeds remains the dominant form of weed control in many undeveloped nations. Rotation practices were largely replaced by monoculture systems and chemical weed control by the 1940s [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. However, in recent times, crop rotation has again become an integral part of weed management in organic farming as well as integrated weed management (IWM)<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

In fact the study of weeds as a science began with the introduction of phytotoxic chemicals for the control of weeds in the early 1900s [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">12</CitationRef>]. The first chemical used to control weeds was inorganic copper salt, which was then followed by sulfuric acid. Thus, the history of weed science parallels the history of modern agriculture and is hardly 100 years old [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. Planned weed-controlled opportunities, and thus the birth of weed science as a discipline, took place with the synthesis of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) in 1941 by Pokorny, followed by the discovery of its plant growth-regulating and herbicidal properties by Hammer and Tukey in 1944 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

            </IndexTerm>. This is the first account of a synthesized organic chemical used to control weeds [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>]. Weed science received a major boost as a valid scientific discipline with the commercial acceptance of 2,4-D as an effective herbicide. Until this point, research was limited in funding as well as in interest by the scientific community; those who did dare tackle questions about weed control did so neither with the chance of recognition nor with insight from previous research. When 2,4-D appeared in the market, it offered users a cheaper option of weed control that could be applied at relatively low rates and in many agricultural settings [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>]. The characteristics of 2,4-D offered hope that chemical weed control could revolutionize global food production, in turn, drawing a great deal of attention to weed control research. The success story of 2,4-D led to an explosion of synthesized herbicides during the 1940s and 1950s. By 1950, there were roughly 25 herbicides available for use [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. By the 1960s, more than 120 effective herbicides were available for weed management, which were enough to ensure that chemical weed control was a viable replacement of labor-intensive mechanical weed removal. Thus, weed science was guaranteed a spot among respected subsets of agricultural sciences<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Para>Introduction of glyphosate to the herbicide market in the year 1974, and subsequent development of glyphosate-resistant soybean and its commercialization in 1996, initiated a new era in modern weed science, similar to that of 2,4-D discovery [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]. This technology allowed the use of a non-selective herbicide within a row crop setting without injury to the resistant crop. This gave farmers the freedom of using a hassle-free means to control weeds in their fields as and when it was desired. Presently, attempts are being made to design an herbicide-resistant crop that contains resistance to multiple non-selective herbicides. If it becomes a reality, this feat would allow farmers greater flexibility in herbicide choice, reduce dependency on a single herbicide, and also reduce the apprehension with respect to probable evolution of glyphosate-resistant “super weed” species<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Para>Much advancement has been achieved in weed control since the beginning of modern weed science research. These achievements came through several complications and defeats; however, advancements have still been made and improved weed control methods have allowed farmers to witness dramatic increases in crop yield. In view of the continuous increase in world population and diminishing availability of agricultural land, it is imperative that the research in weed management progress further with the changing agricultural needs to guarantee adequate food for ourselves and posterity.</Para>
          <Para>The main reason behind widespread adoption of herbicides in the industrially developed countries was socialistic, through a reduction in the need for labor and the concomitant release of people from farming [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. Chemical weed control offered several benefits to farmers by reducing weeds, enabling early planting, reducing need for soil tillage, and providing economic advantages through reduced cost of production. However, it was not the only tool to manage weeds. The disadvantage associated with herbicide techniques is the development of herbicide resistance in weeds. The wheat growers in the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana suffered a lot during the late 1990s and early years of the last decade due to the development of isoproturon resistance in <Emphasis Type="Italic">Phalaris minor,</Emphasis> a major weed of this region. The problem persisted until alternative herbicides to control this weed became available in the market. The researchers developed and fine-tuned several other strategies to manage weeds to deal with various social, cultural, environmental, and economic issues. All those weed management strategies are typically grouped into five categories: preventive, cultural, mechanical (physical), biological, and chemical.</Para>

For example, weeds serve as alternative hosts for plant-parasitic nematodes, thereby reducing the success of certain nematode management strategies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR57">57</CitationRef>]. Herbicides used for weed control may exert an effect on plant diseases, as weeds may serve as alternate hosts to pathogenic fungi and nematodes in fields [<CitationRef CitationID="CR58">58</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR59">59</CitationRef>] that damage crops. Further, herbicides may also alter the ability of crop plants toward their response to pathogens.

According to Norris and Kogan [<CitationRef CitationID="CR61">61</CitationRef>], there are three types of interaction mechanisms: (1) weeds act as a food source for insect-pests or predators; (2) weeds may alter habitat, which may thus increase or suppress insect infestations<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Weed–nematode interactions in agricultural production systems may be more intricate and complex than the simple function of weeds as alternative hosts [<CitationRef CitationID="CR62">62</CitationRef>].

              </IndexTerm>. Global climate change is likely to cause a widespread shift in patterns of photosynthetic limitation in higher plants [<CitationRef CitationID="CR63">63</CitationRef>]. In a recent review, Yamori et al. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR64">64</CitationRef>] found that the inherent ability for temperature acclimation of photosynthesis was different: (1) among C3, C4, and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) species and (2) among functional types within C3 plants. These authors have concluded that C3 plants generally had a greater ability for temperature acclimation of photosynthesis across a broad temperature range; CAM plants acclimated day and night photosynthetic process differentially to temperature, and C4 plants adapted to warm environments. Hence, the long-term threat of increasing temperature and CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> concentration on crop–weed interaction<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
                <Primary>Crop-weed interaction</Primary>
              </IndexTerm> should be viewed seriously, since a majority of crops belong to C3, whereas large numbers of weeds belong to the C4 category. C4 plants will have an advantageous position over C3 plants (e.g., rice) under higher temperatures and limited water availability. On the contrary, elevated CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> levels will improve the competitiveness of C3 crops relative to C4 weeds. Increased atmospheric CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> levels may also improve tolerance of rice against parasitic weeds, while prevalence of parasitic species may be amplified by soil degradation and more frequent droughts or floods [<CitationRef CitationID="CR65">65</CitationRef>]. Climate change is expected to promote a proliferation of new weed species and cause shifts in the composition of weed flora, especially in the tropics and subtropics. As weeds are highly dynamic and adapt quickly to new conditions, the management solutions have to address an ever-changing scenario.

            <Para>Changes from conventional to conservation farming practices often lead to weed flora shift in the crop field, which in turn also dictate the requirement of a new weed management technology. As the density of certain annual and perennial weeds increases under CA, effective weed control techniques are required to manage weeds successfully. The development of post-emergence broad-spectrum herbicides immensely ushered the way of controlling weeds in CA-based systems. However, weeds are still a big constraint toward the adoption of CA, and there is a need for developing more effective and economic IWM practices in diversified cropping systems by including various approaches, viz. preventive measures, cultural practices, and herbicides. There is a need to carry out an analysis of factors affecting adoption and acceptance of no-tillage agriculture among farmers. A lack of information on the effects and interactions of minimal soil disturbance, permanent residue cover, planned crop rotations, and IWM, which are key CA components, can hinder CA adoption [<CitationRef CitationID="CR78">78</CitationRef>]. This is because these interactions can have positive and negative effects, depending on regional conditions. The positive impacts should be exploited through system research to enhance CA crop yields. Information has mostly been generated on the basis of research trials, and more on-farm-level research and development is needed. Farmers’ involvement in participatory research and demonstration trials can accelerate adoption of CA, especially in the areas where CA is a new technology<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Organically cultivated fields show higher levels of weed infestation compared to conventional agriculture [<CitationRef CitationID="CR92">92</CitationRef>], and it is a big challenge to make the non-chemical methods of weed control effective and economical. Mechanical approaches, generally used to manage weeds in this system, provide lower weed control efficiency than herbicides [<CitationRef CitationID="CR93">93</CitationRef>]. But at some instances, weed harrowing may provide yields similar to weed-free situations [<CitationRef CitationID="CR94">94</CitationRef>]. Soil solarization may be a useful tool in nurseries and in high-value crops under organic agriculture; it is not yet a practicable option for field crops due to high cost. Although <Emphasis Type="Italic">P. minor</Emphasis> was controlled in wheat to some extent by using ZT technology in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, such success has not been achieved in other crops and weed species<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Plant allelochemical or essential oil-based organic herbicides are available commercially, but these are very expensive and are utilized mainly for spot applications in a field to deal with a localized infestation of noxious weeds [<CitationRef CitationID="CR95">95</CitationRef>]. Currently, no bioherbicides based on specific plant pathogens<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

Incorporation of <Emphasis Type="Italic">Sesbania</Emphasis> grown as an intercrop (brown manuring) in upland direct-seeded rice can be adopted for managing weeds and obtaining higher productivity. Enhancing a crop’s competitive ability by integrating both cultural and mechanical weed control methods is a key strategy in organic systems, but the relative efficacy of different cultural and mechanical strategies and their interactions and additive effects when combined is not well known [<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>].

            <Para>Although the risk of entry is minimized by quarantine arrangements, an increased exchange of grains and seeds following globalization of agricultural trade is expected to further enhance the probability of entry of weeds in a new territory. For example, there are several weeds of invasive nature existing in different parts of the world, but they are not in India (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">16.2</InternalRef>) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR103">103</CitationRef>]<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

The sanitary and phytosanitary agreement of the World Trade Organization (WTO) suggests that the countries should not only update their quarantine laws but also incorporate the elements of pest-risk analysis for making regulatory decisions for both import and export. Therefore, there is an urgent need to analyze the risk factor associated with different exotic weeds to design safeguards and to lower the risk of their entry. Many countries like Australia, New Zealand, and the USA have developed strong protocols for weed risk analysis and for identification of quarantine weeds. Similarly, other countries of the world should strengthen their capacity on weed risk analysis and develop more stringent guidelines and standards for prevention<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">

          <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
          <Para>The dynamic nature of weed populations makes them a never-ending problem in crop fields. The cropping environment and the production practices—viz. crop rotation, tillage, fertilization<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Fertilization</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, crop spacing, herbicides, irrigation<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Irrigation</Primary>
            </IndexTerm>, etc.—together dictate the nature and intensity of weed infestation. Accordingly, various approaches of weed management have evolved in the history of weed science<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>History</Primary>
              <Secondary>weed science</Secondary>
            </IndexTerm>. Because of the complexity and diversity of weed communities, application of a given control tactic leads to a weed population shift, thereby compelling the grower to use another tactic, and the cycles go on. This situation demands the use of integrated approaches involving more than one control tactic to favor the crop in its competition over weeds for natural resources.</Para>
          <Para>The growing demand for food grains and other agricultural products on one hand and the shrinking availability of agricultural land on the other hand are already the burning<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Burning</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> problems being faced by agriculture. Further, climate change is predicted to affect precipitation rates and patterns, which will consequently affect temperature, growing season, soil moisture levels, and other critical agricultural production factors. All these developments are expected to force the growers to shift toward highly intensive production systems using newer production technologies. Weeds, being highly complex and competitive, and due to their wild and dynamic nature, are expected to adapt and remain a problem in the future production systems, and will necessarily create demand for newer integrated control tactics. Moreover, the way in which the interaction of weeds with crops and other pests will move under the changing climate is yet a domain of unknown probabilities. Developing innovative and economical weed management tactics to make more diverse and integrated approach of weed management for the future cropping systems is a great challenge and a continuous process for weed scientists.</Para>
          <Para>Availability of herbicides simplified the weed management and benefitted the agricultural community in many ways, viz. timely weeding, overcoming the problem of labor shortage, reducing production cost, etc. However, the over-reliance on herbicides has already shown its consequences in the form of weed resistance to herbicides, and adoption of HTCs<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Herbicide tolerant crops (HTCs)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> may further exuberate such a situation. Hence, the challenge is to manage herbicides in a manner that prevents adapted weed species from reaching troublesome proportions. Development of site-specific weed management<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Site-specific weed management (SSWM)</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> systems is another challenge to be sorted out to reduce herbicide consumption and also to reduce the environmental impact of herbicides by preventing herbicide load where it is not required.</Para>
          <Para>Present-day agriculture is also facing the problem of transborder movement of weed seeds being accompanied by the growing international trade of agricultural produce. It is of greater concern if the alien species are obnoxious and invasive in nature. Risk assessment and developing management tactics for such weeds in a newer environment<IndexTerm Type="Keyword">
              <Primary>Environment</Primary>
            </IndexTerm> are always a challenge.</Para>
          <Para>Technology dissemination is as important as technology development. Minimum attention has been paid by the growers toward adoption of new weed management practices as compared to the adoption of other production technologies (viz. seeds and fertilizers), which is a matter of concern for the weed scientists.</Para>
