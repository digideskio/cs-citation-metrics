            <Para TextBreak="No">The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved more than ten drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer, which include hormonal, supportive, and cytotoxic agents. Although these drugs have remarkably improved the management of patients with the disease, new treatments are greatly needed for achieving better clinical outcomes. Regulatory evaluation of newer agents under development is highly challenging, especially for agents intended for patients with advanced metastatic disease resistant to castration and/or docetaxel. Substantial evidence of efficacy and safety must be demonstrated for an agent to receive marketing approval. The evidence must be based on adequate, well-designed, and well-conducted clinical trials that provide quantitative assessments of measured clinical benefits and risks of the agent. Although improvements in survival and/or patient-reported outcomes continue to be valid endpoints for approving new claims or agents, effective surrogates that can reliably measure and predict clinical benefit remain to be established for accelerating drug development for the disease. Furthermore, appropriate utilization of trial results is very important. Subgroup analysis and/or post-hoc analysis results are not acceptable for regulatory action in general. Productive collaboration between all stakeholders and the agency is one of the keys for successful development of prostate cancer treatments.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">Medical treatment of prostate cancer dates back to the well-known landmark findings in the 1940s that androgen deprivation, achieved through either orchiectomy or estrogen administration, can retard advanced prostate cancer and alleviate disease-related symptoms. From a regulatory perspective, effective modern drug management of prostate cancer began with the approval of leuprolide for palliative treatment of prostate cancer in 1985 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1_35">1</CitationRef>]. Since then, more than ten drugs have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of the disease. These drugs can be classified into three groups: hormonal agents, cytotoxic agents, and supportive agents. Currently, many agents are under development for the disease, especially for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).<Footnote ID="Fn1_35">
                <Para TextBreak="No">CRPC denotes the progressive recurrent disease setting of prostate cancer despite the low plasma levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dL) achieved by medical or surgical castration, a clinical phenomenon that is historically defined as androgen-independent or hormone-refractory prostate cancer. CRPC becomes well accepted now in that it is more conceptually appropriate than the other terms in reflecting the nature of the disease setting. Therefore, CRPC will be used in the review wherever a description of the disease setting is needed.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">In this chapter, we will review the general FDA approval process for anticancer drugs, summarize the approved drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer with an emphasis on the drugs approved in the last decade, and discuss the current challenges in evaluating new drugs being developed.</Para>

            <Heading>General FDA Approval Process for Anticancer Drugs</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In the United States, FDA regulates all commercial marketing claims of therapeutic products. Since the passage of the Federal Food and Drugs Act in 1906, the requirements for approval of a product have evolved with the enactment of several legislative initiatives. Substantial evidence of safety and efficacy must be demonstrated prior to drug approval [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2_35">2</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR3_35">3</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Anticancer drugs are reviewed by the Office of Oncology Drug Products (OODP) in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (<ExternalRef>
                <RefSource>http://www.fda.gov/cder/Offices/OODP</RefSource>
                <RefTarget Address="http://www.fda.gov/cder/Offices/OODP" TargetType="URL"/>
              </ExternalRef>). The OODP-regulated products include traditionally termed “drugs” and biologic anticancer products (antibodies and oligonucleotides). OODP is engaged in all stages of clinical development, from evaluating and advising on presubmissions of an investigational new drug (IND) application, INDs, the design and conduct of trials oriented for a new drug application (NDA), and NDA submissions, to approval of anticancer drugs, following up on postmarketing commitments, assisting further postmarketing development, and monitoring safety of marketed drugs.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Experimental drugs must be developed under an IND application prior to marketing approval. Regulatory evaluation objectives vary with the stages of development. In early stages, mainly involving Phase 1 IND studies, evaluations focus on the completeness of preclinical evidence supporting the use of anticancer drugs in humans and the safety of the drugs for initiation of clinical studies. Clinical protocols are evaluated for their appropriateness based on preclinical information, study eligibility criteria, treatment plans and modifications, and proposed monitoring plans for the safety of study subjects. Major safety endpoints of a study include assessment of the study agent’s tolerability and acute toxicity, dose-limiting toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, and determination of dosing schedules for further development.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Phase 2 studies are intended to evaluate antitumor activity of an agent in addition to gathering more safety information about the agent. In later stages of development, evaluations generally concentrate on the design and conduct of trials intended to support an NDA application. FDA evaluation will be provided to sponsors if they request end-of-phase 2 discussions of their development plans and/or special protocol assessments for protocols before the conduct of Phase 3 trials.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Substantial evidence of efficacy and safety must be demonstrated for an anticancer drug to receive FDA approval for an intended indication. The evidence must be based on adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that reliably provide quantitative assessments of measured clinical benefits and risks of study drugs [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4_35">4</CitationRef>]. To evaluate such evidence, the design of a trial will be considered in FDA review, which generally relates to the proposed study population, randomization and/or blinding, comparators, efficacy endpoints, and prespecified and/or interim analysis plans. Selection of appropriate endpoints and prespecification of analysis plan should be discussed with the Agency prior to initiating the trial.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The accepted regulatory anticancer endpoints can be classified into three types: prolongation of life (overall survival, OS), symptom relief or quality of life improvement (i.e., pain reduction or other patient-reported outcomes), and established surrogate(s) for a longer life or a better life [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5_35">5</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR9_35">9</CitationRef>]. Historically, anticancer drugs were approved based on the response rate alone until the mid-1980s, when the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC), a group of oncology experts that provide independent scientific advice based on reasoned application of oncologic science [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10_35">10</CitationRef>], recommended the use of an improvement in patient’s survival and symptoms for determining clinical benefit. In 1992, use of a surrogate endpoint that can reasonably likely predict clinical benefit was introduced under Subpart H for accelerated approval (AA) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4_35">4</CitationRef>] of new drugs for life-threatening diseases such as cancer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11_35">11</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR12_35">12</CitationRef>]. The drugs approved under AA require further studies to demonstrate clinical benefit. Moreover, established surrogates can also be used for regular approval of new anticancer drugs when they are considered to consistently predict clinical benefit in selected clinical settings [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7_35">7</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">To accelerate anticancer drug development, endpoints for different cancers have been discussed in the OODP-sponsored workshops held in collaboration with other stakeholders over the last 5 years. Some of the discussions have been subsequently presented to the ODAC meetings for cancer-specific regulatory advice. Acceptance of different surrogate endpoints varies with the types of cancer and/or the types of regulatory approval being considered. In prostate cancer, surrogates have not been established for their use in regulatory action (ODAC meeting in 2005 [<ExternalRef>
                <RefSource>http://www.fda.gov/oc/advisory</RefSource>
                <RefTarget Address="http://www.fda.gov/oc/advisory" TargetType="URL"/>
              </ExternalRef>]). Persuasive treatment effects of study drugs in evaluation for marketing approval must be based on prespecified statistical plans [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13_35">13</CitationRef>]. Post-hoc analyses and/or subgroup analyses do not scientifically support a claim, but rather justify initiating trials to verify the results of these analyses.</Para>

            <Section2 ID="Sec4">
              <Heading>Hormonal Agents</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The approved hormonal agents can be classified by their mechanisms of action into three groups: gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, GnRH antagonists, and androgen receptor (AR) antagonists. Leuprolide, a GnRH agonist, is the first hormonal agent that received FDA approval in 1985 for palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer, presenting an effective alternative for orchiectomy or use of estrogens [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1_35">1</CitationRef>]. Since then, different GnRH agonists and different formulations or delivery systems for longer drug action (up to 12 months) have also been approved. Use of these agonists has generally replaced orchiectomy or estrogen to achieve castration. However, GnRH agonists are associated with an initial testosterone surge before suppression. Contemplated by generating total androgen blockage, AR antagonists were developed and approved in the late 1980s and 1990s. Unlike a GnRH agonist, a GnRH antagonist does not cause the early testosterone flare, but can suppress testosterone as effectively as a GnRH agonist. The first GnRH antagonist, abarelix, was approved in 2003.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Efficacy endpoints for hormonal products are different for GnRH agents and AR antagonists. For the approval of GnRH products, either agonists or antagonists, serum testosterone was used as an established surrogate for castration. Survival was also used for the initial approval of goserelin in the metastatic disease setting. Avoidance of orchiectomy within 4–12 weeks of treatment was used for the approval of abarelix. AR antagonists were approved for use in conjunction with medical or surgical castration. None were approved as monotherapy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1_35">1</CitationRef>]. The approved hormonal products are summarized in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">35.1</InternalRef>. Details about the basis for their approvals can be found at drugs@FDA.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab1">

Patients with progressive prostate cancer who have received at least one hormonal therapy were included in the drug’s approval evaluation.

The efficacy endpoint in the trials was SREs, consisting of pathological fracture, radiation therapy to bone, surgery to bone, cord compression, and change in chemotherapy for bone pain (prostate cancer only). The efficacy endpoint was analyzed either as the proportion of patients with SRE or time to first SRE. In the prostate cancer study, efficacy analyses showed statistically significant reductions in skeletal morbidity in patients treated with the drug administered at 4 mg every 3–4 weeks for 12 months when compared with placebo-treated patients.</Para>

FDA approved this drug for metastatic and/or progressive carcinoma of the prostate in 1981 [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15_35">15</CitationRef>]. Prior to estramustine, diethylstilbestrol (DES) was the primary drug for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The approval of estramustine was based on the results of randomized studies comparing estramustine with DES in small-sized populations that included both orchiectomized and nonorchiectomized patients. The key efficacy evaluation relied on the differences in the rate of disease progression or in the rate of no disease progression between the estramustine and DES arms. These efficacy endpoints considered stable disease as a component of the calculation of response rate. Stable disease is not acceptable now as an adequate assessment of a treatment effect. Because of the historical differences and the evolution of clinical trial practices and regulatory standards in the last 20 years, discussing the studies and results that led to the approval of estramustine is less meaningful for today’s evaluation of prostate cancer drugs. The use of estramustine for prostate cancer appears to have been replaced by other agents.</Para>

This approval was based on the results of a randomized trial comparing mitoxantrone plus prednisone to prednisone alone in patients with symptomatic metastatic CRPC [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16_35">16</CitationRef>]. A total of 161 patients with tumor-related pain were randomized equally to each arm.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The primary endpoint was palliative response, defined as a two-point decrease in pain as assessed by a six-point pain scale completed by patients (or complete loss of pain if initially 1+) without an increase in analgesic medication and maintained for two consecutive evaluations at least 3 weeks apart, which was assessed based on McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). Palliative response rate was 29% in patients who received the combination compared with 12% in patients receiving prednisone alone <Emphasis Type="Italic">(P =</Emphasis>0.01). The duration of palliation was longer in patients receiving mitoxantrone (median 43 and 18 weeks; <Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>&lt; 0.0001, log-rank). Patients who were initially randomized to prednisone alone but had no response were allowed to receive mitoxantrone, and their response rate was 22%. Regarding the secondary endpoints, the key finding was that most responding patients had an improvement in quality-of-life scales and a decrease in serum prostate-specific antigen level. No difference in overall survival was found between the two arms. Nevertheless, the trial was not designed for detecting a survival difference. In addition, the drug safety profile was acceptable.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The endpoint for the mitoxantrone approval relied on the clinical benefit observed, although there was only a group (about 1/3) of patients who benefited from the combination treatment. More importantly, the approval helped change the previous views that prostate cancer was chemotherapy resistant. Furthermore, the pain control benefit was corroborated by the results of another similar but larger randomized trial of mitoxantrone in the same disease setting [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17_35">17</CitationRef>]. Despite the clinical benefit, the use of mitoxantrone in the patient population has diminished after the approval of docetaxel.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">The prespecified primary endpoint was overall survival.

In contrast, the weekly docetaxel arm did not show a statistically significant survival advantage over the control arm.

            <Heading>Challenges in Approval of Prostate Cancer Treatments</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Numerous agents for prostate cancer are currently under development. Some of them appear to be promising based on the evidence reported in recent oncology meetings. Like all other drugs, for a prostate cancer drug to receive regulatory approval, the results of adequate and well-conducted trials of the drug have to provide substantial evidence of efficacy and safety to assure effective clinical use in an intended population. In general, study drugs that have passed through the early phases of clinical development undergo intensive investigations for establishing their efficacy or clinical benefits. Nevertheless, their safety should always be a top concern during all phases of development. This could be exemplified by the recent termination of a Phase 3 trial of a study drug in combination with docetaxel in patients with CRPC because of a higher rate of sudden deaths in patients receiving the combination treatment [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22_35">22</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Therefore, the following discussions will focus on both endpoints acceptable for demonstrating efficacy for prostate cancer treatments and appropriate utilization of exploratory analyses in support of a new claim for the disease.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">As discussed earlier, the three types of endpoints, including prolongation of life, improvement in health-related quality of life, and established surrogate(s) likely for predicting either of them, are also applicable for evaluating efficacy of drugs/agents for prostate cancer. Clearly, overall survival and reliable patient-reported outcomes have been used for approving prostate cancer treatments. Several surrogate endpoints that are commonly used in early phase studies in prostate cancer, such as PSA response rate, prolongation of PSA doubling time, and time-to-tumor progression, have not been validated or accepted as evidence of efficacy for approving prostate cancer treatments.</Para>

The relative advantages and disadvantages of various surrogate endpoints such as PSA response, bone scan-based progression, time to disease progression, and progression-free-survival were discussed in the different disease settings. No consensus was reached about these surrogates because of insufficient evidence about their prediction of clinical benefit. This was further discussed and confirmed in the ODAC meeting in March 2005. Overall survival remains the standard endpoint in the Phase 3 metastatic setting to confirm clinical benefit. Recently, the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group has published its recommendations toward standardizing outcome measures, especially the surrogates, in evaluation of systemic treatment trials in patients with progressive CRPC, and encouraged incorporation of these recommendations into Phase 3 trials that assess overall survival to validate or refine the surrogates [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24_35">24</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Recent retrospective analyses of the PSA data from studies TAX327 and SWOG9916 showed a good survival correlation of PSA declines of 30% or more at the first 3 months, with a hazard ratio of 0.50 (<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis> &lt; 0.001) in TAX327 and a hazard ratio of 0.43 (<Emphasis Type="Italic">P</Emphasis>&lt; 0.001) in SWOG9916, respectively, when compared with those without the PSA declines [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25_35">25</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR26_35">26</CitationRef>]. These analyses suggest that a 30% PSA decline 3 months after treatment initiation may serve as a useful surrogate for predicting clinical benefit for cytotoxic agents. The validation of this surrogate in prospective studies is required before it can be used for future trial design and regulatory action. Prospective validation of this surrogate has been considered in two randomized trials that use overall survival as the primary endpoint for evaluating two different targeted agents in combination with docetaxel in patients with metastatic CRPC [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26_35">26</CitationRef>]. If positive, the results of these studies may help establish the first surrogate in this disease setting.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Use of nonvalidated surrogate endpoints for trials intended to support an NDA should be avoided. Combining various nonvalidated surrogates with validated endpoints in a composite endpoint (e.g., progression-free survival that includes the assessment of disease progression by PSA, bone scan, soft tissue, symptoms, or death) complicates the interpretation of the composite endpoint [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24_35">24</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR27_35">27</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">One common challenge is whether statistically underpowered analyses of secondary endpoints or results of post-hoc or subgroup analyses are acceptable as a basis for marketing approval when the primary endpoint of a trial is not satisfied as prespecified. These analyses should be viewed as exploratory or hypothesis-generating. These analyses cannot be viewed as definitive evidence of efficacy to support marketing approval of an intended indication. Statistically, no prespecified alpha level is generally reserved for conducting a formal analysis of the endpoints not prespecified in analysis plans. Thus, the “significant results” of such analyses may be produced by chance alone and do not necessarily signify true treatment differences [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28_35">28</CitationRef>].</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Selection of appropriate endpoints that measure the clinical benefit of a treatment effect is a cornerstone for efficacy evaluation of prostate cancer treatments. Selected trial endpoints and general trial designs should be discussed with the FDA prior to conduct of trials to accelerate drug development. Clinical benefits suggested by exploratory analyses such as subgroup or post-hoc analyses do not necessarily represent substantial evidence of efficacy to support marketing approval, but rather to justify initiating prospective controlled trials to verify the exploratory findings.</Para>

            <Heading>Summary</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">For the last two decades, the FDA has approved more than ten drugs for treatment of prostate cancer, which include hormonal, supportive, and cytotoxic agents. Although these drugs have remarkably improved the management of patients with the disease, evaluation of newer agents under development is highly challenging, especially for agents intended for patients with advanced metastatic disease resistant to castration and/or docetaxel. Although improvements in survival and/or patient-reported outcomes continue to be valid endpoints for approving new claims or agents, effective surrogates that can reliably predict clinical benefit remain to be established for the disease. In addition to adequate conduct of well-designed clinical trials, appropriate utilization of trial results is also very important. Subgroup analysis and/or post-hoc analysis results are not acceptable for regulatory action in general. Productive collaboration between all stakeholders and the agency is one of the keys for accelerating the development of prostate cancer treatments.</Para>
