              <Para>The eruption of Island volcano in April 2010 caused enormously big troubles for air transport over Europe for a long period of time. The losses and inconveniences for air companies, common business and usual passengers are difficult to be estimated but in any case are rather considerable. The insights from this extraordinary event are that serious efforts must be put in studding not only the volcanic events but in creating tools for reliable forecast of volcano products (mainly ash) distribution in case of eruption. There are few centers devoted to observation and forecast of such events. Some meteorological services lately created respective systems. The ENSEMBLE consortium leaded by European JRC in Ispra, Italy, which is aimed at elaborating ensemble forecast on the base of individual forecasts of almost all European Early Warning Systems (EWS) in case of nuclear accident decided to launch a series of exercises devoted to simulation of the first week air pollution dilution caused by Island volcano eruption. Bulgarian ERS (BERS) was upgraded as to be able to take part in these exercises and its results and comparisons with other model results are the object of this work.</Para>

              <Para>The severe atmospheric events like powerful volcano eruption do not cause serious problems for air quality at ground surface except for the neighboring territories. But sometimes they can cause serious economic problems. The disruption in ground transport caused by snow, floods etc. paled into insignificance compared with the havoc caused by the ash cloud spewed out by Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland. The event started on 14 April 2010. It lasted with different intensity more than a month. The eruption has been characterized by two main phases of intense ash emissions spanning April 14–21 and May 1–10.</Para>
              <Para>Volcanic eruptions are often referred to as violent explosions which spew huge rocks and hot lava. Some times volcanic eruptions can create very large clouds of ash that can be quite dangerous. When ash particles pass through the extremely hot jet engines, they melt into glass which coats any exposed areas. This can cause the engines to malfunction, including total engine failure. A detail description of these effects can be found in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR007412">12</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>Due to the damaging effect of ash particles to aircraft engines, during the Eyjafjallajokull eruption a lot of airports all over Europe have been closed sporadically for different periods of time. Even at open airport conditions many flights have been cancelled or delayed according to the volcanic ash distribution. The cancelled flights are estimated to more than 100,000. Millions of passengers were stranded not only because of the dust clouds, but due to the ultra-strict safety rules which banned flying if there was even a slightest trace of volcanic ash. The European Union’s executive body estimates the losses from the first 2 weeks of the disaster to 1.5–2.5 billion euros.</Para>
              <Para>It is obvious that such extremely harmful events, in spite very rare, do not get away from the monitoring and forecast practice of meteorological services and other devoted institutions. All around the world, nine Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs) are set, responsible for advising international aviation of the location and movement of clouds of volcanic ash. The Icelandic volcano was handled by the VAAC in London, England. Advisory charts have been issued several times per day during the entire event. Quite good description of London VAAC activity connected with Eyjafjallajokull eruption is presented in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR007411">11</CitationRef>]. Apart VAAC activities many other institutions had intensive activity, including modeling.</Para>
              <Para>The modeling activity performed in real or near-real time during the event suffers from different uncertainties. In [<CitationRef CitationID="CR007411">11</CitationRef>], special attention is paid on it. The main feature of the modeling activities is that only individual forecasts are issued. That is why the ENSEMBLE consortium (described in the next paragraph) decided to launch series of modeling exercises in attempt to obtain more realistic simulations of this event.</Para>

              <Heading>ENSEMBLE Project and Volcano Exercise</Heading>
              <Para>Ensemble modeling, originally developed for weather prediction, is lately being extended to atmospheric dispersion applications [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00741">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00742">2</CitationRef>]. Following this ideology the EU 5FP project ENSEMBLE was launched as a natural continuation and further development of ETEX project [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00743">3</CitationRef>] and of the follow-up RTMOD project [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00741">1</CitationRef>]. After its completing, the European Commission, recognizing the importance of the project achievements, converted its consortium to a permanent structure lead by JRC in Ispra, Italy. From that time many other institutions join the Consortium (see the ENCSEMBLE web-site [<CitationRef CitationID="CR007410">10</CitationRef>]). Now a day ENSEMBLE is a web-based decision support system that produces a comprehensive forecast based on the multi-model ensemble dispersion concept.

              <Para>ENSEMBLE Consortium launched a volcano exercise for the first week of the event (14–21 April 2010). The vertical structure was enlarged up 12,000 m.

              <Heading>BERS’ Simulation Results</Heading>
              <Para>Bulgarian Emergency Response System (BERS) in case of nuclear accident works operationally since 2001. Its creation and development was highly stimulated by the ETEX experiment. NIMH took part in all activities of ЕТЕХ with a puff-type dispersion model. Lately, the new 3D model EMAP was tested; performing better than the puff model and now it is the core of BERS. Description of the system and of EMAP is given in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00744">4</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00745">5</CitationRef>]. The EMAP model is verified many times in the frame of various projects as ETEX, RTMOD, ENSEMBLE and others.</Para>
              <Para>For ENSEMBLE applications EMAP is realized in a domain of 250 × 210 points with 20 km resolution covering the whole Europe on stereographic map projection. The vertical levels are 6 (up to 3,000 m). The participation of BERS in ENSEMBLE volcano exercise laid essential upgrades of EMAP and the whole system. First, the number of EMAP levels was increased and set as required by the exercise’s technical documents. As far as the operational met-data transferred from German Met Office (DWD) is quite limited, the high level data was downloaded from the free NCEP data base [<CitationRef CitationID="CR00749">9</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>BERS took part in all ENSEMBLE volcano exercise cases; results encrypted and uploaded to the ENSEMBLE web server. From all statistical parameters supported by ENSEMBLE system only “overlap in space” is used and respective images presented, here. It is done because of its quite illustrative character. This is the percentage of overlapping area to the common area of both comparable plumes. Here, only part of BERS results versus ensemble ones are presented. All images are produced by ENSEMBLE system. Many simulations were made by BERS in attempt to tune the EMAP model.</Para>
              <Para>The next two figures demonstrate the EMAP simulation abilities in comparison with an ensemble composed by the other ten models. In Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig00741">74.1</InternalRef>, the concentration spots of both simulations are shown for two particular moments. The percentage of overlap, as usual, decreases in time. Despite, EMAP plume coincides with ensemble one in big extent. <Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig00741">

              <Para>The Bulgarian Emergency Response System took part in the volcano exercise launched by ENSEMBLE consortium. The possibilities of the ENSEMBLE web-based system were used for tuning the BERS models. Despite all four cases of the exercise were calculated, BERS reliability was demonstrated only on Case 3. The main conclusion is that despite many unfavorable circumstances as different source of meteorological information for low and high layers, met-data set low time resolution, simplest numerical schemes etc., EMAP produces quite satisfactory results. All main features of volcanic ash distribution are caught by the model. The comparison of the levels of agreement of all models that took part in the exercise versus the ensemble of the remaining ten models shows that EMAP results are in the middle of the ranking. This entire means that NIMH with its BERS is a useful member of ENSEMBLE consortium.</Para>
