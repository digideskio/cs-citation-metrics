              <Para>In recent years a continuously increasing demand for the application of continuous casting in the production of medium and high-alloyed steel grades in large formats (called jumbo blooms) has been noticed. Whereas in the past the production of these grades was mainly the domain of ingot casting and remelting processes, continuous casting of such formats was considered rather a niche market and has only very recently been introduced on a larger scale. The present contribution should highlight the different challenges attributed to the production of large rounds. Furthermore, the production feasibility by means of semi-continuous casting process will be explained.</Para>

              <Heading>Zusammenfassung</Heading>
              <Para>In den letzten Jahren zeigten Marktanfragen für die Errichtung neuer Gießanlagen einen stetig steigenden Trend zur Erzeugung (d.h. dem Vergießen) großformatiger Vorblöcke (sogenannter Jumbo Blooms) für mittel- bis hochlegierte Stähle. Schwere Blöcke wurden in der Vergangenheit nahezu ausschließlich mittels konventionellem Blockguss bzw. über Umschmelzverfahren erzeugt. Erst kürzlich wurden Stranggießanlagen für Blöcke mit Formaten &gt; 700 mm rd errichtet. Der vorliegende Beitrag zeigt die grundsätzlichen Herausforderungen bei der Erzeugung großformartiger Blöcke mit kontinuierlichen Gießverfahren auf. Darüberhinaus wird die Machbarkeit eines neuen semi-kontinuierlichen Gießverfahrens untersucht und das Verfahren erläutert.</Para>

              <Para>In the last decade, a rising demand for the production of large-format semis (above 600 mm equivalent circle diameter) could be observed in the steel industry. With ever-growing dimensions of final products such as large-scale rotor shafts, bearing rings, or similar applications, steel producers strive to produce larger scale semis at reasonable costs and with reasonable effort. Furthermore, a trend towards an increased production of medium- and high-alloyed grades in different medium-size formats can be seen.</Para>
              <Para>Broadly speaking, the following processes are available on an industrial scale:</Para>

              <Para>It is evident that the final choice of the correct process is influenced by a great variety of selection criteria that very often depend on the existing plant infrastructure and production possibilities. For all practical purposes, however, it can be said that the production of large rounds via continuous casting usually implies a capital-intensive casting machine—yet, with high productivity and quite low operating costs. On the other hand, production via ingot casting requires only low initial investment but involves higher operational costs and provides a substantially lower yield.</Para>
              <Para>With the aim of establishing an alternative production process which combines certain advantages of continuous casting with those of ingot casting, a semi-continuous casting process called Segment Casting (SC) is currently being developed.</Para>
              <Para>Generally speaking, SC is a semi-continuous vertical casting process which is currently used only in some niche applications for the production of special steel grades. In the non-ferrous industry, however, this process is quite common. Yet, due to the more adverse solidification conditions of steels, the application in the production of quality steels requires addressing certain challenges given by solidification physics.</Para>
              <Para>The aim of this paper is to introduce the overall process concept of SC and to derive specific design criteria which are crucial for the successful establishment of a new casting technique. In the following, these design criteria are discussed and finally light is shed on the current development stage of an ongoing research project by providing specific examples.</Para>

                <Heading>Casting Phase</Heading>
                <Para>The casting phase starts with the insertion of the dummy bar head into the machine. The dummy bar acts as a withdrawal device of the solidified strand from the mould. After some preparatory work (sealing of the dummy bar head in the mould), the actual casting process can be started upon the opening of a ladle. The steel then flows into the tundish through a protective refractory shroud in order to prevent re-oxidation. The tundish, a refractory-lined steel vessel, distributes the steel to the strands and buffers the steel level. The steel stream that flows between the tundish and the mould will also be protected by a submerged entry nozzle.</Para>
                <Para>Casting is started by using the starter bar, which rests on a mechanically actuated base plate support. This system supports the cast strand while growing and withdrawing until casting of a bloom with a length between 7–13 m is completed.</Para>
                <Para>During withdrawal of the strand, the mould is oscillated by a mould oscillator.</Para>
                <Para>During casting, the strand will partially be cooled along the secondary cooling zone and thereafter cooled down only by heat radiation. An electromagnetic stirrer is used to promote the transition from columnar to equiaxed transition similar to standard continuous casting procedures.</Para>
                <Para>It is important to mention that the complete casting of the strand is performed in a fully vertical manner. After the extracting/casting of the strand up to its full length, the solidification phase starts.</Para>

                <Heading>Solidification Phase</Heading>
                <Para>During the solidification phase, the strand is not moved any further. The focus is now on the full solidification of the extracted strand. During this phase, metallurgical work has to be performed on the solidifying strand in order to achieve beneficial metallurgical effects. Thus, the formation of cavities, pores, and segregation patterns can be limited.</Para>
                <Para>Additionally, a hot feeding operation has to be carried out to avoid the formation of shrinkage piping, consequently achieving a higher yield. The hot feeding needs to be performed during the whole solidification phase and will substantially decrease the formation of cavities and avoid long and undesired piping in the large blooms thus increasing the yield of the process.</Para>
                <Para>Once the cast strand has completely solidified, it will be extracted from the machine by adequate devices.</Para>

                <Heading>Piping</Heading>
                <Para>The main problem in batch or single casting of large size blooms is the long and undesired piping in the large diameter bloom, which results in low yield of the process.</Para>
                <Para>Piping occurs in large moulds of any kind by considerable volume decrease of the steel during solidification due to well-known underlying physical principles and occurs in zones, where the steel solidifies last, which is in the hot top; underneath the piping there is often a porous structure, the so called micro-piping. In most cases these hollow areas cannot be filled due to a shortage of liquid steel.</Para>
                <Para>The most effective measure to avoid piping is to keep the steel liquid in a hot top of suitable design for as long as possible. Furthermore, it is necessary to cast the upper part of the strand with decreased speed and to refill the strand top with liquid steel to fill the spaces caused by shrinkage.</Para>
                <Para>The above investigation of piping phenomena clearly shows that a suitable process for providing sufficient liquid steel even during solidification is required. Fundamental investigations on this issue are also provided in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Heading>Bridge Formation and Pronounced Directional Solidification</Heading>
                <Para>Apart from piping during final solidification, bridge formation is another well-known effect that can occur during continuous casting (or also ingot casting), which is well described in the literature, e.g. in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>Moreover, after solidification of this small encapsulated area, the shrinkage during solidification results in the formation of local micro-cavities which cannot be filled by liquid steel any more.</Para>
                <Para>Evidently, these phenomena have a detrimental effect on the final product quality and should be avoided in all circumstances. For this reason the application of an electromagnetic stirrer is typically very efficient in decreasing the likeliness of bridge formation during solidification. Moreover, especially with regard to casting of large ingots, the local solidification conditions (low undercooling, shallow temperature gradient) promote the occurrence of bridge formation even more significantly. Therefore, the application of the electromagnetic stirrer is an absolute must for a segment caster to stir the melt and thus avoid local excessive growth of dendrites.</Para>

              <Para>The following conclusions can be drawn from this evaluation. While, at the end of the casting phase, the strand still shows an undesired long liquid pool (nearly down to the bottom), it is interesting to note that already large parts of the strand are semi-liquid with a major volume already below liquidus temperature. Despite this fact the total solidification time for such a bloom still amounts to &gt; 4 h solidification time.</Para>

A Niyama value below this critical value leads to the occurrence of shrinkage porosity. The advantage of this criterion is its independence of the casting geometry. Details of the criterion and its application to the evaluation of shrinkage porosities are provided in [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>].</Para>

It becomes clear that major parts of the cast product would suffer from severe inner quality problems, since the Niyama value is below the above stated critical threshold.</Para>
                <Para>In order to overcome these quality problems, recent research activities have focused on the establishment of the correct process parameters of the applied technological measures (electromagnetic stirring, hot topping) and their verification by the simulation tools outlined above. The research results show that, if certain technological measures are taken, the Niyama criterion can be increased considerably:</Para>

              <Para>Segment Casting, a novel approach for the production of jumbo bloom formats, has been developed and described. In this paper, the process of Segment Casting itself along with the main technological and metallurgical design challenges has been discussed and highlighted.</Para>
              <Para>In line with an ongoing research project, the process development itself is performed by means of the FEM software ProCAST. Typical simulation results have been presented in the paper. Finally, possible metallurgical improvements and their quantitative evaluation by means of well-established comparison measures (Niyama criterion) have been demonstrated. The results prove that special technological measures need to be taken in order to ensure the best product quality.</Para>
