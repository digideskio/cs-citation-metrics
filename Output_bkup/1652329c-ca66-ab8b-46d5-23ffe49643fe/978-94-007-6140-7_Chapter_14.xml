              <Para TextBreak="No">This analysis assesses the spatial distribution of 2006 crime within San Antonio, Texas, as a function of alcohol retail outlet density and population density, while controlling for the effects of spatially auto-correlated error. The purpose of this analysis is threefold. First, the nature of association between the variables of interest is significant in its own right, as a way to explore its academic and socio-political implications. Second, the amount of existing research on the subject allows for an invaluable opportunity to substantiate current findings. Ultimately, however, the goal of this analysis is to gauge the benefits of using statistical methods that account for the effects of spatial auto-correlation in the analysis of variables prone to spatial auto-correlation-induced error. The authors purport that this methodological approach to a previously-explored problem represents a unique and significant contribution to the existing research on the association between alcohol retail outlet density and population density.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Specifically, while the existing literature supports a consistent association between the variables of interest, the methodological limitations of existing studies have resulted in contradictory findings when specific questions have been posed. The findings of the present analysis support the conjecture that many of these inconsistencies are the result of the limitations inherent in the measurement of the variables used and the methods employed, which fail to correct for the effects of spatially-autocorrelated induced error.</Para>
            </Section1>
            <Section1 ID="Sec2" Type="Introduction">
              <Heading>Background</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The ability to gauge the effects of alcohol retail outlet density on crime appears to be dependent on the use of appropriately sized geographic areas of analysis. Specifically, while areas that are too small are difficult to measure and may fail to properly account for variation across an area, the use of very large areas as the geographic unit of analysis allows for little control and assessment of many of the socio-economic variables of interest, also resulting in a failure to detect variation across an area.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">There is strong evidence of association between some types of crime and the density of alcohol retail outlets within the extant literature, particularly within small areas of geography (Scribner et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">1999</CitationRef>). Gorman and associates (<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2001</CitationRef>) found an increased incidence of violent crime in census tracts with higher alcohol outlet density. Their report speaks to the need for assessments of small areas of geography, given the limited spatial impact on crime afforded by the density of alcohol retail outlets. More recently Gorman and others (<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2005</CitationRef>) found significant increases in their analytical model attributable to two alcohol outlet density measures and several socio-structural variables, as well as a lack of spatially lagged effects.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Similarly, Gyimah-Brempong (<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">2001</CitationRef>) cites the inability of analysts to control for potential environmental variables that can have an unequal impact on crime across a large area. Scribner and associates (<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2008</CitationRef>) cite similar problems as affecting the variance partition across levels of analysis in their multi-level examination of outlet density and college drinking. An earlier study of 223 municipalities in New Jersey found that the density of alcohol outlets was not a significant contributor to the variance in crime rates for those areas (Gorman et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">1998</CitationRef>). However, one longitudinal study of 256 American cities did find a significant relationship between alcohol outlet density and homicide (Gruenewald et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">1993</CitationRef>). The contradictory nature of some of these findings led us to re-examine the relation between alcohol outlet density and crime.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The relationship between alcohol outlet density and crime appears to vary by the manner in which alcohol is distributed to its consumers, specifically, whether outlets sell alcohol for on-site, off-site, or both on- and off-site consumption, and whether the density of total alcohol outlets is taken into consideration. In an analysis of alcohol availability and homicide on college campuses, Scribner and associates (<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2008</CitationRef>) concluded that the relationship holds true even when considering both on and off-site consumption sales. In 2005, Gorman and his colleagues cited the differential impact of alcohol outlet density on crime as a factor of whether outlets that sold alcohol for on-site consumption were included in the model, among other variables (Gorman et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2005</CitationRef>). A more recent analysis by Gruenewald and others (<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2006</CitationRef>) found assault rates significantly associated with outlets that sold alcohol intended for off-site consumption, however the relationship did not hold for bars. In contrast, a longitudinal analysis conducted in Norway found a significant, positive association between the number of alcohol outlets that provide for on-site consumption of alcohol and violent crime (Norstrom <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">2000</CitationRef>). In an analysis of census tracts within two Texas cities, total alcohol outlet density significantly affected crime while variables consisting of off-site, on-site and both on-and-off-site consumption did no (Zhu et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">2004</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The inconsistency of these findings caused us to question if the methods used were responsible for at least some of the differences in findings previously identified in the literature. Specifically, failure to control for the manner in which alcohol is distributed across an area will result in inconsistent findings, to the extent that the nature of alcohol distribution varies across these geographic areas.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The potential associations between population density and crime rates for the purposes of this analysis are twofold. First, areas with denser populations naturally have more potential consumers of alcohol, and subsequently, have an increased likelihood of having higher levels of overall alcoholic consumption. Lipton and Gruenewald (<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2002</CitationRef>) found that the positive association between alcohol outlet density and crime had its greatest effect in densely populated areas. Second, the importance of population density as a significant (and sole) contributor to crime in the analysis of alcohol consumption has been noted in the literature (Gruenewald et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2006</CitationRef>), particularly because of its strong link to socioeconomic contextual variables such as poverty and education.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Although traditional socio-economic variables, i.e., age, race/ethnicity/income, have been used as predictive factors for the relationship between alcohol availability and crime (Gorman et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">2001</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">2005</CitationRef>; Lipton and Gruenewald <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">2002</CitationRef>), precedent mandates this analysis be conducted at a small level of geographic analysis in order to avoid the above-stated limitations surrounding the use of large geographic areas as units of analysis. Given the age of the most recent figures available at the census tract level for the city of San Antonio, namely those from the 2000 U.S. Census, analyses employing demographic variables as independent factors will be limited to the use of population density. Scribner and associates (<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">1999</CitationRef>) took a similar approach in ascertaining the strong geographic relationships between homicide rates and two different measures of alcohol outlet density, to the complete exclusion of socio-­demographic factors. It is worth noting that this analysis was also conducted at the end of an inter-censual period.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">As such, given the potential problems associated with using traditional socio-­economic variables in this type of analysis, the established relation between population density and these types of variables, and ultimately, the aim of this analysis to reconcile many of the inconsistencies found in many of the aforementioned studies, the use of population density as the sole predictor variable was deemed preferable as a way to obtain well-grounded and consistent results across our analysis – at the expense of potentially more descriptive findings.</Para>

              <Heading>Purpose and Hypotheses</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">We will first document the extent to which crime rates, alcohol retail outlets, and population density exhibit positive autocorrelation (are clustered) throughout San Antonio. The existence of positive autocorrelation is indicative of the effects that variable values in surrounding areas have on neighboring areas.</Para>
              <FormalPara RenderingStyle="Style2">
                <Heading>Hypothesis 1:</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Given the relations previously identified in the extant literature, we hypothesize that crime rates, alcohol outlet density, and population density will exhibit significant levels of positive autocorrelation, manifested by clustering within each of the variables.</Para>
              </FormalPara>
              <FormalPara RenderingStyle="Style2">
                <Heading>Hypothesis 2:</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">As further evidence of autocorrelation within variables, variable associations identified through the use of statistical methods that account and correct for autocorrelation-­induced error in the analysis of local variance will be greatest when the variables included are highly auto-correlated.</Para>
              </FormalPara>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Second, we will determine if correcting for spatially autocorrelated-induced error will result in overall improvement in model fit, when compared to testing the same models using standard Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression methods.</Para>
              <FormalPara RenderingStyle="Style2">
                <Heading>Hypothesis 3:</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A model accounting for spatial autocorrelation will be characterized by an increase in fit when compared with the traditional Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Model.</Para>

              <Heading>Methods</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The dependent variable <Emphasis Type="Italic">crime density</Emphasis> is divided into three categories. The first two are exclusive, (1) violent crime density, and (2) non-violent crime density, while the aggregated category of (3) total crime density encompasses both violent and non-­violent crime. The need to distinguish between violent and non-violent crimes, in addition to the consideration of total crime is essential because they differ in their nature, i.e., crimes against the individual, as opposed to crimes against property, respectively, and each has been found to have different causes and determents.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">We assess the association between alcohol retail outlet density and crime across four types of alcohol retail establishments, based on the point of consumption of their clientele: (1) density of establishments that sell alcohol for on-site consumption only, such as restaurants, bars, and clubs; (2) density of establishments that sell alcohol for off-site consumption only, such as liquor wholesale and retail outlets, drive thru and pick-ups, and carry-outs, (3) density of outlets that sell alcohol for both on-site and off-site consumption, and (4) total outlets, the aggregate sum of on-site, off-site, and outlets that sell alcohol for both on-site and off-site consumption. These gradients are necessary given their relationship to alcohol availability in an area, as well as to build upon previous research.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec5">
                <Heading>Population Density Estimates</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In order to obtain a valid estimate of population density at the subcounty level for 2006, valid estimates of population size were needed. It was determined that the most appropriate method of estimation was the apportionment method, given its low associated data requirements, and its feasibility. Because the estimation method requires comparable, subcounty population size values across censuses (1990 and 2000), it required the creation of a common set of geographic units from which to ascertain the size and distribution of inter-censual population change.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The 1990 and 2000 Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) System shapefiles containing the outlines of Bexar County, San Antonio, and their associated census tracts were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau. The U.S. Census Tract Relationship Files were then used to determine areas of change between the two censuses at the census tract level.

Values for the population size and area of the original census tracts were then obtained from the Texas State Data Center (<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2008</CitationRef>) and were aggregated in the same manner to produce a modified set of 177 subcounty areas useful for comparative analysis across the 1990 and 2000 U.S. censuses.</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">While the crime data used in this analysis provides information for the incidence of crime throughout the City of San Antonio, the Population Density and Alcohol Outlet Density variables were ascertained for the entire county of Bexar. As such, using the rationale proposed in Mitchell (<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">2005</CitationRef>) only the subcounty areas whose centroids are located within the San Antonio city limits were selected for final analysis, reducing the number of geographic units available for analysis to 146 subcounty areas. These 146 subcounty areas represent those that fall completely within or mostly within the city limits of San Antonio. Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">14.1</InternalRef> below shows the ­relationship between these three areas (county, city, and area of analysis). The subcounty areas in the darker shading represent the 146 selected for analysis.

The listing contained the necessary “permit type” information to classify the information as follows: Those allowing for the consumption of alcohol on-site, off-site, and both on- and off-site, as well as allowing for their summation as the total number of permits. Since the obtained permit list was for active permits as of April 9, 2008, all permits that had an issue date after December 31, 2006 were excluded (455) from analysis, as were permit types that did not fit into the four consumption categories detailed above (169). Also excluded from analysis were those permits that had been active sometime in 2006, but expired prior to the retrieval of the permit list obtained for this analysis. Other analyses use similar exclusions and data sources (see Gruenewald et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2006</CitationRef>; Scribner et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2008</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Para TextBreak="No">Spatial joins using ArcGIS software were then performed to determine the number of alcohol retail outlets within each subcounty area. Densities of alcohol retail outlets (both total and by type) were ascertained by dividing the number of outlets by the total population within each subcounty area. The figure was multiplied by 10,000 to allow for the inclusion of areas with a minimal number of alcohol outlets, and to provide a figure comparable across analyses. All permits outside the boundaries of the 146 subcounty areas deemed useful for analysis were removed from the final sample, yielding frequencies of 1,824 total outlets that sold alcohol within the areas, 781 outlets that sold alcohol for strictly off-site consumption, 473 outlets that sold alcohol for strictly on-site consumption, and 570 outlets that sold alcohol for both on- and off-site consumption.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">Preliminary univariate exploration of the variables to be modeled provides some insight into their individual characteristics, as well as their degree of spatial autocorrelation (clustering). Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">14.1</InternalRef> provides basic univariate statistics and the Raw Moran’s I coefficient for each variable in this analysis. The Raw Moran’s I coefficient provides a measure of the extent to which the data for one area tend to resemble data from adjacent areas for the same variable. Put simply, it answers the question: “To what extent can similar values of a variable be expected to be found together geographically?”

              <Para TextBreak="No">While population density appears to have little impact on neighboring crime densities, the density of alcohol retail outlets appears to play a more significant role. Once again, the impact of spatially lagged autocorrelation appears strongest on violent crime, although most of the associations between outlet densities and neighboring crime show some level of statistically significant autocorrelation, as indicated by the corresponding Moran’s I and p values. Consideration of total outlet density when assessing the effects of spatially lagged values on crime appears to provide the most consistently significant findings across the types of crime examined.</Para>

OLS analyses were conducted using R statistical software. Given the goals of this analysis, the independent variables were regressed against each of the three crime dimensions outlined above. As is evident from Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab3">14.3</InternalRef> above, the outlet variables alone account for 56 of the variance in the violent crime variable, almost 46 of the variance in the total crime variable, and 37 of the variance in the non-­violent variable.

              <Para TextBreak="No">Moreover, while Model 1 appears to contribute a significant amount of variation across the crime variables, relatively little of this contribution is due to the influence of population density on violent crime (R<Superscript>2</Superscript> = .0017). As such, the global impact of population density appears to be negligible in regards to its impact on violent crime, assessed at the local level when no adjustment for spatial autocorrelation is made – pointing to a non-overlapping relationship between the population density and crime density clusters. This finding is partially consistent with the Multivariate Moran’s I analysis in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">14.2</InternalRef>, where the neighboring population density values were found to have the least impact on values for the dependent variables.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In order to compare the effects of adjusting for spatial autocorrelation in regression analyses against the earlier OLS findings, R statistical software was used to conduct a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) of the crime variables being analyzed. Determination of improvement to model fit was gauged using two methods proposed by Leung et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2000</CitationRef>), in which goodness of fit is determined by gauging the significance in the difference for the residual sum of squares and variance, between the OLS (F1 below) and GWR (F2 below) models.

              <Para TextBreak="No">Of all types of crime, violent crime density appears to have most-consistently benefited from GWR analyses, as is evident in the corresponding p values, the large F2 statistics, and the small F1 statistics. This finding supports earlier analyses where the violent crime density variable exhibited relatively high levels of autocorrelation (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">14.1</InternalRef>). Specifically, higher levels of autocorrelation between and among the variables would provide for more significant potential for improvement from the GWR. It is also important to note that total crime density saw improvements in model fit, as gauged by the F2 statistic, in both Models 1 and 2, despite the previous lack of significance associated with population density in the OLS models for violent crime. The phenomenon provides additional support for the spatial nature of the auto-correlation inherent in the population density variable independently, as well as in its relation to other variables of interest, particularly among violent crime.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">In contrast, non-violent crime density saw the strongest improvement in Model 2, which included population density as its sole predictor variable, contradictory improvements across the two models that included population density as a predictor, and a consistent lack of improvement in Model 3, which excluded population density as a predictor variable. Such a pattern points to a potentially different relation between population density and different types of crime.</Para>

              <Para TextBreak="No">First, examination of the Raw Moran’s I scores identifies the population density, on-site alcohol outlet density, and violent crime density variables as having the highest level of autocorrelation, while the findings in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">14.2</InternalRef> point to the spatially lagged effects of neighboring outlet densities on violent crime.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Second, although clusters of areas with similar population densities are evident, they do not appear to be consistently related to clusters of specific outlet types or crime when accounting for spatial autocorrelation. As such, even though the interaction between high population density and easy access to immediate consumption of alcohol does carry with it the potential for an increased density of crime within an area, further analysis is needed to understand the interaction between population density and crime clusters.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Third, as evident in the OLS regression models, population density actually does little to contribute to the variance accounted for within the models predicting violent crime, while the outlet variables alone account for 56 of the variance in the violent crime variable, almost 46 of the variance in the total crime variable, and 37 % of the variance in the non-violent variable. Given the potential contribution of population density to alcohol availability (described above), further exploration of the demographic composition (i.e., age distribution) of these areas would be helpful in ascertaining this apparently contradictory relationship.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Fourth, consistent association between outlet density and total crime is of particular relevance because it emphasizes the need to differentiate across different points of consumption in order to gain a clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms inherent within this general relationship. For example, violent crime is most strongly associated with the immediate availability of alcohol (reduced time and travel costs). As such, it would also be worth examining whether this relationship holds true among different types of violent crime. The clustering of alcohol outlet types within each of the individual points of consumption also points to the perpetuation of certain types of outlets in certain areas, and provides further support for differentiating across different points of consumption.</Para>
