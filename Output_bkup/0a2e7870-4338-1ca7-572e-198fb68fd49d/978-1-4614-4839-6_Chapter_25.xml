              <Para TextBreak="No">In spite of such statistics, higher education institutions are rarely considered when talking about occupational health and wellness issues. The present chapter is being written to fill this void.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">At the outset, it should also be noted that many of the issues to be discussed in the present chapter will have been reviewed in greater detail in other chapters of this handbook because of its occupational theme. For example, the chapter by Dewe, O’Driscoll and Cooper explores the relationship between work-related strain and well-being, and these authors presented a <Emphasis Type="Italic">Job Demand-Control-Support</Emphasis>,which emphasized the importance of high job demands and a low degree of control in ­producing high job strain. In another chapter, Theorell further elucidated the physiological/health consequences of high- versus low-strain jobs on workers. In addition, McGeary’s and McGeary’s chapter on <Emphasis Type="Italic">Occupational Burnout</Emphasis> explored the role of job demands, weighed against perceived job resources, in explaining the complex relationship between job burnout and work engagement, ­regardless of the occupation being examined. As will be seen in this chapter, many of these same dynamics can play out in one specific job that will be reviewed, that of a community college academic administrator.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">There is a wide diversity of organizations, with unique models of management, hierarchical levels of responsibility and power, and styles of leadership. Colleges and universities are such unique organizations with their own structure, organization and levels of responsibility. Successful colleges and universities manage their budgets and fiscal resources by balancing the costs of education, subsidized support from the government or private sector, and the tuition costs paid for by students. State-funded colleges and universities are dependent on each state’s annual budget and, as states have experienced, their own fiscal crises over the last 5 years. Higher education has also been struggling with the price of education in comparison to the efficiency of successfully educating the student of today.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A common thought and/or expectation is that college and university administrators are simply strong and long-standing faculty members who choose to move into the administrative sector of their institution. Although this style of promoting from within has been common in the past, it is no longer the most useful paradigm. One of the biggest differences between the faculty perspective and the administrator perspective is the job related focus (Foster, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00259">2006</CitationRef>). The faculty role is considered to be program focused with great emphasis on strengthening the course offerings, the faculty members, recruitment and graduation rates of students, and meeting yearly budgetary expectations. In contrast, an administrator’s role is considered to be institutional focused with emphasis on managing departments collectively, advocating for the needs of their departments and incorporating both of these components into strategic planning efforts geared toward the yearly goals of the overall institution. To be successful at transitioning from a faculty role to an administrative role, one must move from a specialist to a generalist and place to the side a discipline-specific focus or bias, and take on a broader multidiscipline view (Plater, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002537">2006</CitationRef>). Understanding the distinctions in these two viewpoints is critical in considering: (a) why not all faculty can be administrators; (b) why a transition from faculty to administration is noted to be difficult; (c) why the workload dramatically increases when one moves into administration; and (d) why many new administrators choose to return to faculty positions quickly or have difficulty understanding and mastering these new skill sets.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">When exploring an organization’s strength and fiscal health, it is quite common to look at the length of tenure of the top-tier administrators; the world of higher education is no different. In most colleges and universities, the President is the top-level position, followed by Vice Presidents, Provosts, Deans, Assistant and/or Associate Deans, and then the Department Chairs. Each role has designated job descriptions varying in levels of responsibility, from Deans overseeing multiple clusters of departments, to Department Chairs managing and overseeing their own faculty, staff, and students. The Vice Presidents and President oversee varying levels of responsibility of the college and/or university. Participants and members of the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) created a model of six primary competencies for current and future Community College Leaders (American Association of Community Colleges, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00252">2005</CitationRef>, p. 1). These six competencies are listed in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00251">25.1</InternalRef>.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00251">

              <Para TextBreak="No">The administrative roles investigated in the literature have ranged from the Presidents, the Vice Presidents, Deans, and Department Chairs, along with a variety of other similar titles. What appears clear is that strong and well-functioning institutions of higher education have continuity and consistency in their top leadership positions. However, increasing concern is mounting related to a severe shortage of community college leaders in the very near future. This trend appears to be due to a decrease in the number of advanced degrees now being awarded in community college leadership, complexities and increased workloads noted at the academic leadership level, and numerous barriers to advancement including the dissolution of preparatory administrative positions during state fiscal crises (Keim &amp; Murray, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002517">2008</CitationRef>; McNair, Duree, &amp; Ebbers, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002527">2011</CitationRef>). Reille and Kezar (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002540">2010</CitationRef>) suggest that at least 1,500 top community college personnel (e.g., Presidents and Chief Academic Officers) either have or will be retiring by the end of 2012. However, vacancies are also becoming apparent at all levels of academic administration, and as those in the lower ranks are promoted or hired for higher position, their vacated positions are not being readily filled. Steady turnover at these higher positions is not only costly, due to the price of recruitment, interviewing, and acclimating a new administrator into their new role, but also often creates a wave of other changes. Additional vacancies may occur, conflicts may arise, and a period of unsettling and unrest is not uncommon. Knowing that these sorts of responses are possible, administrators, and researchers have searched for ways to understand and ultimately increase longevity in these critical academic management positions.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Filan and Seagren (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00258">2003</CitationRef>) delineated six-specific leadership characteristics that they found to be critical for success at the midlevel management level in higher education. The Academy of Leadership Training and Development was created in 1992 in Mesa, Arizona to offer internationally recognized leadership training for department chairs and assistant/associate deans to evolve within their new or current positions. The six critical focus areas for academic middle managers are (a) understanding one’s self—strengths and limitations; (b) understanding transformational leadership—encouraging others to grow and develop; (c) establishing and maintaining relationships—effective and positive rapport with all levels; (d) leading teams—striving for high performance and balanced successful teamwork; (e) leading strategic planning and change—aids the focus, direction, and quality of the institution every year; and (f) connecting through community—bringing all players within the college or university to the community for mutual gain (Filan &amp; Seagren, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00258">2003</CitationRef>).</Para>

              <Heading>Review of Major Organizational Management Concepts</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A host of variables have been studied over the last 20 years with respect to varying administrative positions within colleges and/or universities. Job satisfaction, intention to leave, stress, workload concerns, and social support are but a few of the work-related variables examined. Inevitably, if these specific work-related concepts are not managed well, the process of job burnout can ensue. To explore how these concepts interrelate in an academic administrative setting, understanding the phenomena and evolution of job burnout is critical.</Para>

                <Heading>Job Burnout</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The general area of occupational burnout has been more comprehensively reviewed in another ­chapter of this handbook, by McGeary and McGeary. The concept of burnout became part of ­psychosocial and human services research in the 1970s. Maslach (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002523">1976</CitationRef>) is most noted for her dedication to researching the phenomenon of burnout in the workplace, and creating the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Maslach Burnout Inventory Tool</Emphasis> (Maslach &amp; Jackson, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002524">1981</CitationRef>). What has evolved over the last 30 years is a concise portrait of burnout that involves three key aspects: (a) overwhelming exhaustion which is related to amount and severity of stress; (b) feelings of doubt, mistrust and/or detachment from their work position most representative of an interpersonal nature; and (c) a growing sense of ineffectiveness and not accomplishing or completing tasks related to a personal view of not achieving a set level of performance (Maslach, Schaufeli, &amp; Leiter, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002526">2001</CitationRef>). As research into burnout has progressed, there appear to be individual factors unique to those who experience burnout, such as individual factors like age, marital status, and educational level. Personality characteristics, such as low hardiness (which will be addressed later in this chapter), lower level self-esteem and/or an avoidant means of coping with conflict appear to show greater signs of burnout in the work environment. Lastly, an individual’s personal job attitudes or expectations may predict burnout levels. If personal expectations are extremely high or even unrealistic, burnout can ensure. Most recently, Maslach and Leiter (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002525">1997</CitationRef>) began addressing the proper match between an employees’ personality and qualities of their job position. Six concepts appear to be critical variables in understanding the relationship between an occupation or position, and whether a person finds work dimensions acceptable or not. These concepts are explored in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00252">25.2</InternalRef>.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00252">

                <Heading>Job Satisfaction</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Another major area of research of renewed concern is job satisfaction measures of academic administrators as well as of faculty. One of the foremost early researchers on job satisfaction is Locke (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002522">1969</CitationRef>) who defined job satisfaction as a “…pleasurable emotional state resulting from the appraisal of one’s job as achieving or facilitating the achievement of one’s job values” (p. 316). It stands to reason that if someone is happy in their job, they will remain and, if they are not, they will at some point leave that position. Because expanding and enhancing academic administrators’ tenure in leadership positions is critical for continuity (for a highly positive and well-functioning administrative team and for the public view of a community college’s importance to a community) it therefore becomes essential to try to enhance job satisfaction. Indeed, job satisfaction continues to be a critical variable in studies across administrators, department chairs, and faculty. All of these college employees may impact a student’s collegial satisfaction which has fiscal and publicity-related implications.</Para>

                <Heading>Other Concepts to Consider</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Trends of decreasing length of times in these key academic administrative positions have been reported. Turnover at this level can be quite expensive, with cost estimates ranging from 5- to 25 times of an employee’s monthly salary (Glick, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002512">1992</CitationRef>). It is also documented that efforts to offset turnover are underutilized. However, with fiscal crises affecting multiple state budgets, higher workloads are contributing to increased levels of stress at the Assistant and/or Associate Dean, Program Director and Department Chair levels. Stress can be caused by numerous factors that include role ambiguity and lack of social support. Understanding all aspects of the role one is undertaking is critical to job satisfaction and managing stress. Yet, as budget cuts occur, community colleges have been faced with trimming their administrative tier of positions, and then consolidating the positions that remained. Role ambiguity relates to a lack of complete confidence as to what the role is, as well as new levels of authority and amount of responsibility. When a job position is expanded or altered, this can have a negative effect on the administrator, as well as the staff and faculty involved. The ramifications of a job position change, including changes in stress level and workload, can be felt by subordinates. That administrator may no longer be as available for consultation, may not be as invested, and may not be able to engage in supportive exchanges with subordinates. Removing some of the “perks” from the prior position and replacing them with higher labor-intensive or cognitive expectations can diminish one’s prior positive job satisfaction, as well as affect the satisfaction of those in the same department. As is noted in the chapter by McGeary and McGeary in this present handbook, this can be a precursor to the development of job burnout.</Para>

              <Heading>Research Looking at Academic Administrators</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Job satisfaction, intent-to-leave positions, and role concerns of academic administrators were first reported in the early 1990s, with concerns over the scope of mid-manager positions, such as the department chair discussed earlier. The following three selected research studies looked at the ­concerns of the academic administrators in the 1990s. More recent studies will be reported in the next section of this chapter.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Chieffo (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00255">1991</CitationRef>) explored factors related to organizational commitment and job satisfaction ­exhibited in leadership teams within community colleges in New Mexico. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Survey of Organizations, General Satisfaction Scale</Emphasis> (Taylor &amp; Bowers, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002542">1972</CitationRef>) measured job satisfaction, and the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Organizational Commitment Questionnaire</Emphasis> (<Emphasis Type="Italic">OCQ</Emphasis>) measured organizational commitment (Porter &amp; Smith, as cited in Cook, Hepworth, Wall, &amp; Warr, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00256">1981</CitationRef>). Scores on both scales indicated that administrators at these colleges were satisfied and committed to their colleges in their current roles. Role clarity was positively related to job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Being involved in decision-making meetings with the President was also deemed to be a significant factor in job satisfaction and overall commitment to the college.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Glick (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002512">1992</CitationRef>) was one of the first researchers to look at job satisfaction across Presidents, Vice Presidents, and Deans of liberal arts universities. The revised <Emphasis Type="Italic">Job Descriptive Index</Emphasis> (<Emphasis Type="Italic">JDI</Emphasis>) was the instrument to assess job satisfaction across five scales (Paul, Kravitz, Balzer, &amp; Smith, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002535">1990</CitationRef>). A key finding was that Vice Presidents and Deans reported dissatisfaction with the nature of their work. The Deans also demonstrated statistically significantly lowered scores on the Promotion and Supervision scales, as compared to Presidents. Not surprising, the median length of time in this position was reported to be less than 5 years. The author strongly encouraged that action be taken to improve job satisfaction in these critical management positions.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Murray and Murray (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002534">1998</CitationRef>) explored job satisfaction of Department Chairs in 2-year colleges in relation to intent-to-leave. The authors adapted a number of scales that measured job satisfaction, predisposition to vacate a position, and role perception in creating their own tool. A major demographic finding of importance was that the majority of Department Chairs (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  108; 39.0%) were in these positions under 5 years, with 70% (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  194) in positions under 10 years. The majority of Department Chairs did report high levels of job satisfaction and a low desire to leave. However, high role ambiguity and medium levels of role conflict were reported. Of concern was that, if these role dilemmas increased, desire to leave the institution would increase as well. Additional research in these areas was encouraged by all investigators of these above seminal works.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">More recently, in following up this line of investigation, Kuo (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002520">2009</CitationRef>) explored the relationships between academic faculty (staff) and administrators at one US public research university (using a qualitative research approach). It was found that the most satisfying and productive environment for all is when both the faculty and administrators maintained a cohesive and positive relationship with similar views on goals and ideals. In opposition, a fragmented experience occurred when a lack of interaction and misunderstandings occurred, which increased frustration and resulted in an “us versus them” division that can be destructive if it continues for any length of time. The author concluded that both groups must work in tandem in order to understand their similarities and differences in dealing with situations and challenges, and then find a common ground for the most harmonious work environment.</Para>

              <Heading>Research Specific to Nursing Academic Administrators</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Specific reference to the nursing academic administrators began in the 1980s. Not only do nursing academic administrators perform a host of typical Department Chair functions, but they also are responsible for a pre-licensure program to the state board of nursing and other credentialing agencies. This involves added responsibilities, such as negotiating with hospitals and clinical sites for student rotations; maintaining a skills lab with high fidelity simulation and technology; assuring that the curriculum meets current standard of practices; and the processing and admitting of students two or three times a year. As such, maintaining a “state of the art” nursing program, so that graduating students are well equipped to pass national boards and perform appropriately in a clinical setting, are additional critical elements. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab00254">25.4</InternalRef> presents a summary of these unique responsibilities for the nursing ­academic administrator. Early in the nursing education literature, concerns focused on the need to prepare and mentor those seeking nursing academic administrative positions (George, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002510">1981</CitationRef>; Hall, Mitsunaga, &amp; de Tornay, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002513">1981</CitationRef>). Too often, faculty are promoted into academic administrative positions without the necessary prerequisites for learning this position. The second issue raised addressed stress, workload, and role responsibility concerns (Carpenter, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00254">1989</CitationRef>, George &amp; Coudret, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002511">1986</CitationRef>). The following three studies review key findings specifically related to nursing academic administrators. The first study by Princeton and Gaspar (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002538">1991</CitationRef>) reiterated these concerns, and reported findings of first-line academic administrators, representing 42 schools that offered Bachelor and graduate degree nursing programs. Telephone surveys were conducted using a demographic data instrument, nine created questions that assessed on administrative experiences, and an adapted competency assessment for nursing academic administrators. With respect to overall stress and strain, nursing administrators reported that excessive workload that extended beyond the normal work day was causing the greatest strain. The second area of strain was related to managing their faculty, and faculty needs and conflicts. At that time, only 37.5% (21/56) reported that they were planning on continuing in their current administrative positions. Over 20 years ago, the authors concluded that issues related to workload and stress had to be addressed, or continued difficulties recruiting and retaining nursing ­academic administrators would remain problematic. Unfortunately, to this day, these troublesome issues are still present.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab00254">

              <Para TextBreak="No">Nursing academic administrators have once again been a population of interest over the last 5 years. High turnover, extended position announcements, and a lack of interest from potentially viable prospects was an increasing trend noted in the mid-2000s. Adams (<CitationRef CitationID="CR00251">2007</CitationRef>) explored factors that could influence nursing faculty to investigate or plan for future academic administrative positions. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Leadership Practice Inventory</Emphasis>, using both self and observer scales (Kouzes &amp; Posner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002519">2001</CitationRef>), and two investigator-created questionnaires that asked about response to recruitment into administration, along with career aspirations toward the future, were used. The faculty who participated in this study had a perception that academic administrative positions have high workloads, deal with increased conflict and working with conflicts, and are not granted a significantly different salary to offset the added workload. Only 18% of faculty participants shared that they might consider an academic administrative position in the future. Lack of training and/or preparation opportunities for advancement were also noted. Additionally, nursing academic administrators were asked if they would consider ­advancing into a higher administrative position. Workload, budget issues, and handling conflict were the three noted factors dissuading current administrators from pursuing another position in the future.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Mintz-Binder and Fitzpatrick (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002531">2009</CitationRef>) explored social support (Weinert, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002543">2003</CitationRef>) and job satisfaction (Spector, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002541">2005</CitationRef>) across nursing program directors (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  61) at community colleges in California. A number of unusual trends were noted for the first time in this study. First, there were 14 different titles stated for the Program Director position, ranging from Dean, Assistant or Associate Dean, to Department Chair to Nursing Directors. Secondly, there were 31 different combinations of nursing and non-nursing programs under management, with responsibility ranging from 1 to 9 different programs. Third, 15 (24.6%) stated that they were in interim positions at the time of the survey. Lastly, the mean age of respondents was 55.3 years old and all were female. Social support was rated above average, but did not specifically address support exclusive to the college setting. Job satisfaction was rated as average, with low means in operations, pay, promotion, and reward dimensions. The operations subscale looked at paperwork processing and the overall functioning of the nursing program within a college structure, and it was rated the lowest. Additionally, directors rated their stress as 8.03/10 on an investigator-created rating scale.</Para>

                <Heading>National Work Environment Study</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Noting the concerns expressed in the above studies, the National League for Nursing awarded a research grant in 2008 for a national study of nursing program directors within community colleges. The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire II</Emphasis> (<Emphasis Type="Italic">COPSOQII</Emphasis>) <Emphasis Type="Italic">Middle Version</Emphasis> was selected as the instrument to assess 28 subscales of work environment variables (Pejtersen, Kristensen, Borg, &amp; Bjorner, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002536">2010</CitationRef>). Survey monkey was used to email requests to 580 NLNAC-approved associate degree nursing (A.D.N.) programs. The response rate of useable surveys was 41.2% (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  242). Forty-two states were represented by respondents, as well as Washington, DC. The effect of work demand on the overall well-being of program directors was the first of three published studies (Mintz-Binder &amp; Sanders, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002532">2012</CitationRef>). The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Work Demand Scale</Emphasis> was designed to include measures of quantitative demands (tasks and amount of time needed), work pace (expected time to complete a task), and emotional demands (intensity of the work). The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health Well-Being Scale</Emphasis> was designed to include measures of one’s general overall physical functioning, physical and emotional exhaustion, level of tension and irritability, and assessment of sleep behavior related to their job (Mintz-Binder &amp; Sanders, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002532">2012</CitationRef>; Pejtersen et al., <CitationRef CitationID="CR002536">2010</CitationRef>). Values above 60, or below 40, are considered to be statistically different from the reported national average of 50. Possible median scores range from 0 to 100.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The <Emphasis Type="Italic">Work Demand Scale</Emphasis> was the highest of all scales, with a median of 63.5, indicating that the directors viewed their work demands as very high. The second highest calculated scale was the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Health Well-Being Scale</Emphasis> at 47.9. A positive statistical significance was found between these two scales with a Spearman’s Rho correlation of 0.523 (<Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis>  &lt;  0.01). The majority of the subscales within these two scales also correlated significantly. The highest correlation occurred between the stress and burnout subscales (<Emphasis Type="Italic">ρ</Emphasis>  =  0.83; <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis>  &lt;  0.01). Additionally, sleep-related concerns correlated highly with both stress and burnout (<Emphasis Type="Italic">ρ</Emphasis>  =  0.67;<Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis>  &lt;  0.01). Thus, the perception by A.D.N. directors and their faculty of a high workload associated with this position was validated in this study. However, what is most troubling is that the effect of workload on overall physical health and well-being is not being addressed. These positions continue to expand and grow while departmental budgets are either stagnant or reduced. The subsequent stress and burnout that follows will either cause the director to resign or, worse yet, become physically ill.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The second manuscript from this study reported the relationships among job satisfaction, role issues, and supervisor support of A.D.N. program directors (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002529">Mintz-Binder, accepted for publication</CitationRef>). The two scales that addressed these issues were <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Work-Individual Interface Scale</Emphasis> that included job satisfaction and work/family balance subscales, and the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Interpersonal Relationships/Leadership Scale</Emphasis> that included role clarity, role conflict, social support, and recognition subscales. All six of these subscales correlated with each other, with a range of Spearman’s <Emphasis Type="Italic">ρ</Emphasis> values of 0.24–0.68 (<Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis>  &lt;  0.01). These findings confirm that A.D.N. directors are struggling with job satisfaction, role clarity issues, role conflicts, insufficient supervisory support, and difficulties managing a work/family balance. Given the stress and the workload inherent in a management level position, adding these other variables to the overall portrait of this position does validate why recruitment into these positions is troublesome. Also reported was an inconsistent presence and use of assistant nursing program directors. With a goal of “on the job training” and succession planning for the future, the training and use of assistant ­nursing program directors would seem to be a critical need that has not been fully recognized.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The third manuscript looked specifically at a surprise finding of the presence of bullying reported by A.D.N. directors in this study (Mintz-Binder &amp; Calkins, accepted for publication). The definition of bullying was provided by the <Emphasis Type="Italic">COPSOQII</Emphasis> as “a person is repeatedly exposed to unpleasant or degrading ­treatment and that person finds it difficult to defend himself or herself against it” (Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00257">2003</CitationRef>). One-third of A.D.N. program directors reported bullying from students or faculty (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  77; 32.8%). Thirty-three of the 77 directors identified their nursing faculty as the primary offender, followed closely by 30 directors identifying students as the next largest group engaging in bullying. Seventy-four percent of directors who experience bullying reported it as occurring a few times over the last year (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  57). The highest percent of reported bullying was within their first year of their directorship (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  10; 13%), and the majority of bullying reported was by directors in their positions under 5 years (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  40; 51.9%). Also noteworthy was that none of the five male A.D.N. directors who responded to this survey reported any bullying behaviors toward them. When comparing subscale scores on the COPSOQII between directors reporting bullying to those who did not, those directors reporting bullying behaviors reported lowered self-rated health, higher stress, and increased sleep issues. The presence of bullying did appear to create a more difficult and more ­stressful work experience for these directors.</Para>

                <Heading>Pre-assessment of a Hardiness Study</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">In <CitationRef CitationID="CR002518">1979</CitationRef>, Kobasa introduced the concept of <Emphasis Type="Italic">hardiness</Emphasis> as a key variable in the assessment of stress and physical illness of male executives. Since that time, hardiness training programs have emerged to help offset high stress levels in administrators (Judkins &amp; Furlow, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002515">2003</CitationRef>). Nurse managers in the hospitals responded positively to hardiness training programs and, as such, determined that nursing academic program directors could also benefit from training was proposed. Funded by the National Organization of Associate Degree Nursing (NOADN) in 2010, this study assessed three components of <Emphasis Type="Italic">hardiness</Emphasis> in current A.D.N. program directors in the USA. The 15-item <Emphasis Type="Italic">Dispositional Resilience Scale-Hardiness</Emphasis> (Bartone, <CitationRef CitationID="CR00253">2007</CitationRef>) was the instrument selected to send through email via survey monkey to NLNAC-accredited nursing program directors. This scale can be subdivided into (a) <Emphasis Type="Italic">Commitment</Emphasis> that assesses if they are committed to their position and their proactive nature; (b) <Emphasis Type="Italic">Challenge</Emphasis> that assesses how accepting one is with challenges presented and whether they react in a positive way; and (c) <Emphasis Type="Italic">Control</Emphasis> that assesses how they view their own personal control over events and their response to stress. Of the 487 directors with viable emails, the response rate was 38.0% (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  184). The mean of <Emphasis Type="Italic">hardiness</Emphasis> was 31.51, with 51.6% (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  95) of directors exhibiting high hardiness, and 48.4% (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  89) exhibiting low hardiness. The three subscales correlated with each other, as well as with the total score of the instrument (<Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis>  &lt;  0.05). The amount of secretarial/clerical support correlated with the total hardiness scores and 2 of 3 subscales (<Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis>  &lt;  0.05). <Emphasis Type="Italic">Control</Emphasis> was the one subscale that did not reach statistical significance with secretarial/clerical support. However, when looking at the use and significance of an assistant director in the program, results were unexpected. Sixty nine percent of directors reported that they did not have an assistant program director assigned to their program. Of the 31% that did use an assistant director, the use varied from availability of 1–2 hours week, to having one or more full-time directors assigned. However, measures of <Emphasis Type="Italic">hardiness</Emphasis> did not correlate with any use of assistant directors. Those program directors who were fortunate to have more than one assistant director assigned, however, did report highest levels of <Emphasis Type="Italic">hardiness</Emphasis> (Mintz-Binder, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002528">2012</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Lindley and Mintz-Binder (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002521">2012</CitationRef>) thematically analyzed 346 comments made by these directors in response to a question asking each to share their top two critical issues that they face in their position. Faculty-related issues (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  99) was the highest, with comments about staffing, motivation, conflict, performance, and work ethic concerns. Workload issues (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  70) was second, with comments about too much to do, “wearing too many hats,” difficulty meeting administrative expectations, and no time for needed grant writing. Struggling with insufficient resources (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  40) was third, with comments about needing additional clerical support, clinical coordinators to assist with student clinical placements and program budgets and funding concerns. Dealing with student issues was fourth (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  35), with comments about their behaviors, lack of positive contact, processing course failures and subsequent grievances, and dealing with students’ parents. Supervisory Hierarchical Issues (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  18) was fifth, with comments about system issues, feelings of powerlessness and overall experiencing a lack of understanding from the higher administration. Lastly, issues related to the curriculum (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis>  =  14) surfaced, with comments about the curriculum needing improvements, constantly needing to maintain currency, and concerns over producing a high-quality nursing graduate.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">On the basis of the above results, hardiness training could be a very useful intervention for some of the nursing program directors as reflected by this study. Hardiness training involves a combination of lecture, discussion, role playing and group work with a cluster of participants. Topics range from assertiveness training, to negotiation skill development, to delegation and communication techniques. When in a discussion with nursing program directors, many reported that they did not have the financial support to attend because their departmental budgets had been cut due to financial issues. They also shared that they could not take the time to leave their workplace and attend a 2 or 3 day training such as this.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">The lack of effective use of assistant directors was also a surprising finding. When considering the high workload of these program directors, an available well-trained, assistant director would be the key person to offer positive and strong assistance to them. An assistant director would be a faculty member who was interested in an administrative opportunity in the future and would be the ideal person to learn the nuances of this position in succession planning for the future. If properly and systematically taught components of program managing, the assistant director would offer the most assistance to the program director to offset the workload and manage portions of the job responsibilities. The absence and/or underutilization of assistant program directors need further exploration in the future.</Para>

                <Heading>The Next Steps: Nursing and Beyond</Heading>
                <Para TextBreak="No">From the review of the prior studies, there is no question that nursing academic administrators are in need of significant intervention to offset their stress, decrease their workloads, and improve their overall health. What that intervention might be is currently being considered. It appears that an intervention needs to be brought to the directors rather than expecting them to attend a workshop or group meeting away from their college setting. Use of technology, such as podcasts, webinars, and/or ­conference calls, would be viable options. However, competing with the ­workload demands could provide a challenge too difficult to overcome. Academic nursing directors must see an intervention as meaningful and of value worthy of their attention to offset their work priorities at the scheduled time of an online activity. Nurses, and those in academia as well, are traditionally known to not always take care of themselves, or put themselves first, even if their health depends on it.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Additionally, appealing to the next generation of future nursing academic directors is critical for the success of the field of nursing and the developing profession. A focused approach to teaching the administrative role of academia to assistant directors is without question an essential need that is predominantly unrecognized and significantly underutilized. Exploring more about why this trend is occurring is a critical need for succession planning, as well as providing a hands-on learning opportunity for faculty who may be contemplating administrative careers in the future. Whether current directors feel that they are too overwhelmed to attempt to divert their energy to mentoring a novice assistant director, or they just do not have enough faculty to release someone a few hours a week to devote to learning the roles are major problems. The fact remains that not directly engaging a viable candidate is short-sighted and could have far-reaching consequences for the program should the director take ill or unexpectedly leave.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Although, at this time, the same level of studies has not been aimed at other non-nursing program directors or the administrative tier of universities, we can generalize that some, if not most, of these same findings may be occurring. A critical position in the university system that has received some attention, for example, is that of the University Research Administrator (URA). Katsapis (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002516">2010</CitationRef>) reported that URAs are under high levels of occupational stress and strain. The types of occupational stressors most commonly reported were role ambiguity and role overload. The level of role ambiguity reported was at a level that suggested the possibility of maladaptive stress responses could occur. From this study, it is safe to generalize that some university-based academic administrative positions are, in fact, experiencing high levels of stress and strain as well.</Para>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Raines and Alberg (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002539">2003</CitationRef>) made a poignant observation in stating that higher education apparently does not value the mid-level academic manager due to the lack of educational offerings for preparation of someone with this career objective. Without solid academic program offerings, academic administrators almost seem “set up” to fail. Rather, a prospective new leader has been quickly offered an interim chair or assistant dean for a short period of time and, hopefully, the work was mutually satisfying and appreciated by all involved parties. However, once in the actual permanent position, a high learning curve is expected. But preparation before assuming the position seems absent in academic environments, which truly is ironic. Why would programs that would successfully prepare future academic leaders be nonexistent or minimally available in institutions of higher learning? Certainly, the need is apparent. Without solid program offerings, a new administrator is left with “on the job training” which could be extremely valuable or unsatisfactory. Mentoring by a seasoned academic leader, either within or outside the institution, is critical. As part of the mentoring process, self-reflection, expanding listening and communicating skills with all levels of personnel, and committing to a process of continuous growth are essential recommended strategies. Hoppe (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002514">2003</CitationRef>) underscored the need for nurturing new and novice academic leaders. Helping new leaders make positive and appropriate decisions takes the development of fortitude, a characteristic that is not always present, or may not come forth without high-quality support, encouragement, and role modeling. Knowing that the transition from a program perspective to an organization perspective takes time, effort, and self-reflection is worth sharing with the new academic leader in supportive conversations. Hoppe also makes an excellent point when stating that a faculty member willing to move into a leadership role does not necessarily mean that person will be effective or successful. Finding a good future leader and nurturing that person through a transition from faculty to academic leader over time is one of the best and most efficient strategies.</Para>

              <Heading>Summary and Future Directions</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Although the focus of this chapter has been predominantly on the nursing academic director, it is fair to say that similar pressures, strains, and workloads are occurring throughout higher education. Faculty and administrators within community colleges, state colleges, universities, and the private colleges and universities are all feeling the effects of tighter budgets, less secretarial or clerical support, larger classes, increased online course offerings in distance education, as well as a shift toward older students who present with more complex personal, socioeconomic, and cultural challenges. The academic administrators at all levels must be poised, prepared, and ready to take on a host of challenges that continue to confront colleges and universities, from fluctuating budgets, to student athlete infractions, to the potential of terrorism or shootings on campus. Many of the issues reviewed in other chapters of this handbook (such as work-related strain and, its physiological/health consequences, occupational burnout, resiliency, social support, and bullying) were found to be active in the present “real world” of higher education. Thus, for example, doing what is necessary to prevent burnout is critical to maintain continuity and consistency in higher-education positions. Research and suggestions from Maslach et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR002526">2001</CitationRef>) suggested that changing the organizational structure is a better solution than focusing solely on changing the individual. The job environment plays a major role in whether an administrator feels job satisfaction, work overload, stress and, ultimately, burnout. Being cognizant of mismatches of qualified applicants, yet perhaps not a good match for the institution or the administrative position, is critical. In this time of fewer available or qualified future administrators, placing someone rather than the “right one” is of great concern. As academic administrative positions continue to grow, change and expand, extremely qualified applicants with the proper training, personality characteristics, and vision should only be considered. No doubt, positions that are overwhelming and have grown beyond the capability of one person must be reassessed and divided accordingly.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Not only does offering courses or degrees specifically in higher education academic administration seem critical, but also nurturing and mentoring the careers of viable future administrators appears equally essential. When workload increases or budgets tighten, it seems to follow that extending mentoring opportunities or engaging in quality dialog about these roles simply vanishes. The risk to the academic institution is extremely high when a dedicated succession plan is either placed “on hold” or not initiated in a focused and dedicated way. The time may very well be now for top-tier administrators to take note of what these current studies reviewed in this chapter are displaying, and address concerns related to work demand, stress, burnout, job satisfaction, role confusion, potential for bullying, and the lack of succession planning occurring in some higher education organizations. Managing and feeling the financial effects of turnover can be extremely taxing when institutions are already feeling fiscal restraints. Presidents and Vice Presidents need to take the time to connect with stressed and overloaded mid-level administrators. Making that effort may bring forth extremely positive rewards and offset a prospective vacancy which would only strengthen that college, and be seen in a very positive light.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">So why would someone consider a career as an Academic Administrator after reading this chapter? There is no question that this is a demanding role with a steep learning curve and is not a position that any seasoned faculty member can subsume. However, for those who have personality characteristics and ambition to succeed in academic administrative careers, the rewards are quite positive. Achieving a higher professional status, higher salary, and higher institutional recognition are a few of the extrinsic rewards attributed to administrative advancement (Murphy, <CitationRef CitationID="CR002533">2003</CitationRef>). One of the strongest intrinsic rewards of an Academic Administrator is the sense of making a difference or leaving behind a strong legacy. Meeting one’s personal leadership goals or aspirations is another very strong intrinsic reward for some people. Ultimately, it appears to be a need or willingness to serve others that may in fact be the strongest motivation. Whatever the motivation might be, balancing all aspects and complexities of this role, along with handling the inherent stress and crises, are critical. Planning far ahead for a future in academic administration, and taking necessary steps to prepare including early mentoring, seems to be the best strategy for success. Taking the time to learn about the future position (the scope, the job description, the expectations as well as beginning the process of self-assessment) are critical steps at this preparatory stage. Improving one’s communication skill-set, which includes critical listening as well as effective and transparent responses, would also be essential at this time. Finding a quality mentor and beginning the mentoring process before transitioning into a leadership role would also be extremely advantageous and useful. There is no question that there is a need for well-prepared future academic administrators in the near future. There also appears to be a great need to contain and control these positions at the organizational level if recruiting efforts are to be successful. High-stress positions with role ambiguity and extreme workloads are not currently appealing to this generation of new faculty, adding to the concern of expanding vacancies in academic administration. The process of increasing job descriptions beyond an appropriate workload of those in middle management positions cannot continue if recruiting the best and most competent person for the job remains the priority. Sadly, many with the qualities and proper preparation will not take on high-stress positions because they understand the effect of stress on one’s physical health. At what point and with what number of vacancies need exist for serious reconstitution of these Academic Administrative positions to occur? In the midst of a lack of qualified Academic Administrator applicants, when will positions be brought back to reasonable levels? At what point will proper succession planning occur at the administrative levels in order to prepare the future academic leaders?
