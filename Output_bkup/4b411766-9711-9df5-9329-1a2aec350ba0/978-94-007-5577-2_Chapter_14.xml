              <Para>Shipping transports the majority of goods traded internationally and although it is acknowledged as being the most efficient and the most environmentally friendly mode of transport it is also an important contributor to anthropogenic emissions. An integrated assessment is made of the use of an Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) for the year 2020 to reduce the emissions from international ships entering European Community ports.</Para>

              <Para>We use EX-TREMIS and EUROSTAT databases and emission factors from the EMMOSS study to construct a spatially explicit database projections for 2016, 2020, and 2030 that account for activity data and port callings. The database distinguishes between 7 vessel types and 5 size classes. The emission baseline takes into account several recently adopted policy measures. The most recent ones being the additional measures to reduce NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> and SO<Subscript>2</Subscript> from maritime emissions according to the amendments of October 2008 to MARPOL ANNEX VI. The most important conclusions from the emission analysis were as follows: <UnorderedList Mark="Bullet">

              <Para>On the basis of aggregated NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> marginal abatement cost curves for land based (LB), land based + maritime emissions (12 nm zone + ports) and land based + maritime emissions (EU waters) for the conservative (Scen1) and optimistic (Scen2) scenarios, we see that between a trading price of 1 and 3.5 k€/ton the potential for reducing more NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions is higher for the maritime sector (especially emissions in the EU waters). For SO<Subscript>2</Subscript> there is very limited reduction potential for SO<Subscript>2</Subscript>. This is a result of the strengthening of the environmental legislation for SO<Subscript>2</Subscript> emissions in the maritime sector which will come into force after 2016. In fact the remaining maritime emissions even at higher trading prices such as 10 k€/ton will be very low compared to land based emissions and so the opportunities to reduce SO<Subscript>2</Subscript> further will be very limited.</Para>
              <Para>On the basis of the aggregated marginal abatement cost curves for land based emissions, maritime emissions for 12 nm zone + ports and maritime emissions from EU waters – we could set up different emission trading scenarios.

              <Para>We considered two fixed price scenarios and fixed volume scenarios. In the fixed price scenarios we keep the trading price at the level of a corresponding IPPC land base scenario. Including emissions of the maritime sector results in additional emissions reduction of maritime emissions and the level of land based IPPC emissions remains the same.</Para>
              <Para>For all scenarios the costs and benefits are evaluated in an integrated impact assessment. The BelEUROS model was used as a dispersion model to evaluated spatially explicit emission reduction scenarios and produce concentrations and deposition maps.

              <Para>Based on the integrated impact assessment we conclude that there is an additional benefit of including the maritime sector in a land based ETS, but only if the trading price is sufficiently high. A scenario which sets the NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> trading price at 1,194€/ton, results in significant improvements – however we view that it would be more effective to restrict the maritime emissions to the 12 nm zone + ports zones in the EU because: <OrderedList>

                      <Para>the legal analysis indicates all vessels (EC and non-EC) can be required to join an ETS regime in ports (+ internal waters) and territorial seas (i.e. within the 12 nm zone). This means that a cap on maritime emissions can be imposed and the scheme is not voluntary.</Para>

                      <Para>the effectiveness of emissions abated in the 12 nm zone + ports zones, although much lower in volume, are more effective in terms of reducing environmental impacts than emissions abated in all EU waters.</Para>

                </OrderedList> One practical problem that would have to be resolved is that due to the fact that foreign ships enjoy the “right of innocent passage” in territorial seas no construction, design, equipment and manning (CDEM measures), going beyond the generally accepted international rules and standards, may be involved. To ensure that an ETS is robust and secure requires a full proof monitoring and verification scheme – this means that ships would need to install equipment such as the on-line Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS), which is currently not a standard equipment for all ships.</Para>
              <Para>For this reason the European Commission or Member States might want to consider alternative market based instruments or measures to reduce NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions from ships, such as differentiated kilometer charges, taxation, port dues and subsidies.</Para>
